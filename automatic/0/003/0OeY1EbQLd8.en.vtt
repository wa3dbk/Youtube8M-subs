00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.580
 We want to take a look at the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.830
 logitech ultras in keyboard mini keyboard 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.210
 for ipad mini this is my keyboard 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.010
 cover we already have that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.340
 unpacked look at us exactly 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.230
 on 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.369
 in the box with at the lies 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.660
 usual we have one 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390
 user manual we have one 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 small micro USB charging cable around the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 to charge the integrated battery 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.269
 keyboard our little cleaning cloth nothing 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 what we really need and me 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.420
 now want the ipad with us 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 look at the whole thing in action 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 ipad mini is known as far as we know 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.140
 have a grow here becomes the smart 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 cover on it and black smart cover is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 yes moored on the side here with so 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.809
 a magnetic lock and on the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 same principle also sets this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.079
 logitech keyboard 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.420
 it's on the side of us here 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.020
 a little tournament in there is that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 also magnetic and that's exactly what you can do 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.910
 just like our body before that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.520
 Click on the left side of the cover 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 even includes quite well was with 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.900
 the ipad mini I think that might be the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280
 Close up still show we have 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.729
 at the side here in a bluetooth 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.799
 button 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.369
 because on the switch and here the micro 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.720
 USB port to charge the battery 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.150
 From close up, she looks at the story 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.460
 then from the left side of the micro 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.409
 usb port of the switch in the middle of the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.270
 press camera you may see it 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.930
 so a little bit on one 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.189
 side also already light green 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.470
 Savings on the other one 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.240
 slight red and then you look up 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.380
 which position is currently folded 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.030
 the bluetooth button 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 you only need this at the initial 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 So pairing once the ipad mini once 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.810
 It is necessary to connect with a keyboard 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.369
 do not come out there and as soon as the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 Keyboard otherwise connects the quasi 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.899
 in I would say about ten 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.700
 seconds with the ipad history yes 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.979
 times to and we see it is relatively 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.930
 that's exactly what it's all about 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.890
 all sides and I would stand 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.460
 say half a millimeter over on the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.460
 front edge 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.340
 if we take the keyboard is used 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.580
 then we want to work out the story 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 Just go to the ipad or drag it 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.230
 ipad magnets off and on 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.000
 the whole thing had just pure in 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.070
 its easy angle always here then 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.090
 Inside the keyboard keeps quite neat 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.540
 So I can also go back and forth 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.710
 to press 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.070
 that's fine and we have the keyboard 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.450
 to be able to write directly on it 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.050
 So let's have a look at the atom at the live 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:37.020
 use 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:38.940
 I have a slightly larger one now 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.390
 voted out and the whole thing yes 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.070
 used the keys themselves is always 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.110
 difficult to describe pressure points like this 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.490
 but they are doing quite well 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.900
 and I would say it is comparable 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.620
 with the original apple bluetooth 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.500
 keyboards 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.970
 So you have to take note of it 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.380
 click one has a bit of the same 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.300
 play in it but the keys are not 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.190
 because I have the faint light back and forth 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.390
 but you can put your finger on it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.800
 and only if one strikes then 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.750
 it works the same way 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.820
 should work 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.440
 we know about the others 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.060
 operational purposes of the keyboard I think to 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.250
 to describe you similarly big further 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.170
 as if the possibility here has the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.780
 click on homebutton we can in 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.010
 play and break make music in the music 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.600
 just can run in the background 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.880
 continue to jump forward and backward 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.530
 have extra button to the volume 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.910
 to adjust or the device 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.160
 mute and even have one 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.230
 button with the one series 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.230
 can then serve here at the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.000
 page up as well as button around directly in 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.459
 the search to jump in that one knows 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 from the iPad but directly what I had 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.580
 just enter here on textastic 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.739
 for my sake and the whole story 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.870
 then open again 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.760
 the special keys we look at once 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.959
 detailed on the keyboard on it 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.190
 that maybe very important because we 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.590
 here also with the german keyboard 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.600
 or work we have the umlauts 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.410
 specially created as keys so there 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.850
 we do not need one now 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.080
 Function key move with it 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.690
 can write the same goes for 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.820
 the sz above is just a number 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.320
 and we have the delete button here 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.850
 what i put in the corner 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.160
 Personally, I think that's pretty good 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.900
 once the other alternative to 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.090
 Look at the market then you have the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.070
 more often in the second row and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.100
 above that he is still a symbol 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.470
 because of me also volume button and 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.760
 if you write such a flow and 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.829
 one is used to the top right for 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.599
 delete press 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.849
 You miss it from time to time here 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.099
 that is not the case there is one more 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.689
 Special button around the keyboard spoke 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.860
 Change I can always impress 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.840
 then you can between the 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.520
 international keyboards back and forth 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.770
 switch which we have activated here 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.530
 Maybe I should go now 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.330
 take the Germans again 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.590
 and as I said, is a wonderful one 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.789
 keyboard i can not care at all 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.229
 I do not really have anything to complain about 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.930
 It bothers me here and we look at each other 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.349
 with the keys again from a something 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.699
 honing distance so that gives faith 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.639
 I just fine more impression above left 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.259
 the home button then the bar with the 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.360
 where are we then the 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.159
 Special keys have play pause and 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.639
 so on and so on on the right 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:04.219
 then the umlaute and below 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.629
 the cursor keys control command et 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.090
 cetera you need of course if 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.409
 the whole story to the full ipad 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.250
 We can use the service 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.250
 maybe the video again 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.449
 link apology to the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.099
 last talked about that me 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.379
 almost the complete ipad with the 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.029
 Keyboard controls let apps be 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.430
 State one can get out of the apps again 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:24.199
 jump different applications 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.349
 select maybe we link that 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.699
 Again, the video and the 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.240
 it was by and large with the 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.360
 Completing logitech keyboard should we 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.650
 possibly go back to 12 basics 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.229
 Of course, the iPad can be upended 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.120
 putting in is much better 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.440
 if you have it in landscape format or 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.120
 I personally have the feeling that is 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.349
 then not so wobbly so 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.000
 already thought that the whole 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.560
 explain things but it works too 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.029
 in portrait format if you have a text editor 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.020
 has the more going on it has the battery 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.569
 click this again to the side 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.860
 on the wrong side 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:02.569
 the battery lasts for three months the keyboard 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.650
 itself turns off by itself 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.900
 So that someday goes to a son 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.669
 battery saving mode purely as you press 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.830
 just a button and activate the 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.000
 so that means you have when you are 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.069
 which did not use for half an hour 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.139
 you have to add another three seconds 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.490
 wait before you can use them again 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.990
 after you put a button on it 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.029
 otherwise has pressed as I said three 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.310
 months with a charge the whole thing 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.050
 works incredibly well here 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.279
 case the ipad is not on the 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.600
 feel for it otherwise it has so little 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:29.570
 spacers still in there 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.070
 is about yes I would say exactly like that 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.710
 fat may even soap mini 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.710
 two millimeters smaller at the 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.560
 pages and is an incredible 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.390
 more pleasant companion so i had 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.160
 already quite a lot of keyboard 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.140
 options for ipad in hand and can 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.870
 here a pronounced recommendation 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.640
 pronounce it says so 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.160
 but probably buy recommendations from 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.550
 good workmanship on my part 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.780
 keystrokes connected immediately 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.670
 the battery lasts a long time you have the 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.230
 special keys what more could you want me to say 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.950
 Thank you for watching and wishing 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.950
 a nice offline
