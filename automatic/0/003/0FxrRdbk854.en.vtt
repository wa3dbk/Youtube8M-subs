00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hey guys and welcome to this blender 2.6

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.720 
hey guys and welcome to this blender 2.6
explain<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.200> video<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.250> video<00:00:05.430> I'm

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
explain the video in this video I'm

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.120 
explain the video in this video I'm
going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> be<00:00:06.000> explaining<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.810> origin<00:00:07.130> now

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
going to be explaining the origin now

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.339 
going to be explaining the origin now
the<00:00:08.189> origin<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.179> little<00:00:09.540> orange<00:00:09.719> dot<00:00:10.110> in

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
the origin is this little orange dot in

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.499 
the origin is this little orange dot in
the<00:00:10.590> center<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.920> your<00:00:11.010> object<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.269> show

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the center of your object and I can show

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.390 
the center of your object and I can show
you<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:13.019> exactly<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> looks<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.190> it's

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
you just exactly what it looks like it's

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.019 
you just exactly what it looks like it's
just<00:00:14.460> an<00:00:14.880> orange<00:00:15.179> dot<00:00:16.250> now<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.640> reason<00:00:17.789> this

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
just an orange dot now the reason this

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.000 
just an orange dot now the reason this
thing's<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> point

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
thing's here is so that you have a point

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.210 
thing's here is so that you have a point
to<00:00:20.850> rotate<00:00:21.449> or<00:00:21.689> scale<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:22.289> object<00:00:22.769> around<00:00:22.980> in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
to rotate or scale your object around in

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.650 
to rotate or scale your object around in
3d<00:00:23.490> space<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.779> i<00:00:24.900> go<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.210> i<00:00:27.210> left

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
3d space so if i go here and i left

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
3d space so if i go here and i left
click<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.170> move<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.619> 3d<00:00:28.980> cursor<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.429> two

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
click and move my 3d cursor or two

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.640 
click and move my 3d cursor or two
different<00:00:29.730> spot<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.630> move<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.050> origin<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
different spot i can move that origin to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
different spot i can move that origin to
that<00:00:31.769> 3d<00:00:31.980> cursor<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> shortcut<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.719> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that 3d cursor now the shortcut for that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
that 3d cursor now the shortcut for that
is<00:00:34.110> ctrl<00:00:34.620> alt<00:00:34.920> shift<00:00:35.100> +<00:00:35.850> C<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.770> then<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.250> can

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
is ctrl alt shift + C and then you can

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
is ctrl alt shift + C and then you can
go<00:00:39.079> for<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.440> 3d<00:00:40.739> cursor<00:00:41.270> now<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.480> rotate<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
go for the 3d cursor now if I rotate it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.729 
go for the 3d cursor now if I rotate it
it'll<00:00:43.379> rotate<00:00:43.559> around<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.579> spot<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.710> then<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it'll rotate around that spot and then I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670 
it'll rotate around that spot and then I
can<00:00:46.980> also<00:00:47.160> scale<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> x-axis<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.379> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
can also scale it on the x-axis or just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.590 
can also scale it on the x-axis or just
scale<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.250> general<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.820> scale<00:00:51.120> around

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
scale in general and will scale around

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.740 
scale in general and will scale around
that<00:00:51.840> point<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:52.460> ok<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.670> couple<00:00:54.629> other

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that point right there ok a couple other

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.160 
that point right there ok a couple other
ways<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> move<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.500> around<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:57.809> can

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
ways to move this around is you can

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
ways to move this around is you can
select<00:00:58.379> faces<00:00:59.030> vertices<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.680> edges<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.719> press

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
select faces vertices or edges and press

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.660 
select faces vertices or edges and press
shift<00:01:03.989> s<00:01:04.170> crush<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.860> shoe<00:01:04.979> selected<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
shift s crush your shoe selected and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
shift s crush your shoe selected and
that'll<00:01:06.510> move<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.750> cursor<00:01:06.960> over<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that'll move your cursor over there and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
that'll move your cursor over there and
then<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> edit<00:01:09.810> mode<00:01:10.140> any

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
then if you go out of edit mode any

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.120 
then if you go out of edit mode any
press<00:01:10.890> ctrl<00:01:11.280> alt<00:01:11.549> shift<00:01:11.700> C<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.470> origin

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
press ctrl alt shift C and then origin

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
press ctrl alt shift C and then origin
to<00:01:14.490> 3d<00:01:15.420> cursor<00:01:15.570> again<00:01:16.049> that'll<00:01:16.500> move<00:01:16.619> your

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to 3d cursor again that'll move your

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
to 3d cursor again that'll move your
origin<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.430> spot<00:01:17.900> now<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> couple<00:01:19.259> other

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
origin to that spot now a couple other

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.399 
origin to that spot now a couple other
ways<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.400> origin<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.360> used<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.049> when

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
ways this origin to you is used is when

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.800 
ways this origin to you is used is when
you<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:23.840> having<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.080> multiple<00:01:25.530> objects<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
you are having like multiple objects and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
you are having like multiple objects and
you<00:01:27.810> haven't<00:01:28.229> been<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:28.979> rotating

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you haven't been when you're rotating

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039 
you haven't been when you're rotating
around<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.750> different

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
around stuff you can have different

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.560 
around stuff you can have different
pivot<00:01:31.320> points<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.670> active<00:01:33.119> element

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
pivot points so if you do active element

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
pivot points so if you do active element
this<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.110> active<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.680> it'll<00:01:35.159> rotate

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
this is your active one it'll rotate

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.410 
this is your active one it'll rotate
around<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> origin<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.329> your<00:01:36.479> active<00:01:36.900> object

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
around the origin of your active object

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.749 
around the origin of your active object
and<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.869> median<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.549> kind

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and you can do median which is just kind

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.020 
and you can do median which is just kind
of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> center<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> origins<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
of the center of all the origins and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
of the center of all the origins and
individual<00:01:45.030> origins<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.720> rotate<00:01:46.110> your

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
individual origins will rotate your

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.170 
individual origins will rotate your
objects<00:01:46.740> around<00:01:46.890> each<00:01:47.250> origin<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
objects around each origin like that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.899 
objects around each origin like that
when<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.659> multiple<00:01:48.810> selected<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.909> 3d

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
when you have multiple selected and 3d

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
when you have multiple selected and 3d
cursor<00:01:51.060> doesn't<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.810> origins

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
cursor doesn't have to do with origins

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.910 
cursor doesn't have to do with origins
just<00:01:52.740> where<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.159> 3d<00:01:53.490> cursor<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just where your 3d cursor is and of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.889 
just where your 3d cursor is and of
course<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> last<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.180> default<00:01:57.600> one

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
course the last one is the default one

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
course the last one is the default one
and<00:01:58.170> that's<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.189> bounding<00:01:59.549> box<00:01:59.790> which

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and that's just your bounding box which

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.209 
and that's just your bounding box which
is<00:02:00.270> basically<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.350> center<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:02.040> your

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is basically the center of all your

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
is basically the center of all your
objects<00:02:02.729> alright<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> add

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
objects alright so I'm just going to add

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.819 
objects alright so I'm just going to add
another<00:02:05.430> cube<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.320> one<00:02:07.320> other<00:02:07.439> thing<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
another cube here one other thing the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.059 
another cube here one other thing the
origin<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.280> used<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
origin is used for is when you have a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.370 
origin is used for is when you have a
parent<00:02:11.760> or<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.209> child<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
parent or a child of a

parent or a child of a
so<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.850> hold<00:02:15.000> down<00:02:15.260> shift<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
so I'm just going to hold down shift and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.220 
so I'm just going to hold down shift and
press<00:02:16.650> ctrl<00:02:16.860> P<00:02:17.340> an<00:02:17.580> object<00:02:18.300> as<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.080> see

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
press ctrl P an object as you can see

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.080 
press ctrl P an object as you can see
when<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.440> move<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.710> around<00:02:19.890> its<00:02:20.430> object<00:02:20.880> moves

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
when I move this around its object moves

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.650 
when I move this around its object moves
with<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.050> child<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.920> object

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
with it so this is child of this object

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
with it so this is child of this object
alright<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.620> want<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.890> move<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.520> origin

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
alright so if I want to move this origin

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.210 
alright so if I want to move this origin
to<00:02:27.270> my<00:02:27.540> parents<00:02:27.930> origin<00:02:28.380> what<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:28.980> is

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
to my parents origin what I can do is

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.000 
to my parents origin what I can do is
just<00:02:29.250> press<00:02:29.730> alt<00:02:30.030> oh<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:31.470> move<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.890> that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
just press alt oh and now move to that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.730 
just press alt oh and now move to that
spot<00:02:32.340> now<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.300> exactly<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.140> same<00:02:34.470> as

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
spot now that's just exactly the same as

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.170 
spot now that's just exactly the same as
if<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.880> press<00:02:36.480> alt<00:02:36.750> r<00:02:37.050> or<00:02:37.410> alt<00:02:37.860> s<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.610> LG

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
if you are to press alt r or alt s or LG

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.930 
if you are to press alt r or alt s or LG
and<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:40.020> reset<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.950> location

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
and that will reset your location

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.150 
and that will reset your location
rotation<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.480> scale<00:02:42.720> as<00:02:42.930> well<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.680> origin

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
rotation and scale as well and so origin

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.900 
rotation and scale as well and so origin
is<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.880> same<00:02:45.210> list<00:02:46.700> if<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> have

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
is just on that same list if you have

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.760 
is just on that same list if you have
multiple<00:02:48.030> objects<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.930> you're<00:02:49.470> joining

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
multiple objects and you're joining

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.280 
multiple objects and you're joining
these<00:02:49.950> objects<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.820> object<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.660> active

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
these objects the object that is active

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.250 
these objects the object that is active
is<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.880> used<00:02:54.360> for<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.810> origin

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
is the one that is used for the origin

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.410 
is the one that is used for the origin
alright<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.520> active<00:02:56.880> one<00:02:57.060> lilith

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
alright so this is the active one lilith

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.090 
alright so this is the active one lilith
has<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> brighter<00:02:58.050> orange<00:02:58.380> selection<00:02:58.980> around

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100

ok also your widget is centered around

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.100 
ok also your widget is centered around
your<00:03:09.150> origin<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.330> move<00:03:12.600> by

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
your origin so if I just move by

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.660 
your origin so if I just move by
ordering<00:03:13.530> 23<00:03:13.680> course<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.370> see<00:03:14.520> the
