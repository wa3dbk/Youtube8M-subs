00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
let's see here so I'm going to start

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.309 
let's see here so I'm going to start
creating<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.400> background<00:02:43.849> on<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.540> sheet<00:02:45.200> of

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
creating a background on this sheet of

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.050 
creating a background on this sheet of
paper<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.860> comes<00:02:46.130> in<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> kit<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.760> one<00:02:46.940> of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
paper that comes in the kit it's one of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.490 
paper that comes in the kit it's one of
basic<00:02:47.480> grades<00:02:47.750> papers<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.349> little

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
basic grades papers so I get a little

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.960 
basic grades papers so I get a little
ink<00:02:51.860> on<00:02:52.069> my<00:02:52.099> dabber<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:55.099> I<00:02:55.370> think<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.670> want<00:02:55.819> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970

ink on my dabber and I think I want to
just<00:02:56.120> kind<00:02:56.329> of<00:02:57.040> color<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.459> edges<00:02:58.819> a<00:02:58.849> little

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
just kind of color the edges a little

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.640 
just kind of color the edges a little
bit<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.530> can<00:03:03.650> see<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:05.500> dab<00:03:06.500> it

bit so you can see you can just dab it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.059 
bit so you can see you can just dab it
on<00:03:06.799> if<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.549> want<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.849> set<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.269> down<00:03:08.299> or<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:10.040> can
