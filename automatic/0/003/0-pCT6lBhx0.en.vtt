00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 then bad then there was and captain blocks 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.300
 that a movie that you really enjoyed 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.630
 i believe in the camillus and big no and captain 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.630
 harlock 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.660
 order 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.140
 for me the character of harlock is the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.090
 older the older one 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.310
 it was a work immediately 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.360
 following the period of the second 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.200
 world War 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.629
 my father was a pilot and unfortunately neither 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.739
 on the war field he lost so many gods 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.110
 his of the people he drove and said 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.520
 precisely how it was useless to do 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.640
 battles 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.970
 I already wondered in those days but the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.550
 machines what kind of elements are 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.700
 they can help us fly i thought i was 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.090
 appears if the Martians existed says yes 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.759
 perhaps there may be no and therefore precisely 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.680
 there were various dreams I remember there was 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.930
 just this word do it anyway 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.700
 it was like almost 1 but topeka and inside of 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.680
 I didn't even know why 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.860
 so many resonated with character 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.920
 that he had a pirate flag was 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.080
 something I wanted to paint that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.610
 however it could from space and this is 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.560
 was the kind of awakening I have 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.320
 had it is so that just the years 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.640
 meaning harlock character 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.150
 of its of its flag with the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.180
 skull and means freedom and me holding 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.490
 all this mind more and more always 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.520
 more I want to create new ones 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.750
 narrations of the new stories because I 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.960
 still many dreams and as an author 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.420
 as creator creator I probably 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.130
 I have not even a tenth of a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.509
 all of them dreams in the mind not 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.280
 so from now on i want 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.340
 keep giving me to do give of mine 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.340
 better 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.599
 certainly now this is an animation in 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.430
 computer graphics with 3D images 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.049
 obviously different than the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.930
 animation and hand drawn because 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.239
 use the computer 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.439
 originally to be able to create 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.439
 all these images 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:46.430
 probably 5,000 people would be needed 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:48.319
 if one wanted to do it by hand we find ourselves 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.030
 right now he has a great bible a 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.709
 big point of change e 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.970
 probably I can say that from 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.510
 this view we are in a beautiful 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.189
 position we are at the beginning of one 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.950
 new era is a new journey of harlock 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:08.120
 that just started and there is one thing that 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.450
 I would also like to say here and in pour 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.980
 tears is absolutely not a shame 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.389
 and instead it is shameful to stop e 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.699
 give up 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.840
 so it is always important to be able to 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.000
 to cry 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.879
 as long as you keep going on while 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.909
 that you don't give up this is what 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.549
 I would like to make young people understand this 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.979
 It is the message that precisely and this 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.169
 not only to young Japanese but to 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:39.109
 young people of all the world that 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:41.829
 can be pushed and stimulated by 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.829
 my works thanks
