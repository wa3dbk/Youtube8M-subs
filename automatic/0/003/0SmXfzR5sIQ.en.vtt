across it on the beach really means they
have<00:01:54.390> struck<00:01:54.780> gold

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
have struck gold

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.539 
have struck gold
and<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.840> gold<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.530> ocean<00:01:59.829> waves<00:02:00.070> is<00:02:00.310> used

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
and that gold of the ocean waves is used

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.880 
and that gold of the ocean waves is used
to<00:02:00.700> make<00:02:00.850> perfume<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.960> slab<00:02:02.259> found<00:02:02.619> could

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
to make perfume the slab found could

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.529 
to make perfume the slab found could
enrich<00:02:03.159> around<00:02:03.520> six<00:02:03.850> thousand<00:02:04.329> bottles

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
enrich around six thousand bottles

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.230 
enrich around six thousand bottles
giving<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.560> fragrance<00:02:05.950> depth<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.549> allowing

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
giving the fragrance depth and allowing

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.990 
giving the fragrance depth and allowing
it<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.360> last<00:02:07.689> for<00:02:07.960> up<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.110> eight<00:02:08.410> hours<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
it to last for up to eight hours the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.940 
it to last for up to eight hours the
reason<00:02:10.330> why<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.569> becomes<00:02:10.989> so<00:02:11.170> valuable<00:02:11.709> is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
reason why it becomes so valuable is

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.440 
reason why it becomes so valuable is
that<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.250> starts<00:02:12.640> off<00:02:12.790> with<00:02:12.849> this<00:02:13.180> sort<00:02:13.390> of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that it starts off with this sort of

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.280 
that it starts off with this sort of
sticky<00:02:13.920> liquid<00:02:14.920> viscous<00:02:15.489> substance<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:17.050> then

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
sticky liquid viscous substance but then

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.199 
sticky liquid viscous substance but then
over<00:02:17.800> time<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.760> waves<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.170> sunshine<00:02:21.209> beating
