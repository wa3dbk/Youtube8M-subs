all of them all the processors that it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.420 
all of them all the processors that it
will<00:04:48.400> support<00:04:48.870> based<00:04:49.870> on<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:51.550> files<00:04:51.970> version

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
will support based on this files version

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.500 
will support based on this files version
so<00:04:54.430> as<00:04:54.550> you<00:04:54.640> can<00:04:54.730> see<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.000> lists<00:04:55.330> all<00:04:55.450> the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
so as you can see it lists all the

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.680 
so as you can see it lists all the
processors<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:55.990> we<00:04:56.230> can<00:04:56.380> have<00:04:56.560> in<00:04:56.680> there

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
processors that we can have in there

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.770 
processors that we can have in there
just<00:04:58.690> quite<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> few<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.910> didn't<00:05:01.270> show<00:05:01.450> us<00:05:01.600> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
just quite a few it didn't show us the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.010 
just quite a few it didn't show us the
ram<00:05:02.280> but<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:04.030> look<00:05:04.240> at<00:05:04.360> something<00:05:04.540> like<00:05:04.690> this

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
ram but you look at something like this

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.280 
ram but you look at something like this
