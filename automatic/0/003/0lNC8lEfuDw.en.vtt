black ops 2 and give you some reasons
why<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.300> why<00:00:09.480> if<00:00:09.660> maybe<00:00:09.840> they've<00:00:09.990> mapped<00:00:10.139> my

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
why and why if maybe they've mapped my

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.440 
why and why if maybe they've mapped my
behavior<00:00:10.740> by<00:00:10.920> some<00:00:11.160> simpler<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> eyes<00:00:12.120> good

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
replayability value because you can you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
replayability value because you can you
can<00:00:39.300> build<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> golden<00:00:39.719> spork<00:00:40.020> even<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.620> build

it you could go in sport held achiever
blundergat<00:00:43.350> acid<00:00:44.160> kit<00:00:45.320> where<00:00:46.320> else<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.559> there

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
blundergat acid kit where else is there

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
blundergat acid kit where else is there
on<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.770> map<00:00:47.010> yeah<00:00:47.129> ask<00:00:47.430> kit<00:00:47.789> blundergat<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
on that map yeah ask kit blundergat and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
on that map yeah ask kit blundergat and
then<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> had<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> could<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:51.180> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
different stats which is like if you add

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.130 
different stats which is like if you add
up<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.449> weapon<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> map<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
up all the one weapon of the map you

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.600 
up all the one weapon of the map you
count<00:01:04.439> stabs<00:01:04.830> there's<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.220> different<00:01:05.489> ones

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

on<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> crazy<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.930> use

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
on this now which is crazy you can use

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
on this now which is crazy you can use
the<00:01:10.170> four<00:01:10.380> unupgraded<00:01:10.650> before<00:01:11.310> upgraded<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the four unupgraded before upgraded the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
the four unupgraded before upgraded the
Borrego<00:01:12.180> mark<00:01:12.390> 2<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> regular<00:01:13.170> ray<00:01:13.290> gun

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
Borrego mark 2 and the regular ray gun

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
Borrego mark 2 and the regular ray gun
which<00:01:14.250> makes<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> map<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.210> diverse<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.810> can

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
which makes the map very diverse you can

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
which makes the map very diverse you can
use<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.380> sort<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
use what sort of things and you got the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
use what sort of things and you got the
generators<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.869> power<00:01:19.110> don't

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
generators that you have power don't

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
generators that you have power don't
unpack<00:01:19.710> punch<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> Thunder

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
unpack punch you can get the Thunder

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.050 
unpack punch you can get the Thunder
fist<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.080> um<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> disk

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
fist you can um you have to get the disk

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
fist you can um you have to get the disk
in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> staff<00:01:25.170> parts<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.650> though<00:01:25.799> those<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
in the staff parts as though those and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.070 
in the staff parts as though those and
then<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> challenges<00:01:27.900> and

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.559 
because I'm sorry the zombies team is
kind<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.280> subpar<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.870> while<00:03:41.139> I<00:03:41.530> mean

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
kind of a subpar for a while I mean

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.240 
kind of a subpar for a while I mean
their<00:03:43.569> maps<00:03:43.780> have<00:03:43.989> been<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.349> know<00:03:44.470> mediocre

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
their maps have been you know mediocre

their maps have been you know mediocre
they<00:03:45.669> haven't<00:03:45.880> really<00:03:46.030> made<00:03:46.120> any<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:47.109> know

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
they haven't really made any you know

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.210 
they haven't really made any you know
rememberable<00:03:48.430> classic<00:03:48.970> maps<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.560> mean<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.859> think

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
rememberable classic maps I mean I think

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.409 
rememberable classic maps I mean I think
everyone<00:03:51.609> agree<00:03:51.849> with<00:03:51.940> me<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.150> they

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
everyone agree with me on that they

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.030 
everyone agree with me on that they
wouldn't<00:03:52.630> say<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.900> dire<00:03:53.200> eyes<00:03:53.440> are<00:03:53.650> buried

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
wouldn't say the dire eyes are buried

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.900 
wouldn't say the dire eyes are buried
our<00:03:54.579> classic<00:03:55.180> maps<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:57.609> what<00:03:57.730> makes

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
those maps not classic are the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.699 
those maps not classic are the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
but it's not it's not really kind of

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.540 
but it's not it's not really kind of
boring<00:04:22.719> and<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.830> character<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.370> the

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
boring and the character is the

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:26.189 
characters kind of make the maps

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.429 
characters kind of make the maps
the<00:04:27.189> new<00:04:27.340> crew<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:28.509> didn't<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.139> it

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439
