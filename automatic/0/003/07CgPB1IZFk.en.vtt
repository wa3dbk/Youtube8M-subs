00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.610
 today we make a healthy salad 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.610
 cunts 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.639
 let's cut the lettuce into strips very 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.850
 fine and the best way to do it is to 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 this way 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.890
 enrique is happening to me and I will go 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.200
 riding on a tray we will try 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.300
 get a good presentation because 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.290
 the food not only enters through the mouth but 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.290
 also by sight 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.350
 we go with the chives that we are going to 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.010
 cut into elongated strips 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.010
 We cut from one side 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:07.119
 and now of the other we put them in the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.009
 tray now let's go with the tomato that 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.009
 we will cut into small squares 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.510
 we put them in the tray 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.159
 We cut in half the avocado 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.670
 this is the best way to get the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.689
 bone without breaking the avocado now what 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.689
 cut into strips 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 and also in squares 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.969
 I put the strips and the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969
 small squares of the middle 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.420
 the time has come to present the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.849
 king of the party the corks 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.340
 also known as tarwi or 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.489
 lupins and they are responsible for presiding 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 center of the tray here we leave you the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.170
 recipe of what we do 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.209
 homemade now let's set up a plate and 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.100
 this is what we have come to see 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.440
 what do you think if you have any 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.030
 suggestion tell us the like this all 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.850
 we will learn 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.280
 we place the chive around the hoop 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.280
 metallic below the lettuce 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.370
 surround with avocado strips 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.790
 and on top of the lettuce the avocado 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.790
 chopped 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.950
 and we fill the thick ring with the chochos 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.239
 we compensate on all sides so that 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 do not roll us from the center before 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.519
 start with the second layer 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.519
 ah 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.510
 and how the center of the target is red 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.790
 this will be the site reserved for the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.140
 tomato chochos and tomato have 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.420
 than being at the same height as the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.739
 lettuce so that when removing the rings 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.739
 fall on top of each other 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.210
 the time has come to cross our fingers 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.070
 perfect this nice target can be 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.020
 a good way for children to eat 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.690
 salads and it only remains to align it to 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.160
 taste and that's how it looks like we hope that 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.160
 you like it and health for all
