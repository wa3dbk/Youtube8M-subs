thread<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.510> onto<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.969> heavy<00:00:47.969> tool<00:00:48.270> from

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
thread them onto your heavy tool from

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.750 
thread them onto your heavy tool from
there<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.430> take<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.730> heavy<00:00:50.969> band

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
and you're gonna slide those beads

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.959 
and you're gonna slide those beads
directly<00:00:56.910> onto<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.600> heavy<00:00:57.809> band<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> you'll

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
directly onto the heavy band so you'll

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
directly onto the heavy band so you'll
have<00:01:00.120> something<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.840> there'll<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.199> two

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
have something like that there'll be two

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.310 
have something like that there'll be two
of<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.870> we're<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.140> do

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
of them and from there we're gonna do

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:29.830 
of them and from there we're gonna do
two<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> those

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.749 

all<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.799> now<00:01:31.890> we've<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.400> three<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
all right so now we've got all three of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.010 
all right so now we've got all three of
those<00:01:32.850> made<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> should<00:01:33.600> look<00:01:33.750> something

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
those made up it should look something

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.830 
those made up it should look something
like<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:37.100> what<00:01:38.100> we're<00:01:38.220> gonna<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:38.880> we're

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
like this what we're gonna do so we're

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
like this what we're gonna do so we're
going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> take<00:01:40.229> those<00:01:41.030> beads<00:01:42.920> stretch<00:01:43.920> them

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
going to take those beads stretch them

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.350 
going to take those beads stretch them
out<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.490> where<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.670> gives<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.210> bit

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
out to where it gives you a little bit

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
out to where it gives you a little bit
of<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.539> opening<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:49.280> let's<00:01:50.280> go

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
of an opening just like that let's go

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
of an opening just like that let's go
ahead<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> those<00:01:51.240> beads<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ahead and take one of those beads and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.960 
ahead and take one of those beads and
put<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> opening<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:56.490> should<00:01:56.729> look

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
put that in the opening it should look

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.230 
put that in the opening it should look
something<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> cross<00:01:59.240> from

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
something like that like a cross from

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.960 
something like that like a cross from
that<00:02:00.390> point<00:02:01.220> we're<00:02:02.220> gonna<00:02:02.280> stretch<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
that point we're gonna stretch these a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.230 
that point we're gonna stretch these a
little<00:02:03.240> bit<00:02:03.360> farther<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.909> slide

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
little bit farther so that we can slide

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.050 
little bit farther so that we can slide
those<00:02:06.569> top<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.319> beads<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.789> hole<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
those top two beads in that hole so it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.280 
those top two beads in that hole so it
almost<00:02:12.180> should<00:02:12.480> look<00:02:12.630> like<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.840> like<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
almost should look like that like a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.940 
almost should look like that like a
little<00:02:13.500> star<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.200> there<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.560> gonna<00:02:16.620> grab

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
little star and there we're gonna grab

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.660 
little star and there we're gonna grab
some<00:02:16.980> white<00:02:17.790> yarn<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.160> making<00:02:20.370> an

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
some white yarn and we are making an

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.160 
some white yarn and we are making an
eight<00:02:20.819> cluster<00:02:21.299> so<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.959> gonna

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
eight cluster so what this is gonna

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.650 
eight cluster so what this is gonna
represent<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:23.430> gonna<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> skein<00:02:24.239> on<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
represent it's gonna be the skein on the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
represent it's gonna be the skein on the
eggs<00:02:25.610> go<00:02:26.610> ahead<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.819> take<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.030> apart<00:02:30.680> slide

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
eggs go ahead and take that apart slide

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.440 
eggs go ahead and take that apart slide
that<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> tops<00:02:33.500> just<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.739> so

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
that on one of the tops just like so

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.140 
that on one of the tops just like so
flip<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.600> over

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.479 

do<00:02:42.690> exactly<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.349> same<00:02:43.380> thing<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.130> same

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
do exactly the same thing on that same

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.809 
do exactly the same thing on that same
on<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.030> other<00:02:45.150> side<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.430> looks<00:02:47.610> something

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
on the other side so it looks something

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.360 
on the other side so it looks something
like<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:50.420> from<00:02:51.420> there<00:02:51.980> we're<00:02:52.980> going<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.190> take

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
like that from there we're going to take

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.530 
like that from there we're going to take
these<00:02:53.550> beads<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.060> we're<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.330> start

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
these beads and we're going to start

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.990 
these beads and we're going to start
stretching<00:02:55.380> these<00:02:55.489> pulling<00:02:56.489> these<00:02:56.580> down<00:02:56.849> on

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
stretching these pulling these down on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.130 
stretching these pulling these down on
the<00:02:57.090> rubber<00:02:57.239> bands<00:02:59.599> make<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.720> pulling<00:03:01.050> them

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the rubber bands make the pulling them

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:21.230 
the rubber bands make the pulling them
really<00:03:01.440> nice<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.890> tight<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.310> snug

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.880 

so<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:21.900> gonna<00:03:22.020> look<00:03:22.170> something<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.650> just

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
so it's gonna look something like just

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.090 
so it's gonna look something like just
like<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:24.600> there<00:03:24.870> we're<00:03:25.620> gonna<00:03:25.710> cut<00:03:25.980> our
