now how to make one of the healthiest
shakes<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.450> could<00:00:06.600> make<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.990> just<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
shakes that you could make in just a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.440 
shakes that you could make in just a
couple<00:00:07.379> minutes<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:08.069> mean<00:00:08.610> meaning<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.120> takes

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
couple minutes I mean meaning just takes

couple minutes I mean meaning just takes
a<00:00:09.570> couple<00:00:09.599> minutes<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.230> make<00:00:10.410> first<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
a couple minutes to make first the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.020 
a couple minutes to make first the
simplest<00:00:11.820> version<00:00:12.860> that<00:00:13.860> i<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.639> has

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
simplest version that i can think of has

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.849 
simplest version that i can think of has
just<00:00:15.360> four<00:00:15.599> ingredients<00:00:15.750> there's<00:00:16.710> our

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
just four ingredients there's our

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.310 
just four ingredients there's our
protein<00:00:17.310> source<00:00:17.580> which<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.880> milk<00:00:18.300> or<00:00:18.600> soy<00:00:18.990> milk

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
protein source which is milk or soy milk

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
tablespoon of peanut butter is 100

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
tablespoon of peanut butter is 100
calories<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:53.039> perfect<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:54.149> I'm

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
calories that's perfect what I'm

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
calories that's perfect what I'm
actually<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.949> step

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
actually going to make now is one step

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.150 
actually going to make now is one step
up<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.570> personal<00:00:58.260> shake<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
up from that my personal shake with a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.349 
up from that my personal shake with a
few<00:00:59.489> extra<00:01:00.469> added<00:01:01.469> healthy<00:01:02.039> things<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.879> raises

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
few extra added healthy things it raises

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.070 
few extra added healthy things it raises
the<00:01:03.420> calories<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.559> 400<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> 600<00:01:06.450> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the calories from about 400 up to 600 so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.109 
the calories from about 400 up to 600 so
this<00:01:07.380> simpler<00:01:07.830> shake<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.640> drink<00:01:08.909> in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this simpler shake you would drink in

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.679 
this simpler shake you would drink in
two<00:01:10.020> sittings<00:01:10.409> half<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.610> shake<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.060> hour<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
two sittings half the shake an hour to a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690 
two sittings half the shake an hour to a
to<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> other<00:01:13.170> half<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.460> complicated

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to the other half this more complicated

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
to the other half this more complicated
one<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:15.689> 600<00:01:16.290> calories<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
one that's 600 calories you want that in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
one that's 600 calories you want that in
three<00:01:17.610> sittings<00:01:18.030> wait<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:18.960> least<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.290> hour

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
three sittings wait at least an hour

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.590 
three sittings wait at least an hour
between<00:01:20.070> drinking<00:01:20.729> every<00:01:21.150> third<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
between drinking every third of the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.990 
between drinking every third of the
shake<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:23.240> milk<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.450> soy<00:01:24.840> milk<00:01:26.000> 1

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
shake so here we go milk or soy milk 1

shake so here we go milk or soy milk 1
cup

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.890 

because<00:01:37.670> this<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.330> slightly<00:01:38.600> larger

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
because this is the slightly larger

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.770 
because this is the slightly larger
shape<00:01:39.350> I'm<00:01:39.650> going<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.950> go<00:01:40.100> with<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.780> heaping

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780
