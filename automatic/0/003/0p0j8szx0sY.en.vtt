00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 I want to configure it for you here. 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.280
 how do you go for you to do this 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.340
 same setting, remembering that it is not 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 just for motogp for any cell phone 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.920
 android you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.509
 after you have downloaded the new laut 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.830

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:43.289
 You downloaded and will set it there. 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:49.520
 You go on the desktop and go here. 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:54.539
 on axis v is made of scrolling looks 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.539
 Here're okay hub and daughters or no 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.569
 mine I put cube here 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.280
 it is thus generated the format of a 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:08.250
 cube like this one 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.130
 here is this configuration here 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.920
 the cube you're going to put 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.430
 on here 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.569
 and remembering that when you 're there new 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.319
 Latin 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.510
 it is automatically 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.060
 photo of your important wallpaper 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.430
 here's a cool thing to do 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.580
 I found hi 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.950
 it stands behind your application as 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.709
 screen background throughout the menu does not 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.970
 that black bar you having a 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.269
 diesel engine 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.060
 always has that black bar that is 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.739
 differentiating then in the value of tomato 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.450
 with the mind when you're there open 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.790
 she's already like this 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.760
 There you can put the wallpaper 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.269
 this function will already work 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.610
 here we go in the configuration how to put 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:05.790
 So where are you, on the desktop? 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:10.950
 set the cube there and you go here 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:16.299
 from the dragon 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:22.710
 here you will put what he asks 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:27.090
 transition animation animation 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.420
 You're going to stay here, have a circle. 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.370
 zoom in to arrange up 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.680
 mine is the circle click and I get this 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.650

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.390
 This is the configuration here. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.150
 was he to open here? 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:56.970
 You see how he stayed then this 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:00.660
 It's to do this here that you 're going to walk. 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.790
 in transition animation 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.480
 You choose the one who looks, I think it's better. 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.480

 horizontal 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.969

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.529
 rounded rectangle or arc that my 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:17.909
 movie platform if you choose 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.909

 You'll mark and show the line. 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.559
