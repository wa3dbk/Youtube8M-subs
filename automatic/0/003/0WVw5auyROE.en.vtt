does exist why was it built

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.200 
does exist why was it built
the<00:05:00.040> ancient<00:05:00.400> Chinese<00:05:00.460> did<00:05:00.940> not<00:05:01.030> have<00:05:01.180> a

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
much so what was the purpose of this

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.940 
much so what was the purpose of this
pyramid<00:05:10.570> you<00:05:10.780> know<00:05:10.900> what<00:05:11.080> maybe<00:05:11.380> pyramids

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
pyramid you know what maybe pyramids

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.920 
pyramid you know what maybe pyramids
were<00:05:12.070> not<00:05:12.310> meant<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.610> be<00:05:12.760> tombs<00:05:13.030> at<00:05:13.270> all<00:05:13.510> for

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
were not meant to be tombs at all for

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.690 
were not meant to be tombs at all for
example<00:05:14.320> when<00:05:14.440> Chinese<00:05:14.710> emperors<00:05:15.220> died<00:05:15.430> they

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
example when Chinese emperors died they

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.370

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
fake tombs all over the place so you

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.730 
fake tombs all over the place so you
can't<00:05:19.210> like<00:05:19.390> loot<00:05:19.720> or<00:05:19.930> tomb<00:05:20.110> building<00:05:20.620> a
