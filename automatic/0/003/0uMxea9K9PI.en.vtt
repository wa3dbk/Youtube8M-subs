00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.880
 e 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.099
 Russia and in ordinary 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.050
 First, let's figure it out 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.739
 all that 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.179
 these steps to the foundation or as we speak 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.130
 Russian turns 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.840
 high dynamic i images 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 will let 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.599
 make a similar forum 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.340
 usually one still 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.630
 camera 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.170
 but removes 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.379
 some 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.569
 in pictures with different meanings 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:41.900
 exposure 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.600
 i.e 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 we are with different shutter speeds and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.660
 aperture 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.830
 from light to dark after which all shots 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 overlap each other 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.790
 and it turns out that the first place 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.310
 at imposing 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.180
 furniture comes out with a ball 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 Budyen have a place clearly visible in 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 overall such a bright counterattack 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.619
 since we don't have several 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.930
 images from various 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 frame light intensity 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.150
 I'll try to do it 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.500
 these ideas are right photos 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 See if he sees daily 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 of images 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.260
 This of course in rut you what the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.540
 This is Britain's deception 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.580
 i air and foul it 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.530
 this segment of the meeting 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 let it be called caicedo 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560
 but nonetheless 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 what we have 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 Here we have the original image 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 I made this photo in the mountains 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.540
 lately certain 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.649
 manipulations 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.299
 because he 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.459
 we get here such as 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.459
 she is more contrasted more traced 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.879
 let it be called 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.269
 all this I come 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.400
 who is she 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.399
 much better 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.399
 source 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.259
 m 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.609
 first thing 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.459
 create 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.459
 new layer background images 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.689
 it can deal now a few 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.299
 by either 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.969
 simple pulling on 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.539
 icon 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.749
 naumov 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.559
 of course we did something 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.099
 got a statuette 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.389
 copy fund 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 mean adjustments barcelona 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.899
 function 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.369
 i'm not holy 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.529
 set the values 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.529
 experimentally achieved 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.499
 in the general range of 50 percent effect neither 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.499
 no money shortage 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.380
 we made it 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.380
 here is such 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.939
 background image 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.749
 next step 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.709
 we make them 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.029
 fit rub 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.139
 copy background image we get 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.139
 one more 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.909
 we correct it 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.259
 applying an ounce and we really do 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.340
 image correction 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.340
 provided 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:35.830
 we get 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.279
 black and white image 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.590
 black and white copy 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.499
 apply 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.499
 pond to this layer properties are hard light 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.330
 that's what we did 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.400
 which tass 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.740
 sort of like contrast 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.240
 high china 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 smoke here 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.740
 reason to talk 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.270
 what are we doing 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.800
 doing 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.749
 another copy 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.659
 original 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.659
 and give them its very top 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.860
 score this layer 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 from the blur group a broken glass 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.900
 also by experience I sought means prices 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.919
 in the suburbs from his limit of 30 and his family 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.580
 of since pixels 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.839
 but so that we could see the outlines 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.839
 pictures that this is what we get 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.449
 on your blog 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.519
 it turned out it turned out like this 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.519
 we had such a blurry 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.189
 I give them vols 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.189
 so it was tight 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.699
 inscription 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.919
 and that's basically 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.689
 we practically 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.430
 ready our 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.010
 night ahead 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.010
 all these assets 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:25.889
 I think what's the matter 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.889
 Maikop Rudin 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.150
 3 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.330
 upper layer 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.210
 group 1 is obtained and with the result module 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.210
 Here we have the initial formidable 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.009
 could i want to say 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.050
 someone will say that it does not cross the era 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.339
 Photo 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:56.180
 start will be a penny 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.479
 but nevertheless we have achieved improvement 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.949
 better contrast quality 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.509
 policy drawing 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.830
 specialty photography 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.139
 generally 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.990
 I have the result of the contract 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.479
 all the best 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:12.279
 Thanks for attention
