00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.850 

I<00:00:35.480> think<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.720> really<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.560> when

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I think what we really want to do when

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.980

of off material innovation and coming up

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.530 
of off material innovation and coming up
with<00:01:02.220> new<00:01:02.930> manufacturing<00:01:03.930> methods<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:05.010> use

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
with new manufacturing methods we use

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
with new manufacturing methods we use

on<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.820> metal<00:01:09.479> surface<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> does

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
on this metal surface and what this does

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.050 
on this metal surface and what this does
is<00:01:11.610> create<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:11.940> nano<00:01:12.660> matrix<00:01:13.229> structure<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
is create a nano matrix structure I

is create a nano matrix structure I
think<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.149> beauty<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.780> happens<00:01:16.200> where

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
think the beauty really happens where

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
think the beauty really happens where
engineering<00:01:16.920> design<00:01:17.190> comes<00:01:17.460> together<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
engineering design comes together and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.389 
engineering design comes together and
they<00:01:18.180> work<00:01:18.390> seamlessly<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.830> close<00:01:20.130> together

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
they work seamlessly and close together

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.950 
they work seamlessly and close together
take<00:01:21.360> risk<00:01:21.660> be<00:01:22.200> bold<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:23.509> really<00:01:24.509> tried<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
take risk be bold and really tried to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.969 
take risk be bold and really tried to
come<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.259> something<00:01:25.680> new<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
come up with something new and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
come up with something new and
innovative<00:01:26.160> we<00:01:26.729> created<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.330> CNC<00:01:28.170> process

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
innovative we created the CNC process

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.770 
innovative we created the CNC process
using<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> special<00:01:29.430> ball<00:01:29.670> cutter<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.660> we

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
using a special ball cutter that we

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.719 
using a special ball cutter that we
designed<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.590> create<00:01:31.800> this<00:01:31.979> natural<00:01:32.460> curve

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
designed to create this natural curve

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.150 
designed to create this natural curve
that<00:01:33.180> fits<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> palm<00:01:33.660> your<00:01:33.990> hand<00:01:34.170> um<00:01:34.860> what

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
that fits in the palm your hand um what

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.219 
that fits in the palm your hand um what
we're<00:01:35.280> trying<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.580> do<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.940> have<00:01:36.840> nothing<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
we're trying to do is have nothing that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
we're trying to do is have nothing that
distracts<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.950> there's<00:01:38.610> no<00:01:38.850> part<00:01:39.179> break

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
distracts you there's no part break

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.749 
distracts you there's no part break
there<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.690> no<00:01:39.840> gap<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.830> don't<00:01:41.009> even<00:01:41.130> pick<00:01:41.250> up

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
there is no gap you don't even pick up

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
there is no gap you don't even pick up
where<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.179> parts<00:01:42.450> come<00:01:42.630> together<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.259> what

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
where the parts come together and what

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
where the parts come together and what
we<00:01:44.039> use<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.550> special<00:01:45.149> diamond<00:01:45.360> cutter<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
we use is a special diamond cutter to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
we use is a special diamond cutter to
create<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.039> chamfer<00:01:47.700> across<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.539> surface<00:01:48.780> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
create this chamfer across the surface I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.169 
create this chamfer across the surface I
think<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:49.979> ultimately<00:01:50.160> try<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.789> do<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
think what we ultimately try to do is

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.490 
think what we ultimately try to do is
create<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.569> very<00:01:51.810> simple<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> beautiful

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
create a very simple and beautiful

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.490 
create a very simple and beautiful
experience<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.759> user<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.140> word<00:01:55.319> this
