 forest for and poems hare 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.039
 so he looks like 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.470
 the case consists of two separate layers 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.940
 the first inner layer of soft 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.030
 silicone 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.590
 nice to touch 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.340
 layer is made with all 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.350

 the beginning of the cycle is placed 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.950
 Silicone layer to us unfortunately no dawn 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.170
 we do not therefore have to demonstrate 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.120

 nato is ready 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.240
 build quality is high 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.689
 which, in principle, is common to all 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.039
 port covers boxing 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
