00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.820
 and hi to all and all these benji and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 new video so that will focus on 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
 installing too many times as well 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 that its use 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.439
 so in my opinion the most used mode 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.599
 by the minecraft players 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.280
 so we'll start right away 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.740
 go go on the link that is in the 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.750
 description or any month on a page 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.620
 like this one you wait 5 seconds 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.630
 that this banner bound is showing that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.420
 I bugged so you pass 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.690
 the herald 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 then you download this file 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.519
 here we wait until it's done 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.190
 Once you're done, we'll do it 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.780
 leave there for now 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.449
 then you have your launcher 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.979
 Minecraft 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.649
 so I did not specify but on 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.440
 1.6.2 the current version but that 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.080
 should work for all versions 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.500
 with the new launcher so you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.500
 make new profile call this one 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080
 Oh 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.690
 like 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.570
 at one point 6.2 your friends and for 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.550
 the moment if you want to go in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.430
 your destination folder for 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.270
 minecraft you can copy paste this 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.050
 this link but I prefer to do 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.240
 windows r so you do safe profile 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.240
 for now you close the launcher 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.500
 so i'm going to make windows r you enter 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.610
 % a ppda per cent percent then you 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.380
 go into minecraft version and you 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.350
 go make a new folder that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 is 1.6.2 your friends so in this 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.840
 dom 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:12.160
 1.6.2 tm ea you to copy them both 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.500
 two files that are in the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.780
 folder 1.632 so the version on 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.970
 which you are currently playing 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.500
 so these two wanted to copy and you 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.340
 put them in a corner his care of 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.190
 themis so once it's done you 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.050
 rename the two so you just have 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:36.220
 added temi normally to the name tm 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.590
 So here is the java file or 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.959
 so maybe it's a winrar icon 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.690
 where show off it depends so you do 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.360
 open with winrar because I have 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.130
 winrar but it works with two things 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.330
 you delete well but taaf and 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.709
 I insist on that because I have 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.610
 a lot of people who tell me that 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.459
 not walk and ben already deleted but taf 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.140
 you will see it will work maybe we 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.220
 so then you in real you open the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.830
 folder too many times 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.520
 no, that's not it 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.190
 I wanted that's it so here in this 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.350
 folder everything mini temse you 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.990
 select everything so check one and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.560
 you slip drop in the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.810
 16.2 your friends point kind that's it 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.480
 simple and we have one last little 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.180
 thing to do is in this one so 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.250
 it's a gizo point file not play 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.640
 too much how is it said so you 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.680
 open it with either notepad or 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.670
 blocks our hungry editor files from 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.630
 texts and in ideas here you go 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.010
 add in between what is between 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.260
 in quotation marks tm ea so you do 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.830
 in 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.920
 that's normally you should have 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.340
 the version what you just created 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.920
 a new version in quotation marks 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.610
 huh it's just henry who added the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.709
 so in profile mode you select 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.190
 1.6.2 tmi I do not know if I have 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.030
 says 1.6.1 or 1.6 x 2 it does not matter 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.019
 so you do 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.049
 edit profile and in use version you 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.870
 select the tm and this is it 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.350
 version that you created a moment 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.330
 so you enter your credentials 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.270
 so ben jeddi 14 and my password 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:36.360
 down I tell you not at the end I you 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.720
 enter the game it starts 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:46.340
 normally that's it then you go 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.340
 in a solo part no matter 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.460
 good evening 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.460
 generate a little normal 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.930
 so here I am on the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.430
 so I changed software from 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.340
 the recording and I changed hands 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.050
 because the poor luce also generate 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.400
 so well that's just a note that I have 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.470
 started like that no I have not got it yet 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.210
 completely finished and Castle species 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.210
 I show it to you quickly 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.389
 so the entrance is through the window in 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.279
 does it's rather an output even so 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.849
 that's the way it looks like that but we 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.709
 is not there for that we are here for this 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.219
 so for the case at bass and the touch 

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:31.309
 next to the bed and next to the lp 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:34.659
 for what its end so here you have 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:38.419
 all your items end all items in the game 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:43.560
 possible and imaginable head of 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:46.230
 skeletons here so there are some 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.500
 so improbable too but it 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.570
 is still one of the items 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.360
 firework all that all that 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:59.160
 you have always dreamed you have the 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.040
 possibility also two all deleted in 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.770
 pressing mage and garbage cans that's 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.350
 removes everything you can create yourself 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.780
 scenes like that you make a save up 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.919
 and if you want your potions you 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.680
 click on the save 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.410
 you can do without survival 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.830
 creative still has in ink collage 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.830
 hasty 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:29.200
 hop here I can fly then you 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:34.720
 can put the rain or not 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:41.050
 so that's the rain the day the 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:43.330
 midday midnight the difficulty is 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.130
 this enough to fill your life and your 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.510
 edge of plugs so you have the 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.300
 possibility also to make potions 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.210
 you can discover everything 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.800
 this by exploring this month of May that is 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:02.050
 quite useful and well thought I find 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.500
