anything that isn't really there the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.429 
anything that isn't really there the
only<00:01:26.880> con<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.659> would<00:01:27.810> say<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.290> this

only con I would say about this

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
concealer is that it's in a squeeze tube

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
concealer is that it's in a squeeze tube
not<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.960> least<00:01:31.259> favorite<00:01:31.650> thing<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> world
