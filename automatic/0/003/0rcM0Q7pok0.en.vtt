you're<00:02:38.420> gonna<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.840> change<00:02:39.110> up<00:02:39.380> your

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
you're gonna have to change up your

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.440 
you're gonna have to change up your
playstyle<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.280> bit<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.120> kind<00:02:41.390> of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
playstyle a bit and that kind of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.300 
playstyle a bit and that kind of
detracts<00:02:41.900> from<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.200> overall<00:02:42.320> shotgun

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
detracts from the overall shotgun

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.760 
detracts from the overall shotgun
experience<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.060> my<00:02:44.240> opinion<00:02:44.780> because<00:02:44.960> if<00:02:45.620> you

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
experience in my opinion because if you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.590 
experience in my opinion because if you
can't<00:02:46.040> kill<00:02:46.250> somebody<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.790> one<00:02:47.030> shot<00:02:47.360> then

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
can't kill somebody in one shot then

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.210 
can't kill somebody in one shot then
you're<00:02:47.720> putting<00:02:47.900> yourself<00:02:48.320> at<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.500> pretty<00:02:48.890> big

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
you're putting yourself at a pretty big

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.010 
you're putting yourself at a pretty big

off and if you can't kill them by the

your shots to kill or your time to kill

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.080 
your shots to kill or your time to kill
rather<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.440> pretty<00:03:06.950> much<00:03:07.160> determined<00:03:07.790> by<00:03:07.910> your

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
rather is pretty much determined by your

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.180 
rather is pretty much determined by your
distance<00:03:08.540> from<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.990> target<00:03:09.230> shotguns<00:03:09.950> don't

distance from the target shotguns don't

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.710

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.990 
get any sort of bonus damage for
headshots<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.710> generally<00:03:13.250> speaking<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.820> want

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
headshots so generally speaking you want

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.270 
headshots so generally speaking you want
to<00:03:14.090> go<00:03:14.210> for<00:03:14.450> body<00:03:14.720> shots<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.590> also<00:03:15.710> puts<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.190> at

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
to go for body shots it also puts you at

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.220 
to go for body shots it also puts you at
a<00:03:16.340> huge<00:03:16.580> disadvantage<00:03:17.060> if<00:03:17.540> somebody<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:17.990> head

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
a huge disadvantage if somebody is head

I'm aiming down sights for a lot of my
kills<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:58.550> that's<00:03:58.760> because<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.180> feel<00:03:59.990> like

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
kills here that's because I feel like

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.020 
kills here that's because I feel like
there's<00:04:00.650> something<00:04:00.860> wrong<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:01.430> hip<00:04:01.640> fire<00:04:01.850> on

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
there's something wrong with hip fire on

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.060 
there's something wrong with hip fire on
shotguns<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.720> battlefield<00:04:03.230> 4<00:04:03.350> there's<00:04:03.830> just

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
shotguns in battlefield 4 there's just

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.160 
shotguns in battlefield 4 there's just
something<00:04:04.400> off<00:04:04.550> about<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.240> end<00:04:05.750> up<00:04:05.900> missing

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
something off about it I end up missing

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.230 
something off about it I end up missing
so<00:04:06.680> many<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:07.070> my<00:04:07.100> shots<00:04:07.490> when<00:04:07.700> shooting<00:04:07.940> from

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
so many of my shots when shooting from

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.790 
so many of my shots when shooting from
the<00:04:08.360> hip<00:04:08.480> even<00:04:08.960> though<00:04:09.110> my<00:04:09.290> little<00:04:09.560> circle

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
the hip even though my little circle

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.490 
the hip even though my little circle
reticle<00:04:10.459> is<00:04:10.820> usually<00:04:11.390> on<00:04:11.570> my<00:04:11.780> target<00:04:12.110> so

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
reticle is usually on my target so

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.730 
reticle is usually on my target so
basically<00:04:13.040> ABS<00:04:14.030> whenever<00:04:14.630> possible<00:04:14.990> even

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
basically ABS whenever possible even

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.840 
basically ABS whenever possible even
though<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:15.950> seems<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.340> little<00:04:16.580> bit

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
though it seems a little bit

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.000 
though it seems a little bit
counterintuitive<00:04:17.260> just<00:04:18.260> by<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.470> nature<00:04:18.980> of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
counterintuitive just by the nature of

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.500 
counterintuitive just by the nature of
the<00:04:19.220> shotgun<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:19.850> kind<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.090> want<00:04:20.270> to<00:04:20.330> run

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the shotgun you kind of want to run

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.210 
the shotgun you kind of want to run
around<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.989> be<00:04:21.140> fast<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.680> shoot<00:04:21.919> from<00:04:22.070> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
around and be fast and shoot from the

around and be fast and shoot from the
hip<00:04:22.250> in<00:04:22.820> close<00:04:23.090> quarters<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:23.870> not<00:04:24.320> really<00:04:24.620> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
hip in close quarters but not really the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.390 
hip in close quarters but not really the
way<00:04:24.950> that<00:04:25.160> I'm<00:04:25.280> playing<00:04:25.640> with<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.910> now

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
way that I'm playing with it now

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.310 
way that I'm playing with it now
talk<00:04:26.610> about<00:04:26.759> my<00:04:27.000> preferred<00:04:27.449> loadout<00:04:27.990> for<00:04:28.020> the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
talk about my preferred loadout for the

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.390 
talk about my preferred loadout for the
m1014

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
m1014

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.670 
m1014
I<00:04:29.550> like<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.030> run<00:04:30.300> an<00:04:30.509> Ergo<00:04:31.080> grip<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
I like to run an Ergo grip on the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.590 
I like to run an Ergo grip on the
shotgun<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.190> kind<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.430> helps<00:04:32.729> your<00:04:32.910> accuracy

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
shotgun it kind of helps your accuracy

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.439 
shotgun it kind of helps your accuracy
while<00:04:34.020> moving<00:04:34.350> around<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:35.070> also<00:04:35.430> like<00:04:35.789> to<00:04:35.970> use<00:04:36.240> a

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
while moving around I also like to use a

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.110 
while moving around I also like to use a
modified<00:04:37.199> choke<00:04:37.590> full<00:04:37.979> choke<00:04:38.220> will<00:04:38.490> generally

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
modified choke full choke will generally

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.670 
modified choke full choke will generally
tighten<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.539> spread<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.840> little<00:04:40.050> bit<00:04:40.199> too<00:04:40.530> much

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
tighten the spread a little bit too much

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.249 
tighten the spread a little bit too much
and<00:04:40.979> give<00:04:41.400> me<00:04:41.550> very<00:04:42.060> little<00:04:42.449> leeway<00:04:42.690> with<00:04:43.050> my

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
and give me very little leeway with my

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.409 
and give me very little leeway with my
accuracy<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.340> miss<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> shot<00:04:44.880> ever<00:04:45.150> so

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
accuracy so if I miss a shot ever so

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.629 
accuracy so if I miss a shot ever so
slightly<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:46.080> basically<00:04:46.560> don't<00:04:46.830> get<00:04:47.039> any<00:04:47.280> hit

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
slightly I basically don't get any hit

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.909 
slightly I basically don't get any hit
markers<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.240> modified<00:04:49.080> choke<00:04:49.320> seems<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> work

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
markers so modified choke seems to work

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.969 
markers so modified choke seems to work
best<00:04:50.160> for<00:04:50.370> me<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:50.669> am<00:04:51.180> using<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.780> Kobra<00:04:52.229> red<00:04:52.680> dot

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
best for me I am using the Kobra red dot

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.740 
best for me I am using the Kobra red dot
sight<00:04:53.280> as<00:04:53.430> much<00:04:53.610> as<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:53.910> would<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.419> use<00:04:54.570> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
sight as much as I would like to use the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.629 
sight as much as I would like to use the
iron<00:04:55.050> sights<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.530> as<00:04:55.650> much<00:04:55.830> as<00:04:55.889> I<00:04:56.130> do<00:04:56.190> with

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
iron sights and as much as I do with

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.029 
iron sights and as much as I do with
other<00:04:56.850> shotguns<00:04:57.300> like<00:04:57.810> say<00:04:58.050> this<00:04:58.229> past<00:04:58.440> 12<00:04:58.800> or

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
the guys coming in to basically destroy

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.270 
the guys coming in to basically destroy
us<00:05:48.990> in<00:05:49.169> our<00:05:49.289> spawn<00:05:49.590> or<00:05:49.740> something<00:05:50.070> like<00:05:50.220> that

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
us in our spawn or something like that

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.719 
us in our spawn or something like that
but<00:05:50.909> the<00:05:51.060> m1014<00:05:51.419> has<00:05:52.050> so<00:05:52.380> few<00:05:52.949> options<00:05:53.250> you

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
but the m1014 has so few options you

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.430 
but the m1014 has so few options you
don't<00:05:53.820> have<00:05:54.030> any<00:05:54.330> range<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.960> deal<00:05:55.139> with<00:05:55.289> guys

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
don't have any range to deal with guys

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.290 
don't have any range to deal with guys
at<00:05:55.650> range<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.310> if<00:05:56.430> you're<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:56.729> wrong<00:05:57.060> map

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
at range so if you're on the wrong map

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300 
at range so if you're on the wrong map
or<00:05:57.510> you<00:05:57.539> spawn<00:05:57.900> in<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.169> wrong<00:05:58.380> location<00:05:58.590> where

or you spawn in the wrong location where
you<00:05:59.490> just<00:05:59.669> don't<00:05:59.880> have<00:06:00.060> any<00:06:00.300> CQB<00:06:00.930> action

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
you just don't have any CQB action

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.110 
you just don't have any CQB action
available<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:02.070> you<00:06:02.159> at<00:06:02.370> least<00:06:02.580> readily

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
available to you at least readily

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.240 
available to you at least readily
available<00:06:03.240> then<00:06:04.139> you're<00:06:04.349> just<00:06:04.530> screwed<00:06:04.979> and

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
it really comes in situations where

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.680 
it really comes in situations where
there's<00:06:08.400> spawn<00:06:08.699> camping<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.389> that<00:06:09.479> just
