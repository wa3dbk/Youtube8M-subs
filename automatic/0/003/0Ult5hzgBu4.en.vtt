00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.090 

okay<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:01.740> here<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.790> my<00:00:03.270> home<00:00:04.080> brewing<00:00:04.589> setup

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
okay so here is my home brewing setup

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.040 
okay so here is my home brewing setup
for<00:00:05.690> brewing<00:00:06.690> five<00:00:06.930> gallons<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.649> beer<00:00:08.280> and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
for brewing five gallons of beer and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.730 
for brewing five gallons of beer and
it's<00:00:10.050> I'm<00:00:10.620> using<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.130> fly<00:00:11.610> sparging<00:00:12.240> technique

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
it's I'm using a fly sparging technique

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.980 
it's I'm using a fly sparging technique
which<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:14.969> first<00:00:15.240> time<00:00:15.450> doing<00:00:15.630> so

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
which is my first time doing so

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.480 
which is my first time doing so
hopefully<00:00:16.230> everything<00:00:16.680> works<00:00:16.770> out<00:00:16.980> up<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.460> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
hopefully everything works out up here I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
hopefully everything works out up here I
have<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.970> sparge<00:00:18.390> water<00:00:18.449> at<00:00:18.900> 170<00:00:19.529> degrees<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
have my sparge water at 170 degrees and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.759 
have my sparge water at 170 degrees and
then<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> ball<00:00:21.510> valve<00:00:21.539> opening<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
then I have a ball valve opening up to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.910 
then I have a ball valve opening up to
this<00:00:23.449> contraption<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.720> made<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.109> PVC

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
this contraption that I made of PVC

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.330 
this contraption that I made of PVC
piping<00:00:26.400> half-inch<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:28.380> drilled<00:00:28.650> holes<00:00:28.920> on

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
piping half-inch I just drilled holes on

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.299 
piping half-inch I just drilled holes on
the<00:00:29.580> bottom<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.000> each<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.420> those<00:00:30.510> arms<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
the bottom of each one of those arms and

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
the bottom of each one of those arms and
it's<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> disperse<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.930> sparge<00:00:34.260> water

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it's going to disperse the sparge water

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
it's going to disperse the sparge water
into<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.010> wort

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
into my wort

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
into my wort
evenly<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:39.350> valve<00:00:40.350> going

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
evenly and then I have a valve going

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.510 
evenly and then I have a valve going
down<00:00:41.010> into<00:00:41.460> my<00:00:41.640> work<00:00:41.940> kettle<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.649> basically<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
down into my work kettle so basically I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
down into my work kettle so basically I
guess<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> whole<00:00:45.000> idea<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> fly<00:00:45.690> sparging<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
guess the whole idea of fly sparging is

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.900 
guess the whole idea of fly sparging is
to<00:00:46.890> keep<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> same<00:00:47.760> amount<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.390> water<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
to keep the same amount of water in the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.959 
to keep the same amount of water in the
mash<00:00:50.910> tun<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.510> you're<00:00:52.199> draining<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.460> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
mash tun as you're draining into your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
mash tun as you're draining into your
work<00:00:54.180> kettle<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:55.590> greens<00:00:55.770> don't

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
work kettle so that your greens don't

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.590 
work kettle so that your greens don't
get<00:00:56.100> smashed<00:00:56.370> down<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> bottom<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
get smashed down to the bottom and that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.619 
get smashed down to the bottom and that
your<00:00:57.780> sugars<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> have<00:01:00.359> water

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
your sugars all have the have water

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
your sugars all have the have water
displacement<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.320> around<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
displacement all around them so you can

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
displacement all around them so you can
get<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> most<00:01:03.090> sugar<00:01:03.449> out<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.019> Mack<00:01:04.860> out

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
get the most sugar out of your Mack out

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.260 
get the most sugar out of your Mack out
of<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.369> greens<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:08.180> going<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
of your greens so here we go going to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.260 
of your greens so here we go going to
open<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> valve<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.799> see

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
open up the valve and as you can see

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.350 
open up the valve and as you can see
it's<00:01:15.270> trickling<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's trickling in and now I'm going to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.810 
it's trickling in and now I'm going to
open<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:19.909> bottom<00:01:20.909> valve<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.600> tested<00:01:22.140> earlier

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
open my bottom valve I tested earlier

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.130 
open my bottom valve I tested earlier
this<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.180> where<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> valve<00:01:24.689> needs<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
this is about where the valve needs to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.880 
this is about where the valve needs to
be<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.530> order<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.580> water<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.259> enter<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
be in order for the water to enter the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
be in order for the water to enter the
kettle<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.820> same<00:01:30.030> amount<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.540> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
kettle at the same amount as it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.370 
kettle at the same amount as it's
exiting<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> basically<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
exiting so this is basically for a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
exiting so this is basically for a
grapefruit<00:01:37.380> IPA<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.979> I'm<00:01:38.310> doing<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.000> it's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
grapefruit IPA that I'm doing that it's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
grapefruit IPA that I'm doing that it's
kind<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> an<00:01:39.900> experimental<00:01:40.350> thing<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.950> didn't

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
kind of an experimental thing I didn't

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.310 
kind of an experimental thing I didn't
find<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.490> recipes<00:01:41.850> online<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.659> using<00:01:42.990> actual

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
find any recipes online for using actual

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
find any recipes online for using actual
grapefruit<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
grapefruit but I'm going to go for it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.270 
grapefruit but I'm going to go for it
there's<00:01:46.140> some<00:01:46.259> grapefruit<00:01:46.470> there's<00:01:47.009> some

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
there's some grapefruit there's some

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.100 
there's some grapefruit there's some
juice<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.549> poured<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.360> I'm<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> use

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
juice that poured out I'm going to use

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
juice that poured out I'm going to use
some<00:01:49.229> simcoe's<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.310> bittering<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.090> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
some simcoe's for bittering and then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.859 
some simcoe's for bittering and then
some<00:01:51.600> Chinooks<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:53.299> flavoring<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> I'm

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
some Chinooks for flavoring and I'm

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.630 
some Chinooks for flavoring and I'm
going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> finish<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.439> some<00:01:55.500> 7seas<00:01:56.310> which

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
going to finish with some 7seas which

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
going to finish with some 7seas which
I'm<00:01:56.880> using<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> first<00:01:57.390> time<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I'm using for the first time as well and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'm using for the first time as well and
then<00:01:59.130> I'll<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.670> some<00:01:59.820> honey<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:00.479> syrup

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then I'll put some honey and some syrup

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.100 
then I'll put some honey and some syrup
in<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> counter<00:02:03.060> balance<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
in to kind of a counter balance the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.559 
in to kind of a counter balance the
grapefruit<00:02:04.950> sourness<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:07.819> then<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.849> come<00:02:09.390> over

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
grapefruit sourness and then I come over

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.920 
grapefruit sourness and then I come over
to<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.819> station<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.270> where<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.690> my

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
to my station here where I have my

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.490 
to my station here where I have my
immersion

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
immersion
