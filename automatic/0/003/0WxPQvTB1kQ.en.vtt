you<00:00:05.050> guys<00:00:05.260> got<00:00:06.040> a<00:00:06.070> rapid-fire<00:00:06.850> tnt<00:00:07.720> cannon<00:00:07.750> for

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
you guys got a rapid-fire tnt cannon for

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:26.089 
you guys got a rapid-fire tnt cannon for
you<00:00:09.030> see<00:00:10.030> if<00:00:10.180> it<00:00:10.269> works

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.769 

not<00:00:27.099> too<00:00:27.310> shabby<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:30.150> show<00:00:31.150> you<00:00:31.210> how<00:00:31.420> it<00:00:31.570> works

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
not too shabby it show you how it works

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.799 
not too shabby it show you how it works
let's<00:00:32.320> load<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.619> up<00:00:32.860> first<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.400> all<00:00:36.629> click<00:00:37.629> all

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
let's load it up first of all click all

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.100 
let's load it up first of all click all
the<00:00:37.840> gravel<00:00:38.170> out<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:39.239> didn't<00:00:40.239> put<00:00:41.019> enough

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
the gravel out I didn't put enough

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.229 
the gravel out I didn't put enough
gravel<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:41.830> there<00:00:42.040> that's<00:00:42.220> why<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.400> last<00:00:42.670> TNT

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
gravel in there that's why the last TNT

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.259 
gravel in there that's why the last TNT
didn't<00:00:43.540> go<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.280> fix<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.470> just<00:00:47.470> load<00:00:47.739> up<00:00:47.769> this

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
didn't go so fix that just load up this

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.439 
didn't go so fix that just load up this
line<00:00:49.269> with<00:00:49.570> teen<00:00:49.839> tea<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.970> then<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.120> stack<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
line with teen tea and then you stack a

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.630 
line with teen tea and then you stack a
bunch<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.900> gravel<00:00:53.350> on<00:00:53.530> top<00:00:53.559> of<00:00:53.979> the<00:00:54.040> last<00:00:54.280> one

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
bunch of gravel on top of the last one

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.140 
bunch of gravel on top of the last one
the<00:00:54.970> gravel<00:00:55.330> falls<00:00:55.839> down<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.549> all<00:00:57.549> that<00:00:57.850> is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
the gravel falls down and all that is

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.200 
the gravel falls down and all that is
able<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.540> push<00:00:59.729> the<00:01:00.729> T&amp;T<00:01:01.449> forward<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.760> what

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
able to push the T&amp;T forward so what

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.180 
able to push the T&amp;T forward so what
happens<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.839> we<00:01:05.049> got<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> 5<00:01:05.560> clock<00:01:05.860> running

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
happens is we got the 5 clock running

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.250 
happens is we got the 5 clock running
back<00:01:06.400> there<00:01:06.670> with<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.880> little<00:01:07.510> bit<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.659> delay<00:01:07.990> it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
back there with a little bit of delay it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.980 
back there with a little bit of delay it
slowed<00:01:08.590> down<00:01:08.799> I<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:10.750> know<00:01:10.810> what<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.570> five

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
slowed down I don't know what so five

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
slowed down I don't know what so five
six<00:01:14.650> seven<00:01:14.920> eight<00:01:15.250> nine<00:01:15.659> o'clock<00:01:16.659> whatever

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
six seven eight nine o'clock whatever

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.969 
six seven eight nine o'clock whatever
it's<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.909> slow<00:01:19.119> clock<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:20.259> has<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.409> land<00:01:20.740> gate

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
it's a slow clock and it has a land gate

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.889 
it's a slow clock and it has a land gate
thingy<00:01:21.310> here<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:23.320> side<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.820> goes<00:01:25.689> over

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
thingy here this side this goes over

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.010 
thingy here this side this goes over
here<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.670> torch<00:01:27.939> comes<00:01:28.149> on<00:01:28.329> it<00:01:28.539> activates

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
here this torch comes on it activates

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.010 
here this torch comes on it activates
the<00:01:29.200> TNT<00:01:29.679> allowing<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.460> be<00:01:30.700> pushed<00:01:31.210> by<00:01:31.750> this

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
the TNT allowing it to be pushed by this

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.069 
the TNT allowing it to be pushed by this
piston<00:01:32.530> into<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:34.409> firing<00:01:35.409> mechanism<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.420> in

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
piston into the firing mechanism and in

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.300 
piston into the firing mechanism and in
the<00:01:38.170> firing<00:01:38.380> mechanism<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.070> we're<00:01:39.189> here

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the firing mechanism so we're here

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.849 
the firing mechanism so we're here
delayed<00:01:39.700> slightly<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:41.289> shoots<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.740> off

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
delayed slightly and that shoots it off

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.539 
delayed slightly and that shoots it off
and<00:01:42.280> then<00:01:42.450> after<00:01:43.450> all<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.630> happens<00:01:44.549> this

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
and then after all that happens this

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.550 
and then after all that happens this
comes<00:01:45.759> down<00:01:45.939> here<00:01:46.179> this<00:01:46.329> is<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.560> little

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
comes down here this is a little

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.459 
comes down here this is a little
monostable<00:01:48.009> circuit<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.729> put<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.749> short<00:01:50.079> pulse

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
monostable circuit to put a short pulse

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.340 
monostable circuit to put a short pulse
into<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:51.240> piston<00:01:52.240> otherwise<00:01:52.659> you'll<00:01:53.049> lose<00:01:53.170> a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
into this piston otherwise you'll lose a

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.429 
into this piston otherwise you'll lose a
block<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.979> gravel<00:01:54.310> every<00:01:54.520> time<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.479> this<00:01:55.899> puts

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
block of gravel every time so this puts

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.010 
block of gravel every time so this puts
a<00:01:56.560> real<00:01:56.710> short<00:01:57.090> stroke<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.359> piston<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:58.899> it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
a real short stroke on the piston so it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.230 
a real short stroke on the piston so it
doesn't<00:01:59.319> destroy<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.659> blocks<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.899> gravel<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
doesn't destroy the blocks of gravel and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.840 
doesn't destroy the blocks of gravel and
then<00:02:04.689> we'll<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.409> flip<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.189> lever<00:02:06.340> turn<00:02:06.490> it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
then we'll just flip the lever turn it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.800 
then we'll just flip the lever turn it
on<00:02:08.490> all<00:02:09.490> know<00:02:09.700> she<00:02:09.759> goes<00:02:12.450> take<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> whole<00:02:13.780> one

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
on all know she goes take a whole one

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.149 
on all know she goes take a whole one
game<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.380> on

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:28.470 

coming<00:02:25.590> running<00:02:26.590> out<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.860> its<00:02:27.489> blowing<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
coming running out of its blowing on the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.130 
coming running out of its blowing on the
floor<00:02:28.720> gets<00:02:28.959> done<00:02:29.140> any<00:02:29.349> lower<00:02:30.599> well<00:02:31.599> now<00:02:31.900> comes

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
floor gets done any lower well now comes

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.789 
floor gets done any lower well now comes
some<00:02:32.290> gravel<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:34.299> run<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.629> of<00:02:34.690> TNT<00:02:35.470> just

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
some gravel you run out of TNT just

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.690 
some gravel you run out of TNT just
throw<00:02:36.010> gravel<00:02:36.340> Adam<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:41.620> well<00:02:42.459> there's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
throw gravel Adam all right well there's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.990 
throw gravel Adam all right well there's
a<00:02:43.019> TNT<00:02:44.019> cannon<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.680> not<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.340> space

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
a TNT cannon it's not really space

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.170 
a TNT cannon it's not really space
optimized<00:02:46.750> but<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.099> idea<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:51.180> there

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
optimized but you get the idea so there

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.700 
optimized but you get the idea so there
you<00:02:52.209> go<00:02:52.299> that's<00:02:52.840> watching
