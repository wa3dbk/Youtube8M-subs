there<00:00:43.820> except<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:44.850> model<00:00:45.210> 100<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.020> adds<00:00:46.579> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
there except for model 100 and adds but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.090 
there except for model 100 and adds but
I'd<00:00:47.850> recommend<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.110> wordless

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I'd recommend going on to a wordless

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060 
I'd recommend going on to a wordless
world<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.969> whatever<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.350> Wars<00:00:52.680> or

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
world or whatever or so Wars or

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
world or whatever or so Wars or
something<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:54.390> only<00:00:54.780> Pure's<00:00:55.140> go

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
something like that where only Pure's go

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.459 
something like that where only Pure's go
on<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.149> because<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.170> lot<00:00:58.440> easier

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
on to because it's just a lot easier

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
because you don't really see any purist

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.959 
because you don't really see any purist
fighting<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.809> akuze<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.410> ghosts<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.399> skeletons

fighting on akuze or ghosts or skeletons

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
fighting on akuze or ghosts or skeletons

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
60 times 60 a skeletons and you get the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.260 
60 times 60 a skeletons and you get the
77<00:05:39.940> ghosts<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.919> 77<00:05:42.460> ghosts<00:05:42.610> I'm<00:05:42.940> very

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
77 ghosts and the 77 ghosts I'm very

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.510 
77 ghosts and the 77 ghosts I'm very
very<00:05:43.540> very<00:05:43.780> lethal<00:05:44.169> so<00:05:44.830> let's<00:05:45.010> watch<00:05:45.130> out<00:05:45.370> for

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
very very lethal so let's watch out for

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.430 
very very lethal so let's watch out for
those<00:05:45.640> skeletons<00:05:46.570> are<00:05:46.660> morally<00:05:46.870> fall<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.260> guess

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
those skeletons are morally fall I guess

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.250 
those skeletons are morally fall I guess
curls<00:05:48.310> we<00:05:48.550> do<00:05:48.669> hit<00:05:48.850> about<00:05:49.000> stone<00:05:49.300> is<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.870> we<00:05:50.110> go

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
curls we do hit about stone is and we go

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.620 
curls we do hit about stone is and we go
to<00:05:50.470> about<00:05:50.590> seven<00:05:50.979> days<00:05:51.100> so<00:05:51.370> you'd<00:05:51.910> also<00:05:52.180> make

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
to about seven days so you'd also make

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.700 
to about seven days so you'd also make
mainly<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.620> same<00:05:53.860> so<00:05:54.550> yeah<00:05:55.140> all<00:05:56.140> right<00:05:56.290> so<00:05:56.500> now
