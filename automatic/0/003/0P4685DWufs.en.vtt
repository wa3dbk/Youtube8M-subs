00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
software I found to be pretty bad it was

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.799 
software I found to be pretty bad it was
once<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> started<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> try<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.300> faster

moves<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.260> incorporate<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> fader<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.820> just

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
moves and incorporate the fader it just

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.229 
moves and incorporate the fader it just
it<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.640> connectivity<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> didn't

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it just had no connectivity so it didn't

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.579 
it just had no connectivity so it didn't
feel<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:04.019> happening<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.500> same

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
feel like it was happening at the same

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.080 
feel like it was happening at the same
time<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.189> hand<00:01:05.400> movements<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
time as your hand movements and the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.600 
time as your hand movements and the
sound<00:01:06.330> wasn't<00:01:06.659> great<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.490> unfortunately<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
sound wasn't great and unfortunately the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.380 
sound wasn't great and unfortunately the
same<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:10.229> case<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> tractor<00:01:11.850> mapping

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
same is the case for the tractor mapping

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.090 
same is the case for the tractor mapping
I<00:01:12.570> set<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.260> controller<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I set this controller up with the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.120 
I set this controller up with the

just<00:01:17.369> wasn't<00:01:17.759> responsive<00:01:18.330> enough<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.960> me<00:01:19.159> but

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just wasn't responsive enough for me but

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.300 
just wasn't responsive enough for me but

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
scratching is the scratch button here

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.890 
scratching is the scratch button here
which<00:01:37.320> when<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.920> blue<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:39.090> means<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.540> in

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
which when it's blue that means it's in

scratch mode and that means that when
you<00:01:41.670> grab<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> jog<00:01:42.210> wheel<00:01:42.420> you'll<00:01:42.930> be

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you grab the jog wheel you'll be

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.730 
you grab the jog wheel you'll be
grabbing<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.590> sound<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.220> scratching

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.490 
let's dive straight into the software as
I<00:01:50.070> said<00:01:50.220> we're<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> look<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.759> Virtual<00:01:51.149> DJ

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
I said we're going to look at Virtual DJ

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.289 
I said we're going to look at Virtual DJ
and<00:01:52.500> we'll<00:01:52.829> show<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.850> optimum

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and we'll show you what the optimum

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.940 
and we'll show you what the optimum
