00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
as I said last week we start off with

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.960 
as I said last week we start off with
the<00:02:21.010> client<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.220> student<00:02:23.800> lying<00:02:24.800> down<00:02:25.160> now<00:02:25.760> I'm

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
the client or student lying down now I'm

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.330 
the client or student lying down now I'm
going<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.660> doing

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
going to be doing

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.960 
going to be doing
a<00:02:28.370> body<00:02:28.730> reading<00:02:29.390> lesson<00:02:30.290> some<00:02:31.250> point<00:02:31.519> later

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.220 

later<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> course<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.170> think

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
later on in the course and I think

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.650 
later on in the course and I think
you'll<00:02:36.500> find<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.769> very<00:02:37.160> interesting<00:02:37.430> but<00:02:38.060> we

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you'll find that very interesting but we

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.240 
you'll find that very interesting but we
were<00:02:38.750> not<00:02:38.900> going<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.080> do<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.170> today<00:02:39.530> anyway<00:02:39.769> so

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
were not going to do it today anyway so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.430 
were not going to do it today anyway so
John<00:02:40.519> is<00:02:40.670> lying<00:02:40.970> on<00:02:41.209> his<00:02:41.810> back

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
John is lying on his back

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.650 
John is lying on his back
remember<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.980> heels<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.550> very<00:02:43.730> close<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
remember the heels are very close to the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.300 
remember the heels are very close to the
end<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.170> table<00:02:46.120> all<00:02:47.120> right<00:02:47.890> ok<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:51.310> put

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
end of the table all right ok so I put

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.199 
end of the table all right ok so I put
myself<00:02:53.200> basically<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.349> tune<00:02:54.849> with<00:02:55.849> this

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
myself basically in tune with this

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.890 
myself basically in tune with this
person<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:57.049> their<00:02:57.230> energy<00:02:57.680> get<00:02:58.640> myself

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
person with their energy get myself

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.970 
person with their energy get myself
relaxed<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.080> ready<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.380> go

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
relaxed and ready to go

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.199 
relaxed and ready to go
open<00:03:01.849> myself<00:03:02.030> up<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.980> universal<00:03:03.980> energy

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.190 

ok<00:03:08.209> then<00:03:09.940> start<00:03:10.940> out<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.450> first<00:03:11.720> thing<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.140> do

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
ok then start out the first thing I do

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.680 
ok then start out the first thing I do
is<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.519> see<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.470> experience<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.480> lower

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
is just to see and experience the lower

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.640 
is just to see and experience the lower
leg<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.940> relative<00:03:20.660> tension<00:03:21.379> or

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
leg that the relative tension or

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.819 
leg that the relative tension or
relaxation<00:03:22.690> what<00:03:23.690> may<00:03:23.900> be<00:03:23.959> what<00:03:24.349> I<00:03:24.379> might<00:03:24.650> need

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
relaxation what may be what I might need

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.819 
relaxation what may be what I might need
to<00:03:25.040> focus<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.299> do<00:03:26.360> both<00:03:26.750> legs<00:03:27.170> first<00:03:27.560> so

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
to focus on and I do both legs first so

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.640 
to focus on and I do both legs first so
I<00:03:27.890> can<00:03:28.160> compare<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:29.569> know<00:03:29.599> maybe<00:03:29.930> one<00:03:30.349> side

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
I can compare you know maybe one side

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.500 
I can compare you know maybe one side
will<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.010> tighter<00:03:31.400> than<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.819> other<00:03:31.849> one<00:03:32.299> side

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
will be tighter than the other one side

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.449 
will be tighter than the other one side
would<00:03:32.750> be<00:03:32.959> looser<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:35.030> John<00:03:35.510> actually<00:03:36.470> his

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
would be looser on John actually his

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.720 
would be looser on John actually his
left<00:03:37.850> leg<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:39.079> little<00:03:39.350> tighter<00:03:39.709> than<00:03:40.310> his

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
left leg is is a little tighter than his

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.129 
left leg is is a little tighter than his
right<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:42.370> these<00:03:43.370> are<00:03:43.670> attributable<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:44.870> many

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
right and these are attributable to many

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.110 
right and these are attributable to many
different<00:03:45.349> factors<00:03:45.980> but<00:03:46.010> hopefully<00:03:46.880> we're

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
different factors but hopefully we're

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.839 
different factors but hopefully we're
going<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.420> be<00:03:48.069> balancing<00:03:49.069> them<00:03:49.220> up<00:03:49.370> as<00:03:49.549> we<00:03:49.700> go

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
going to be balancing them up as we go

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.750 
going to be balancing them up as we go
ok<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:52.540> then<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.810> cover<00:03:54.620> up<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.130> leg<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.609> I

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
ok so then I cover up that leg and I

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.110 
ok so then I cover up that leg and I
start<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.329> work<00:03:56.510> on<00:03:56.720> his<00:03:57.579> which<00:03:58.579> would<00:03:58.790> be<00:03:58.910> his

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
start to work on his which would be his

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.379 
start to work on his which would be his
right<00:03:59.450> leg<00:03:59.840> remember<00:04:00.680> tuck<00:04:00.919> it<00:04:01.069> in<00:04:03.430> ok<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.120> my

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
right leg remember tuck it in ok so my

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.479 
right leg remember tuck it in ok so my
idea<00:04:05.660> here<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.200> I'm<00:04:06.380> going<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.680> take<00:04:06.889> this<00:04:07.160> leg

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
idea here is I'm going to take this leg

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.970 
idea here is I'm going to take this leg
and<00:04:07.730> work<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.120> stretch<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.750> open<00:04:09.319> it<00:04:09.440> connect

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
and work it stretch it open it connect

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.640 
and work it stretch it open it connect
everything<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:10.669> center<00:04:11.169> open<00:04:12.169> this<00:04:12.319> leg

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
everything to the center open this leg

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.069 
everything to the center open this leg
and<00:04:13.010> let<00:04:13.669> the<00:04:13.700> energy<00:04:13.910> get<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.510> energy<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.930> run

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
and let the energy get the energy to run

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.039 
and let the energy get the energy to run
freely<00:04:15.620> through<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:17.470> going<00:04:18.470> back

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
freely through it so going back

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.080 
freely through it so going back
lengthening

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.580 

jumped<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.150> little<00:04:25.270> bit<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.840> then<00:04:25.990> we<00:04:26.260> hit<00:04:26.410> what

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
jumped a little bit and then we hit what

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.370 
jumped a little bit and then we hit what
we<00:04:26.710> hit<00:04:26.890> there<00:04:29.820> remember<00:04:30.820> now<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.900> thing<00:04:32.170> that

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
we hit there remember now the thing that

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.970 
we hit there remember now the thing that
really<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.540> notice<00:04:34.720> all<00:04:35.140> these<00:04:35.440> muscles

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
really is you notice all these muscles

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.010 
really is you notice all these muscles
as<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.490> do<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.850> particular<00:04:37.450> movement<00:04:37.780> these

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
as I do this particular movement these

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.910 
as I do this particular movement these
muscles<00:04:38.470> loosening<00:04:38.950> very<00:04:39.490> very<00:04:39.880> important

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
muscles loosening very very important

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.670 
muscles loosening very very important

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
start on the lower part of the leg get

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.560 
start on the lower part of the leg get
my<00:04:48.670> rhythm<00:04:48.910> going<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:51.150> these<00:04:52.150> are<00:04:52.330> called

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
my rhythm going and these are called

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.000 
my rhythm going and these are called
pumps<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.650> I'm<00:04:53.710> working<00:04:54.160> here<00:04:54.490> on<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.730> toes

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
pumps and I'm working here on the toes

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.070 
pumps and I'm working here on the toes
straightening<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.160> toes<00:04:58.080> gaining

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
straightening the toes gaining

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.490 
straightening the toes gaining
flexibility<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.730> them<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.690> all<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.170> various

I come in from the top and this is

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.910 
I come in from the top and this is
called<00:05:20.440> grinders<00:05:21.280> what<00:05:21.730> I'm<00:05:21.850> going<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.150> do<00:05:22.420> is

grind this arch over my thumb to help
just<00:05:28.960> loosen<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:34.080> then<00:05:35.080> taking<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.590> whole

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
just loosen and then taking the whole

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:43.340 
just loosen and then taking the whole
foot<00:05:36.340> separating<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.540> bones<00:05:38.050> inside<00:05:39.660> okay

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.570 

most<00:05:44.350> people<00:05:44.620> aren't<00:05:44.710> aware<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.280> feet

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
most people aren't aware that the feet

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.170 
most people aren't aware that the feet
can<00:05:45.820> move<00:05:45.850> as<00:05:46.540> well<00:05:46.990> as<00:05:47.140> they<00:05:47.290> do<00:05:47.400> yeah<00:05:48.430> good

can move as well as they do yeah good

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.680 
can move as well as they do yeah good
then<00:05:49.600> I<00:05:49.720> go<00:05:49.870> back<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.350> few<00:05:50.620> more<00:05:50.830> pumps<00:05:51.100> and

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
then I go back to a few more pumps and

then I go back to a few more pumps and
that's<00:05:52.690> it<00:05:53.620> for<00:05:54.250> sitting<00:05:54.790> out<00:05:55.440> coming<00:05:56.440> back

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
that's it for sitting out coming back

dirty rapp to stretch the whole foot I'm
just<00:06:20.290> leaning<00:06:20.560> we<00:06:21.280> use<00:06:21.550> our<00:06:21.850> body<00:06:22.240> weight<00:06:22.510> as

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
just leaning we use our body weight as

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.950 
just leaning we use our body weight as
much<00:06:22.720> as<00:06:23.050> possible<00:06:23.290> here<00:06:23.830> I'm<00:06:24.270> leaning<00:06:25.270> it

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
much as possible here I'm leaning it

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.960 
much as possible here I'm leaning it
when<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.530> use<00:06:26.710> your<00:06:26.740> hands<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.310> tend<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.580> grab

when you use your hands you tend to grab

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.670 
when you use your hands you tend to grab
quite<00:06:28.480> a<00:06:28.510> bit<00:06:28.750> so<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:28.930> don't<00:06:28.990> want<00:06:29.290> to<00:06:29.380> do<00:06:29.530> that

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
quite a bit so I don't want to do that

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.370 
quite a bit so I don't want to do that
nice<00:06:30.310> soft<00:06:30.670> hands<00:06:31.240> leaning<00:06:32.200> okay

nice soft hands leaning okay

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.830 
nice soft hands leaning okay
then<00:06:33.610> this<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:34.760> called<00:06:34.790> little<00:06:35.180> jack<00:06:35.420> horner

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
then this is called little jack horner

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.870 
then this is called little jack horner
see<00:06:36.050> like<00:06:36.530> this<00:06:36.770> and<00:06:37.460> i<00:06:38.860> gaining<00:06:39.880> flexibility

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
see like this and i gaining flexibility

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.760 
see like this and i gaining flexibility
to<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.270> ankle<00:06:41.720> joint<00:06:42.020> and<00:06:42.320> all<00:06:42.560> the

to the ankle joint and all the
connective<00:06:43.250> tissues<00:06:43.610> so<00:06:44.000> I<00:06:44.030> take<00:06:44.360> the<00:06:44.570> ankle

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
connective tissues so I take the ankle

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.500 
connective tissues so I take the ankle
as<00:06:45.170> far<00:06:45.650> as<00:06:45.800> it<00:06:45.950> could<00:06:46.100> possibly<00:06:46.310> go<00:06:46.670> in<00:06:47.150> all

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
as far as it could possibly go in all

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.860 
as far as it could possibly go in all
directions<00:06:48.190> then<00:06:49.190> leaning<00:06:49.850> back<00:06:50.060> stretching

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
directions then leaning back stretching

turning<00:06:55.400> it<00:06:55.520> in<00:06:55.670> to<00:06:55.940> stretch<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.420> tendon<00:06:56.750> to

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
turning it in to stretch the tendon to

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.200 
turning it in to stretch the tendon to
the<00:06:56.930> outside<00:06:57.200> and<00:06:57.380> then<00:06:57.890> pump<00:06:58.280> working<00:06:58.820> the

upon is the person's problem I would do

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.290 
upon is the person's problem I would do
generally<00:07:10.220> I<00:07:10.250> would<00:07:10.370> do<00:07:10.490> a<00:07:10.520> little<00:07:10.910> more<00:07:11.120> than

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
generally I would do a little more than

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.750 
generally I would do a little more than
I'm<00:07:11.360> doing<00:07:11.420> now<00:07:11.810> but<00:07:12.320> I<00:07:12.380> might<00:07:12.770> do<00:07:12.920> quite<00:07:13.490> a<00:07:13.520> bit

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.760 
I'm doing now but I might do quite a bit

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.730 
I'm doing now but I might do quite a bit
more<00:07:14.000> if<00:07:14.150> they<00:07:14.300> have<00:07:14.450> foot<00:07:14.750> problems<00:07:14.930> but<00:07:15.470> John

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
more if they have foot problems but John

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.660 
more if they have foot problems but John
doesn't<00:07:15.980> so<00:07:16.780> okay<00:07:17.780> and<00:07:18.050> that's<00:07:18.950> it<00:07:19.190> basically

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.670 
doesn't so okay and that's it basically

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.970 
doesn't so okay and that's it basically
but<00:07:20.540> if<00:07:20.600> we<00:07:20.840> move<00:07:21.050> the<00:07:21.230> foot<00:07:21.470> in<00:07:21.650> every

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
but if we move the foot in every

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.300 
but if we move the foot in every
possible<00:07:22.400> way<00:07:22.760> that<00:07:23.180> we<00:07:23.510> take<00:07:23.810> the<00:07:24.020> toes

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
possible way that we take the toes

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.220 
possible way that we take the toes
didn't<00:07:25.310> do<00:07:25.370> the<00:07:25.520> tope<00:07:25.940> like<00:07:26.150> separating<00:07:27.050> the

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
didn't do the tope like separating the

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.930 
didn't do the tope like separating the
bones<00:07:27.530> here<00:07:28.220> in<00:07:28.790> the<00:07:29.090> foot<00:07:30.790> you're<00:07:31.790> just

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 
bones here in the foot you're just

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.870 
bones here in the foot you're just
taking<00:07:32.120> the<00:07:32.360> bones<00:07:32.690> and<00:07:32.990> moving<00:07:33.680> them

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
taking the bones and moving them

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.220 
taking the bones and moving them
separately<00:07:34.880> it's<00:07:35.090> very<00:07:35.330> it's<00:07:35.600> a<00:07:35.720> lot<00:07:35.870> of<00:07:35.900> fun

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230
