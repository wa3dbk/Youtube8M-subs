00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.980 
show you how to make these a call
floating<00:00:06.150> platform<00:00:06.839> thingies<00:00:08.719> you<00:00:09.719> can<00:00:09.840> use

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
floating platform thingies you can use

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.360 
floating platform thingies you can use
them<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.290> several<00:00:10.620> different<00:00:10.679> ways<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.130> don't

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
them in several different ways you don't

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.299 
them in several different ways you don't
need<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> bounce<00:00:12.150> pass<00:00:13.070> this<00:00:14.070> is

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
need and with the bounce pass this is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.730 
need and with the bounce pass this is
just<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.500> sneak

preview<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:30.320> obviously<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.740> this

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
preview and obviously you can use this

buck show you just go over here I'm not
sure<00:00:41.010> why<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.030> already<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
sure why this is here already but it is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
sure why this is here already but it is
and<00:00:44.010> if<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> preview<00:00:45.600> mode<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.500> can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and if you have a preview mode you can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
and if you have a preview mode you can
see<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.760> moving<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.329> via<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
see it is just moving up and down via a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
see it is just moving up and down via a
piston<00:00:50.510> now<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.719> pause<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.199> um<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.010> thing

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
piston now if I pause this um this thing

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.779 
piston now if I pause this um this thing
is<00:00:54.030> an<00:00:54.570> anti<00:00:54.899> graphic<00:00:55.260> gravity<00:00:55.890> ping<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
is an anti graphic gravity ping and is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.420 
is an anti graphic gravity ping and is
not<00:00:57.000> necessary<00:00:57.629> before<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.190> why

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
not necessary before I do not know why

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
not necessary before I do not know why
it<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.960> actually<00:01:01.109> on

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it is on there but it is actually on

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.310 
it is on there but it is actually on
there<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.730> ones<00:01:03.030> probably<00:01:03.780> adding

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
there on all of my ones probably adding

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.250 
there on all of my ones probably adding
more<00:01:04.619> mama<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> space<00:01:05.970> than<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> needed<00:01:06.510> but

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
more mama to space than is needed but

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.750 
more mama to space than is needed but
never<00:01:07.320> mind<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> start<00:01:11.280> off<00:01:11.340> doing

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
never mind so what you start off doing

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.960 
never mind so what you start off doing
is<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> material<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.760> use

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
is you get the material you want to use

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
is you get the material you want to use
and<00:01:16.670> I'm<00:01:17.670> gonna<00:01:17.820> stick<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.240> grid<00:01:18.830> just<00:01:19.830> for

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and I'm gonna stick it on grid just for

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.840 
and I'm gonna stick it on grid just for
this<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:20.729> um<00:01:22.460> make<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> about

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this little bit here um make it about

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.929 
this little bit here um make it about
that<00:01:24.030> length<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.920> why<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:28.979> boys<00:01:31.790> cut<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that length and then why do boys cut the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.499 
that length and then why do boys cut the
corners<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
corners a little bit you don't have to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.859 
corners a little bit you don't have to
you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.810> whatever<00:01:36.960> design<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
you can use whatever design you one and

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
you can use whatever design you one and
I<00:01:39.869> never<00:01:40.350> Munt<00:01:40.530> remember<00:01:41.040> why<00:01:41.130> i<00:01:41.159> had<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
I never Munt remember why i had the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
I never Munt remember why i had the
antigravity<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.390> stuck<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.170> while<00:01:43.380> i

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
antigravity thing is stuck it on while i

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.429 
antigravity thing is stuck it on while i
was<00:01:43.710> messing<00:01:44.159> around<00:01:44.220> doing<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.820> bit

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
was messing around doing all this bit

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.740 
was messing around doing all this bit
and<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.600> some

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and now what you want to do is get some

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.600 
and now what you want to do is get some
dark<00:01:49.020> matter<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.990> turn<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.200> grid<00:01:52.560> mode<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
dark matter and turn off grid mode so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.450 
dark matter and turn off grid mode so
you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.119> disappear<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.430> very

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you can make it disappear it was very

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
you can make it disappear it was very
small<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> disappears<00:01:57.509> which<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.320> quite<00:01:58.590> handy

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
small it disappears which is quite handy

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.649 
small it disappears which is quite handy
um<00:01:59.329> and<00:02:00.329> i<00:02:00.719> did<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:01.170> make<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> small<00:02:01.799> enough

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
um and i did not make it small enough

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.500 
um and i did not make it small enough
therefore<00:02:03.740> shrink<00:02:04.740> there<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.759> go

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
therefore shrink there we go

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.210 
therefore shrink there we go
now<00:02:08.320> let's<00:02:08.740> switch<00:02:09.070> grid<00:02:09.700> mode<00:02:09.940> back<00:02:10.300> on<00:02:10.540> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
now let's switch grid mode back on and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.670 
now let's switch grid mode back on and
select<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.960> just<00:02:13.960> stick<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.470> somewhere

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
select this just stick it somewhere

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.870 
select this just stick it somewhere
where<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.310> easy<00:02:15.820> for<00:02:16.210> me<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.360> use<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.880> grab

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
where it's easy for me to use and grab

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.100 
where it's easy for me to use and grab
myself<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.360> piston<00:02:20.820> um<00:02:21.820> make<00:02:22.600> sure<00:02:22.720> its<00:02:22.870> upright

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
myself a piston um make sure its upright

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
myself a piston um make sure its upright
and<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.620> should<00:02:23.890> all<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.160> fine<00:02:24.370> there<00:02:24.700> and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and that should all be fine there and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.730 
and that should all be fine there and
then<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.960> want<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.820> get<00:02:27.820> rid<00:02:28.090> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
excess excess is that how you pronounce

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.530 
excess excess is that how you pronounce
the<00:02:34.270> word<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.720> think<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.590> will<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.830> um<00:02:36.540> you're

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
you here on this one you can land on it

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.920 
you here on this one you can land on it
um<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:48.790> not<00:02:48.940> sure<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.240> can<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.690> one

um I'm not sure if you can on this one

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.030 
um I'm not sure if you can on this one
so<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.410> did<00:02:50.560> make<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.860> quite<00:02:51.070> small<00:02:52.500> no<00:02:53.500> that

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
so I did make it quite small no that

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.630 
so I did make it quite small no that
should<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.710> make<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.160> pistol

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
should do and then just make the pistol

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.280 
should do and then just make the pistol
a<00:02:57.730> little<00:02:58.180> bit<00:02:58.300> bigger<00:02:58.709> um<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:01.060> should<00:03:01.600> do<00:03:01.930> I'll

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
a little bit bigger um I should do I'll

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.550 
a little bit bigger um I should do I'll
make<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> bit<00:03:02.800> faster<00:03:05.550> um<00:03:07.290> crease<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.320> a

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
make it a bit faster um crease that a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.270 
make it a bit faster um crease that a
little<00:03:08.920> bit<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:11.830> about<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.130> same

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
little bit and that's about the same

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.330 
little bit and that's about the same
with<00:03:12.489> model<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:14.230> now<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.410> want<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.770> do<00:03:14.980> is

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
with model and now I want to do is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.550 
with model and now I want to do is
create<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.660> little<00:03:17.260> hologram<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.410> make

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
create a little hologram so just make

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.479 
create a little hologram so just make
that<00:03:20.739> roughly<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.310> same<00:03:21.489> size<00:03:21.550> as<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:23.769> thing

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
that roughly the same size as your thing

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.360 
that roughly the same size as your thing
you're<00:03:25.060> floating<00:03:25.300> platform<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:27.209> then<00:03:29.370> move

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
you're floating platform and then move

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.800 
you're floating platform and then move
the<00:03:30.489> other<00:03:30.670> way<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.030> don't<00:03:31.060> capture<00:03:31.420> any

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the other way so I don't capture any

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.290 
the other way so I don't capture any
Dark<00:03:32.050> Matter<00:03:32.320> anything<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:33.790> capture<00:03:34.030> as<00:03:34.150> an

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
Dark Matter anything just capture as an

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.100 
Dark Matter anything just capture as an
object<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:36.209> get<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.360> meter<00:03:39.900> Paul's<00:03:40.900> it's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
object and get to the meter Paul's it's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.280 
object and get to the meter Paul's it's
you<00:03:41.230> stick<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.680> easier<00:03:42.239> eat<00:03:43.239> more<00:03:43.570> easily

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
you stick it on easier eat more easily

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.840 
you stick it on easier eat more easily
and<00:03:49.620> make<00:03:50.620> sure<00:03:50.650> it's<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.040> same<00:03:51.220> layer<00:03:51.489> of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
and make sure it's in the same layer of

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.320 
and make sure it's in the same layer of
course<00:03:53.040> which<00:03:54.040> i'm<00:03:54.250> not<00:03:54.459> sure<00:03:54.700> i<00:03:54.730> was<00:03:55.030> doing

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
course which i'm not sure i was doing

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.030 
course which i'm not sure i was doing
before<00:03:56.040> anyway<00:03:57.040> um<00:03:58.739> stick<00:03:59.739> that<00:03:59.860> down

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
before anyway um stick that down

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.150 
before anyway um stick that down
somewhere<00:04:00.370> like<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:01.350> change<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.470> frequency

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
somewhere like that change the frequency

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.500 
somewhere like that change the frequency
to<00:04:03.430> about<00:04:03.640> not<00:04:03.970> point<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:07.209> don't<00:04:07.390> I'm

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
to about not point to you don't I'm

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.120 
to about not point to you don't I'm
lasting<00:04:07.959> too<00:04:08.080> long<00:04:08.110> i<00:04:08.380> was<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:08.920> stick<00:04:09.100> that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
lasting too long i was just stick that

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.800 
lasting too long i was just stick that
quite<00:04:09.550> low<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:12.070> want<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.489> expand<00:04:13.360> and

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
quite low and you want it to expand and

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.020 
quite low and you want it to expand and
fade<00:04:15.500> for<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.100> effect<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:18.250> one<00:04:19.250> thing<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:19.639> did

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
fade for the effect and one thing I did

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.129 
fade for the effect and one thing I did
forget<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.480> do<00:04:20.889> was<00:04:22.210> make<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.450> not<00:04:23.690> visible

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
forget to do was make that not visible

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.140 
forget to do was make that not visible
in<00:04:24.200> play<00:04:24.410> mode<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:28.900> leave<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:30.080> works

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
in play mode and leave that works

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.820 
in play mode and leave that works
perfect<00:04:34.090> now<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.630> can<00:04:35.720> just<00:04:35.900> use<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.290> as<00:04:36.530> a

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
perfect now you can just use that as a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
perfect now you can just use that as a
floating<00:04:37.639> platform<00:04:39.040> as<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.520> see<00:04:40.639> there

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
floating platform as you can see there

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.300 
floating platform as you can see there
you<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.870> add<00:04:41.960> sound<00:04:42.230> effects<00:04:42.620> through<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:43.070> I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
you can add sound effects through it I

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.180 
you can add sound effects through it I
just<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.940> couple<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.330> bounce<00:04:44.510> pads<00:04:44.810> on<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.200> you

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
just a couple of bounce pads on it you

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.120 
just a couple of bounce pads on it you
can<00:04:46.280> use<00:04:46.430> our<00:04:46.580> view<00:04:46.850> one<00:04:47.710> get<00:04:48.710> rid<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.010> and

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
can use our view one get rid of that and

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.330 
can use our view one get rid of that and
you<00:04:52.130> can<00:04:52.310> just<00:04:52.580> omit<00:04:52.850> these<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.600> make<00:04:54.340> little

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
you can just omit these to make little

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.860 
you can just omit these to make little
um<00:04:55.600> little<00:04:56.600> bits<00:04:56.750> gameplay<00:04:57.169> loading<00:04:57.919> things

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
um little bits gameplay loading things

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.320 
um little bits gameplay loading things
sevens<00:04:59.870> hovering<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:00.950> yeah<00:05:01.370> it's<00:05:01.910> just<00:05:02.060> quite

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
sevens hovering so yeah it's just quite

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.290 
sevens hovering so yeah it's just quite
a<00:05:02.360> nice<00:05:02.540> effect<00:05:02.690> easy<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.860> do<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.060> thought

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
a nice effect easy to do so I thought

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.520 
a nice effect easy to do so I thought
