00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone with you maxim and this channel 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 good choice today we will test 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 radeon 7770 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.679
 in conjunction with the fx 6300 processor this time 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.780
 already as it should be immediately asleep wait 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 by the monitor and by the way for the monitor because 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.050
 video card thank you so much store 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 firm city ​​of ufa 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.720
 firm dot ru this they provided 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.430
 technique for review Well, let's go so 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.289
 even incomprehensible to me tradition 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.849
 let's start with skyrim naturally all on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 ultra settings and enabled 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.540
 fourfold oil and smoothing and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.210
 of course high resolution textures 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.790
 also included and immediately rushes to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.200
 eyes that for some reason in the city of drawdown to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.210
 30 frames per second 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.059
 these tests are by no means claimed 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 on scientific atomic accuracy is possible 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.239
 it was worth putting just 2-fold 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.640
 whether smoothing is just fx and and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.710
 but according to my subjective feelings gtx650 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.469
 coped with skyrim much better 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.180
 at least there were squats 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.010
 a maximum of 45 frames from me does not change 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.079
 memory but in the description of course will 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.000
 a link to that video can see 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 compare yourself here why are you okay 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.659
 up to 40 shots calm in the forest 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 but natural caves and closed 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.350
 the rooms will be 60 maybe really worth it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.570
 just dilute the wells to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 double or even fx and and put 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 the processor is about half load and 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 as you see the main load falls 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.689
 just two cores graphics card works 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 practically at the limit there are 98 to 100 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.610
 percent watch dogs put permissions 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.860
 medium textures and the same settings with 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 which I tested gtx650 on my 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.900
 small monitor right here me 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.509
 the result has already pleased radeon 7770 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 produces from 30 to 40 frames per second at 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.729
 Full hd resolution is about the same 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.579
 gave out gtx 650 but at 1280 resolution 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.890
 1024 I certainly will do something else 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.689
 run full hd permissions but for now 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.329
 the moment is what I see on the organ of me 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.420
 happy and even now if you get out of the car 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.829
 you can get more than 40 frames 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 the processor is 60 percent loaded 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.899
 video card runs to full 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 krayzis 3 put permissions and we 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.700
 let's just start with medium settings game 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.600
 herself offers and as I said in 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.239
 previous test 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.679
 this is one of the most loaded scenes here 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.019
 a lot of grass open spaces 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 reflections so this is probably the worst 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.280
 script for video card in principle 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.239
 30 frames per second but during shootouts 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.340
 and at 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.200
 effects can drop to 20 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.950
 the results are basically the same as those 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.750
 we saw on gtx 650 and how from this game 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.340
 squeeze even more frames per second me too 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 already said link to video 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.790
 also have in the description can go 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 look into paint these video cards 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.750
 roughly equal video card works 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.290
 for some reason with a processor drawdown 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.390
 loaded 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 more than half the distribution 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 load on cores is uneven 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.970
 battlefield 4 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.760
 Full hd resolutions at a screen naturally 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.970
 And Kostanay settings I played with such 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.950
 my monitor and I had from 45 to 55 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.140
 and cadres somewhere so skirmish in 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 closed room gunfight here in the field 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.530
 more or less open space and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.780
 consistently 45 frames 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.400
 more than playable can be omitted 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 just to medium like a game automatically 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.510
 offers get an increase of about 5 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.790
 frames and the counter will be stable 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.040
 show about 50 on ultra settings 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.019
 clearly more than the 50 it jetix mustache 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 certainly not critical but still nice 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.620
 if you drop to something more 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.510
 prudent here you see i set 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.829
 simple he so need a key and anti-aliasing 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.109
 put a little less quality 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.590
 post processing and in principle about 30 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.569
 frames 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.130
 but in the explosions there is sagging so 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.200
 this is still a little tweaking 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.720
 slow down but again it did everything 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.569
 can watch other videos 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.639
 subjective ardon 7770 here is a little 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.690
 more frames 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.150
 CPU load is also uneven 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.690
 and the video card also works to its fullest 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.760
 power 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.829
 assasins creed black flag full hd 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.280
 permission to build you too them already 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.930
 have seen medium-high and again here 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.940
 radon a little more frames 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.769
 but still this is not the most optimal 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.359
 something is better to lower settings or 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.030
 resolution or even with parameters 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.600
 play around and because 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.670
 sea bats sags to 25 although 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.410
 cities kept at 30 frames what 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.310
 on the roof that just when walking on 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.980
 25 islands when a lot of green about 20 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.970
 gtx650 and it seems there to twelve 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.940
 personnel sags 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.230
 so up to in difficult scenes probably 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.530
 7770 here is an advantage again 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.639
 video cards running at full capacity 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.889
 CPU is mainly involved 1 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.690
 bucket load on the others too there 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.330
 in general, the processor is loaded 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.030
 50 percent were found well and 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.770
 In conclusion let it be dota 2 horses 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.810
 resolution vertical sync 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.700
 disabled everything else is unscrewed on 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.560
 ultra but here from in more or less 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.760
 loaded the scene the counter sags to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.460
 fifty five frames 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.860
 I think that in the most difficult batches below 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.890
 50 won't be basically how it works 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.110
 about 70 frames per second and give nearly 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.720
 forgot the processor is loaded 40 percent 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.600
 on the load on the graphics card from 80 to 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.240
 100 percent radeon 7770 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.490
 and gtx650 video card about one 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.320
 price range at the start of sales of the genus 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.270
 it was significantly cheaper now prices 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.830
 almost equal and of course in 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.350
 Different stores are still different but 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.210
 the difference may be 200 300 rubles word 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.490
 in general, if you sum up 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.530
 here are our two latest releases then 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.479
 you get something like this if you don’t 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.700
 addicted to editing or doing simple 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.010
 videos are mostly playing and can 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.750
 get it radon cheaper then take it 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.460
 you will be satisfied if for you 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.380
 important file conversion speed and 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.460
 just need such a small even 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.080
 installation comfort 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.000
 or if with such limited 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.000
 budget you still want to stream games then I 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.740
 I think that gtx 650 will suit you more but 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.110
 but in most radeon 7770 games 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.120
 gives a little more frames per second 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.979
 the choice of course is yours and depends on 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.680
 your needs and the fact that you 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.510
 going to do everything on this and here 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.640
 wonderful hook that stands by 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.140
 me behind and another one that is not in 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.110
 the frame will soon find their lucky 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.030
 holders today or pinch 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.400
 tomorrow i am already 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.140
 draw a draw so watch out for 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.640
 announcements can find me on twitter and 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.710
 because there I am making announcements of all 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.570
 standing issues and just sharing 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.340
 short useful information required

 assemblies or just about some details 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.250
 because there are already quite a few people
