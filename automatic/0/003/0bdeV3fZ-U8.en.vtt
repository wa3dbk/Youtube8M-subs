00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
prepping cloths I guess they're just a

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.380 
prepping cloths I guess they're just a

very high alcohol content and you

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.450 
very high alcohol content and you
basically<00:01:59.840> clean<00:02:00.079> up<00:02:00.200> everything<00:02:00.650> because

basically clean up everything because

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.950 
basically clean up everything because

you're literally pulling the old one off
clapping<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.040> new<00:02:23.250> one<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.060> good

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
clapping this new one on and it's good

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.430 
clapping this new one on and it's good
to<00:02:24.360> go<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.660> course<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.960> does<00:02:25.110> come<00:02:25.320> with

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
to go and of course it does come with

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.590 
to go and of course it does come with
instructions<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.340> being<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.450> that's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
instructions and being that that's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.620 
instructions and being that that's
perova<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> course<00:02:28.500> they're<00:02:28.680> Japanese<00:02:28.890> but

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
perova of course they're Japanese but

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.180 
perova of course they're Japanese but
the<00:02:30.630> instructions<00:02:31.110> are<00:02:31.230> great<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.890> they

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the instructions are great in that they

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.670 
the instructions are great in that they
show<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.520> picture<00:02:33.300> by<00:02:33.450> picture<00:02:33.480> exactly<00:02:34.470> how

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
show you picture by picture exactly how

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.890 
show you picture by picture exactly how
to<00:02:34.740> do<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> use<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.510> when<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.780> was

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
to do it and so I use this when I was

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.540 
to do it and so I use this when I was
doing<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.140> install<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.740> definitely<00:02:38.280> helped

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
doing the install it definitely helped

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.130 
doing the install it definitely helped
out<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.300> could<00:02:39.480> probably<00:02:39.540> figure<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:39.990> out

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
out now you could probably figure it out

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.180 
out now you could probably figure it out
without<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.530> instructions<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.070> with

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
without the instructions but with

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.260 
without the instructions but with
anything<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.610> always<00:02:41.670> recommend<00:02:41.940> going

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
anything I always recommend going

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.430 
anything I always recommend going
through<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> instructions<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.080> making

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
through the instructions just making

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.470 
through the instructions just making
sure<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.710> understand<00:02:44.190> exactly<00:02:44.460> what<00:02:45.360> you're

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
sure you understand exactly what you're

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.660 
sure you understand exactly what you're
getting<00:02:45.570> yourself<00:02:46.020> into

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
getting yourself into

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
getting yourself into
especially<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> really<00:02:48.090> nice<00:02:48.240> piece<00:02:48.510> like

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
especially for a really nice piece like

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.450 
especially for a really nice piece like
this<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.740> want<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.980> make<00:02:50.100> sure<00:02:50.250> that

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
this you just want to make sure that

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.880 
this you just want to make sure that
because<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.060> an<00:02:51.180> aesthetic<00:02:51.570> item<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.380> you

because it is an aesthetic item that you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.970 
because it is an aesthetic item that you
take<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.130> time<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.610> know<00:02:54.710> installing<00:02:55.710> it

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
square level everything matches up but

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.250 
square level everything matches up but

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's a very subtle modification but
that's<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.050> like<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.560> much<00:03:10.710> about<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.160> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that's what I like so much about it is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
that's what I like so much about it is
because<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.820> does<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.630> know<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:13.020> change

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
because it does you know really change

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.440 
because it does you know really change
the<00:03:13.470> way<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> car<00:03:14.010> looks<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the way the car looks but to the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.610 
the way the car looks but to the
untrained<00:03:15.780> eye<00:03:15.960> they<00:03:16.350> wouldn't<00:03:16.560> really

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
untrained eye they wouldn't really

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.900 
untrained eye they wouldn't really
notice<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:17.070> difference<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.790> those

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
notice a difference it's just those

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
notice a difference it's just those
people<00:03:18.270> that<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.570> what<00:03:18.600> they're<00:03:18.810> looking

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
people that know what they're looking

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.630 
people that know what they're looking
for<00:03:19.140> well<00:03:19.740> know<00:03:19.860> exactly<00:03:20.280> what<00:03:20.490> they're

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
for well know exactly what they're

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.400 
for well know exactly what they're
looking<00:03:20.940> at<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.780> that's<00:03:22.020> one<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
looking at and so that's one of the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.230 
looking at and so that's one of the
things<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.860> really<00:03:23.580> like<00:03:23.700> about<00:03:23.730> these<00:03:24.000> plus

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240
