00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello this is loÃ¯c the garden this 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.830
 video is part of the series a kitchen garden 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.660
 to change the world 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.910
 you've probably heard that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.880
 by dint of cultivating a land she 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.870
 gets poorer and you have to mount it 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.570
 makes sense to you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.359
 you think that plants draws 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.920
 nutrients in the soil and that 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.230
 down force these elements come to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.060
 to miss it is true in the case of our 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.210
 traditional farming which consists of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 to harvest everything that the plot has 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 product already know that it's not the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.920
 plant culture that has pro and who 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 depletes the soil but the harvest especially 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 when the harvest consists of shaving everything 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.969
 without ordering anything to the earth in a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.280
 natural cycle everything that is produced 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.410
 on a given surface returns to the ground 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 with a profit 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.710
 this benefit is produced by the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 photosynthesis 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.829
 basically if you grow whatever the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.809
 plant surface given and leave you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.879
 plans to do their natural cycle 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.060
 after giving seeds they go 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.770
 die on the spot and restores to the ground what 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.720
 that they took is brought in addition 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.010
 what they produced what they have 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.710
 produced through photosynthesis 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 know that a plant is made up 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.590
 mainly from elements that come 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 air and not soil so for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 enrich our soil we do not need 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.090
 nothing but what pushes on 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.020
 our soil we just have to look after him 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 give back more than we want 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.560
 in the case of the vegetable garden it is not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 always easy to measure when you 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.150
 grow carrots of potatoes on 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.950
 realize well that we take +1 down to earth 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
 yes rest of the tale well even you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.190
 would leave the fans on the spot to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.440
 balance the balance 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.200
 we must cultivate more than we can 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.080
 harvest it's kind of the command of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.780
 this video in your kitchen garden 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.490
 must take care to leave as much as possible 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.980
 on the spot what he produced 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.810
 so when you go pick a 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.590
 salad instead of peeling it into your 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.630
 cooked 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.640
 leave the first leaves you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.369
 do not eat on the spot as well 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.590
 that the foot you took care of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.490
 leave in the ground so we do not tear 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.470
 not a salad we just cut it 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.540
 harvest of this salad is not 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.270
 compensated because will consume the most 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.250
 much of it so you have to have in 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.150
 your vegetable garden a culture that we 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.920
 consumes low and that one will be destined to 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.290
 return full of stuffing that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.050
 may be fertilizers 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.760
 but plants permanent plants 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.410
 honey 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.200
 in short, any plant whose vocation is 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.739
 to bring a positive balance in terms 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.430
 subscriptions the amendment in my opinion 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.019
 it's the role of the limits of the kitchen garden 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 to try to represent the 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.010
 things we can say that way more 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.250
 general the planks of culture have a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.160
 rather negative balance because we will take 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.380
 a lot then we have to compensate this 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.620
 negative balance sheet with balance sheet areas 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.170
 positive as is for example where from 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.670
 the interest of including these at multiple 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.459
 profits in our kitchen gardens 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.959
 because in addition to having a positive balance sheet 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.680
 they are the cradle of biodiversity 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.739
 the biodiversity 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.269
 this will be the subject of the next video if 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.890
 the video you liked click on the thumb 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 in the air it allows me to progress 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.190
 follow the series a vegetable garden to change 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.140
 the world

 receive new videos by email 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.060
 as well as the beginners' garden'art kit 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.430
 but you just have to click on the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.690
 button that appears in front of me at 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.690
