 Hi there, you are watching Channel 9: 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 bodybuilding recipes my name is paul 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.740
 Today I will teach you to cook a lot 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 Increased Calorie Scrambled Eggs 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 for cooking this dish i will 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.330
 use 5 persons 100 grams of cheese 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.320
 medium fat 150 grams of ham 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.969
 one tomato fresh dill 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 concentrated lemon juice and spices 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.219
 Now for the cooking process 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.200
 because this is the most interesting and let's start with 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 that heat the pan and add to it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 five eggs and of course no butter 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 I usually add 3 whole eggs and 2 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.390
 egg whites can break all eggs 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 wholly 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.600
 however, we are already quite saturated 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 fat 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.160
 then I add tomato and dill 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.530
 ground blender and now bye 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.340
 scrambled eggs don't need to be carefully 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.340
 to mix everything 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.940
 now we add spices to taste 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.350
 this dish I prefer oregano 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.210
 chilli granulated garlic cayenne 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 chili peppers and chalapeno peppers and 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.710
 next step I add finely 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.160
 sliced â€‹â€‹ham and cheese 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.410
 slice 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.610
 it will melt anyway and now here 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.050
 this case we briefly cover the lid 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.210
 the readiness rate of the dish is cheese 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.370
 when it melted you can still once more all 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.370
 mix and spread on a plate and 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.280
 before serving dish generously 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.660
 pour it with lemon juice it 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 definitely give to our dish 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.369
 zest today we have prepared 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.750
 high-calorie fried eggs which 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.880
 perfectly fit into a diet for 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
 massabonora though our dish and not 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.660

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.910
 calorie and really help
