square<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> goes<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> i<00:01:28.560> recommend

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
square and so it goes to the i recommend

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
square and so it goes to the i recommend
the<00:01:29.220> SMG<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> does<00:01:30.180> kill<00:01:30.450> faster<00:01:30.689> as

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the SMG because it does kill faster as

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.630
