00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
hi guys Nathan Borden here again with

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.029 
hi guys Nathan Borden here again with
another<00:00:06.790> tutorial<00:00:07.740> today<00:00:08.740> we're<00:00:09.190> looking<00:00:09.309> at

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
another tutorial today we're looking at

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.949 
another tutorial today we're looking at
triggering<00:00:12.039> a<00:00:12.369> sine<00:00:12.670> wave<00:00:12.910> with<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:13.690> kick<00:00:13.930> drum

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
triggering a sine wave with a kick drum

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.070 
triggering a sine wave with a kick drum
to<00:00:14.410> give<00:00:14.799> it<00:00:14.889> a<00:00:14.949> bit<00:00:15.100> more<00:00:15.129> depth<00:00:15.810> you<00:00:16.810> can<00:00:16.960> do

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
to give it a bit more depth you can do

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.410 
to give it a bit more depth you can do
this<00:00:17.260> with<00:00:17.440> either<00:00:17.560> MIDI<00:00:18.070> drums<00:00:18.460> or<00:00:19.090> live

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
this with either MIDI drums or live

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.010 
this with either MIDI drums or live
drums<00:00:19.750> I'll<00:00:20.050> be<00:00:20.170> using<00:00:20.320> MIDI<00:00:20.620> drums<00:00:20.860> today

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
drums I'll be using MIDI drums today

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920 
drums I'll be using MIDI drums today
again<00:00:23.020> I'm<00:00:23.140> using<00:00:23.230> Logic<00:00:23.650> Pro<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.570> you<00:00:25.690> can<00:00:25.810> do

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
again I'm using Logic Pro but you can do

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.870 
again I'm using Logic Pro but you can do
this<00:00:26.080> in<00:00:26.230> Pro<00:00:26.440> Tools<00:00:26.470> Cubase<00:00:27.310> whatever<00:00:27.760> you've

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
this in Pro Tools Cubase whatever you've

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.980 
this in Pro Tools Cubase whatever you've
got<00:00:29.280> so<00:00:30.280> let's<00:00:30.460> have<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.580> listen<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.810> beat

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
got so let's have a listen to the beat

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:45.870 
got so let's have a listen to the beat
that<00:00:32.020> we've<00:00:32.289> got<00:00:32.439> it's<00:00:32.590> just<00:00:32.770> 1<00:00:33.010> bar<00:00:33.190> loop<00:00:44.880> it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
that we've got it's just 1 bar loop it's

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.479 
that we've got it's just 1 bar loop it's
quite<00:00:46.060> a<00:00:46.090> beefy<00:00:46.390> kick<00:00:46.570> drum<00:00:46.750> anyway<00:00:47.050> um<00:00:47.489> but

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
quite a beefy kick drum anyway um but

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.160 
quite a beefy kick drum anyway um but
we'll<00:00:48.670> add<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.940> sine<00:00:49.149> wave<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:49.540> just<00:00:50.079> for

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
we'll add the sine wave to it just for

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.210 
we'll add the sine wave to it just for
the<00:00:50.230> purposes<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.770> this<00:00:50.970> so<00:00:51.970> first<00:00:52.360> thing

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
the purposes of this so first thing

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.470 
the purposes of this so first thing
let's<00:00:54.220> send<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.610> out<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.760> bus<00:00:55.180> 1<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:58.270> going<00:00:58.390> to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
let's send it out to bus 1 I'm going to

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.530 
let's send it out to bus 1 I'm going to
click<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.840> hold<00:00:58.870> where<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.350> says<00:00:59.500> bus<00:00:59.739> 1<00:01:00.540> get

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
click and hold where it says bus 1 get

click and hold where it says bus 1 get
pre-fader<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:04.540> then<00:01:04.809> we're<00:01:04.899> gonna<00:01:04.989> hold<00:01:05.560> alt

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
pre-fader and then we're gonna hold alt

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.249 
pre-fader and then we're gonna hold alt
or<00:01:06.189> option<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:07.240> click<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.659> this<00:01:07.810> little<00:01:08.049> knob

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and I'll send out this area

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.709 
and I'll send out this area
so<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:12.670> all<00:01:12.789> cuz<00:01:12.969> it's<00:01:13.149> created<00:01:13.479> for<00:01:13.630> us

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
so this all cuz it's created for us

so this all cuz it's created for us
we're<00:01:13.899> gonna<00:01:13.959> rename<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.789> and<00:01:15.789> we'll<00:01:16.030> call

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
we're gonna rename that and we'll call

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.099 
we're gonna rename that and we'll call
that<00:01:18.149> kick<00:01:19.149> sub<00:01:21.240> ok<00:01:22.240> next<00:01:22.779> thing<00:01:22.869> we're<00:01:23.049> gonna

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
that kick sub ok next thing we're gonna

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.340 
that kick sub ok next thing we're gonna
do<00:01:23.350> on<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:24.429> second<00:01:24.880> little<00:01:25.869> channel<00:01:26.319> here

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
do on the second little channel here

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.989 
do on the second little channel here
second<00:01:27.279> insert<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.990> gonna<00:01:29.170> put<00:01:29.499> like<00:01:30.490> noise

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
second insert we're gonna put like noise

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.440 
second insert we're gonna put like noise
gate<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.520> going<00:01:33.639> to<00:01:33.670> use<00:01:33.849> logics<00:01:34.240> noise

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
gate I'm just going to use logics noise

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.639 
gate I'm just going to use logics noise
game<00:01:34.829> stereo<00:01:36.689> turn<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.810> threshold<00:01:38.229> all<00:01:38.499> the

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
game stereo turn the threshold all the

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
way up for now where it says sidechain

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.379 
way up for now where it says sidechain
at<00:01:42.849> the<00:01:42.939> top<00:01:43.289> I'm<00:01:44.289> gonna<00:01:44.469> click<00:01:44.679> on<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.389> and

going to come down to utility test
oscillator<00:02:02.729> I'm<00:02:03.729> gonna<00:02:03.880> leave<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.329> in<00:02:04.419> sine

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:04.779 
oscillator I'm gonna leave it in sine

oscillator I'm gonna leave it in sine
wave<00:02:04.989> mode<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.770> we're<00:02:06.520> gonna<00:02:06.609> double<00:02:06.909> click

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
wave mode and we're gonna double click

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.449 
wave mode and we're gonna double click
here<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.450> we'll<00:02:07.569> turn<00:02:07.719> it<00:02:07.869> down<00:02:07.989> to<00:02:08.229> about<00:02:08.590> 41

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
here and we'll turn it down to about 41

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.650 
here and we'll turn it down to about 41
Hertz<00:02:10.590> which<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.820> really<00:02:12.820> quite<00:02:13.120> low<00:02:13.360> sup

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
Hertz which is really quite low sup

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.120 
Hertz which is really quite low sup
you're<00:02:13.900> really<00:02:14.110> gonna<00:02:14.200> feel<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.830> club

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
you're really gonna feel that in a club

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.300 
you're really gonna feel that in a club
or<00:02:15.370> through<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> big<00:02:16.390> PA
