that technological approach that one

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.310 
that technological approach that one
takes<00:01:48.430> into<00:01:48.640> school<00:01:49.030> our<00:01:49.510> students<00:01:50.020> begin

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
takes into school our students begin

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.670 
takes into school our students begin
programming<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:51.220> sixth<00:01:51.430> grade

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
programming in sixth grade

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
programming in sixth grade
and<00:01:52.770> each<00:01:53.100> year<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.670> attend<00:01:54.300> global<00:01:54.840> r<00:01:54.960> class

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and each year they attend global r class

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.290 
and each year they attend global r class
so<00:01:56.100> they're<00:01:56.370> building<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> skills<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
so they're building on the skills that

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.480 
so they're building on the skills that
they<00:01:57.480> learn<00:01:57.690> previous<00:01:58.350> year<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.340> use

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
they learn previous year you have to use

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.320 
they learn previous year you have to use
like<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.360> codes<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.900> gravity<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
like the codes for gravity and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
acceleration such like them and math

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.960 
acceleration such like them and math
variables<00:02:06.840> numbers<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.950> learned<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.729> lot<00:02:08.820> of
