00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you put the wings down you just press r1

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.600 
you put the wings down you just press r1
while<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.390> drag<00:01:06.630> racing<00:01:07.080> end<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:08.220> puts

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
while your drag racing end it it puts

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.719 
while your drag racing end it it puts
the<00:01:08.850> downforce<00:01:09.840> away<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> lot<00:01:11.700> more
