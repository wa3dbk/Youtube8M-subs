00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
later we were just chosen at random and

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.350 
later we were just chosen at random and
then<00:04:53.900> made<00:04:54.110> into<00:04:54.560> what<00:04:54.710> we<00:04:54.830> are<00:04:54.860> now<00:04:55.240> what<00:04:56.240> if

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
then made into what we are now what if

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.060 
then made into what we are now what if
we<00:04:56.510> were<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:58.400> thought<00:04:58.700> doesn't<00:04:59.120> bother<00:04:59.240> you

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
it's just not that big a deal really

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.310 
it's just not that big a deal really
how<00:05:04.730> we<00:05:04.790> were<00:05:05.030> born<00:05:05.300> into<00:05:05.480> this<00:05:05.660> world<00:05:05.720> doesn't

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
how we were born into this world doesn't

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.379 
how we were born into this world doesn't
matter<00:05:06.669> it's<00:05:07.669> what<00:05:07.850> we<00:05:07.970> do<00:05:08.120> with<00:05:08.270> ourselves

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389
