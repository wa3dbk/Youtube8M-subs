any settings the settings should be fine

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
any settings the settings should be fine
by<00:01:43.979> default<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:44.939> ahead<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> press<00:01:45.390> GO

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
by default just go ahead and press GO

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.370 
by default just go ahead and press GO
and<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.450> green<00:01:48.750> prompt<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and now we get a little green prompt and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
and now we get a little green prompt and
if<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.619> prompt<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> red<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.180> has<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> red

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
if your prompt is red if it has a red

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
if your prompt is red if it has a red
background<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.259> instead<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> green

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
background right here instead of green

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.270 
background right here instead of green
then<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.329> means<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.680> likely<00:01:56.070> than

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
then what this means is more likely than

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
then what this means is more likely than
not<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> your<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.719> probably<00:01:58.110> typed

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
not some of your you probably typed

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.980 
not some of your you probably typed
something<00:01:58.740> wrong<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.399> code<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.780> ahead

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
something wrong in your code so go ahead

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.859 
something wrong in your code so go ahead
in<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.860> sure<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.189> source<00:02:02.490> code<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.060> exactly

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
in make sure your source code is exactly

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.350 
in make sure your source code is exactly
the<00:02:04.469> same<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.799> mine<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> I'll<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.119> file

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the same as mine and I'll have this file

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.900 
the same as mine and I'll have this file
available<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.200> guys<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:08.099> forum<00:02:08.550> once

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
available to you guys on my forum once

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
available to you guys on my forum once
I'm<00:02:09.060> done<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.660> tutorials<00:02:09.860> but

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I'm done with all these tutorials but

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.030 
I'm done with all these tutorials but
anyways<00:02:11.660> now<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.260> ahead<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.530> click

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
anyways now if we go ahead and click

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.490 
anyways now if we go ahead and click
your<00:02:14.220> database<00:02:14.610> name<00:02:14.640> again<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.170> choose

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
your database name again and you choose

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.460 
your database name again and you choose
structure<00:02:17.370> then<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.840> our

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
structure then you can see that our

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.580 
structure then you can see that our
table<00:02:19.950> was<00:02:20.370> imported<00:02:21.030> successfully<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
table was imported successfully and the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.319 
table was imported successfully and the
cool<00:02:22.739> thing<00:02:22.980> about<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.640> whenever<00:02:24.060> you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
cool thing about this is whenever you

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.410 
cool thing about this is whenever you
have<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> file<00:02:25.610> what<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.849> do<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.299> can

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
have a file what you can do is you can

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.300 
have a file what you can do is you can
just<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.780> ahead<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.200> give<00:02:28.349> your<00:02:28.439> friend<00:02:28.829> this

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
just go ahead and give your friend this

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.250 
just go ahead and give your friend this
file<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.939> then<00:02:30.329> they<00:02:30.510> don't<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> create

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
file and then they don't have to create

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.259 
file and then they don't have to create
the<00:02:31.470> table<00:02:31.650> manually<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.579> if<00:02:32.819> you're<00:02:33.030> working

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
the table manually or if you're working

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.300 
the table manually or if you're working
with<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.690> know<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.989> team<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.530> developers<00:02:34.739> or

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
with you know a team of developers or

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.339 
with you know a team of developers or
something<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.390> why<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.629> like<00:02:37.049> making

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
something so that's why I like making

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.339 
something so that's why I like making
all<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.709> these<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.220> SQL<00:02:38.730> files<00:02:39.000> rather<00:02:39.930> than

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
all of these in SQL files rather than

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.229 
all of these in SQL files rather than
you<00:02:40.799> know<00:02:40.829> just<00:02:40.950> doing<00:02:41.310> everything<00:02:41.790> manually

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
you know just doing everything manually

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.789 
you know just doing everything manually
in<00:02:42.659> phpMyAdmin

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
in phpMyAdmin

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.490 
in phpMyAdmin
but<00:02:44.519> now<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> important<00:02:45.390> part<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:46.260> now

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
but now the important part is we now

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.550 
but now the important part is we now
have<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.829> table<00:02:47.459> created<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.269> our<00:02:48.870> database<00:02:49.290> in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
have a table created in our database in

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.300 
have a table created in our database in
the<00:02:49.709> table<00:02:50.129> name<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.269> chat<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.190> go

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the table name is chat so now we can go

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.160 
the table name is chat so now we can go
ahead<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.700> add<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.000> messages<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> table

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
ahead and add the messages to the table

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.199 
ahead and add the messages to the table
and<00:02:55.349> just<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.950> recap<00:02:56.129> one<00:02:56.489> last<00:02:56.639> time<00:02:56.879> so<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
and just to recap one last time so you

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.789 
and just to recap one last time so you
guys<00:02:57.569> don't<00:02:57.720> get<00:02:57.840> confused<00:02:58.049> whenever<00:02:58.650> we're

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
guys don't get confused whenever we're

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.069 
guys don't get confused whenever we're
coding<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.310> thing<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.970> has<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> message<00:03:00.810> ID

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
coding this thing it has a message ID

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.440 
coding this thing it has a message ID
which<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.069> pretty<00:03:02.370> much<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.700> ID<00:03:02.819> number<00:03:03.269> of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
which is pretty much the ID number of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.020 
which is pretty much the ID number of
each<00:03:03.659> message<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.859> message<00:03:04.889> is<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.400> one

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
each message and a message is just one

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.180 
each message and a message is just one
thing<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.450> user<00:03:06.599> types<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.200> post<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.069> on

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
thing that the user types a post it on

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.640 
thing that the user types a post it on
so<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.519> saves<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.359> time<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.379> date<00:03:10.620> that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
so it saves the time and the date that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.339 
so it saves the time and the date that
it's<00:03:11.069> posted<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:12.239> username<00:03:12.810> which<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.049> either

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
it's posted the username which is either

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.129 
it's posted the username which is either
you<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.739> Bucky<00:03:14.129> or<00:03:14.310> guest<00:03:14.639> 88<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.750> message

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
you know Bucky or guest 88 the message

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.960 
you know Bucky or guest 88 the message
itself<00:03:16.680> which<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> text<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.609> hey<00:03:17.760> what's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
itself which is the text like hey what's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.770 
itself which is the text like hey what's
going<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.299> STFU<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.400> color<00:03:20.669> and<00:03:21.030> also<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
going on STFU or the color and also the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.530 
going on STFU or the color and also the
color<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.590> text<00:03:22.859> itself<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.419> can

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
color of the text itself so it can

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.270 
color of the text itself so it can
actually<00:03:24.870> close<00:03:25.290> out<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.889> browser

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
actually close out of this browser

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.339 
actually close out of this browser
because<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.120> we<00:03:27.239> don't<00:03:27.359> need<00:03:27.569> anything

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
because you know we don't need anything
