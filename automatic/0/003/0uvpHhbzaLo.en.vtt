bit unique to get to which I like and it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.270 
bit unique to get to which I like and it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
particular order because each of them

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
particular order because each of them
could<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.610> better<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:57.149> worse<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.660> really

and<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.080> go<00:01:40.260> all<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.800> up<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.580> this<00:01:41.700> little

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and we go all the way up to this little

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:53.330 
and we go all the way up to this little
waterfall<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:51.979> once<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.190> here

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
waterfall over here once you get here

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
waterfall over here once you get here
like<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.640> said<00:01:53.670> I'm<00:01:54.240> gonna<00:01:54.570> unselect<00:01:55.170> something

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
like I said I'm gonna unselect something

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
like I said I'm gonna unselect something
so<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.800> way<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.490> bit<00:01:56.790> faster<00:01:59.210> once

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
so that way this is a bit faster once

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
so that way this is a bit faster once
again<00:02:00.509> you're<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> need<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.440> crow<00:02:01.830> bike

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
you could say in terms of it being well

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.310 
you could say in terms of it being well
on<00:04:11.160> an<00:04:11.490> island<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.450> having<00:04:12.750> its<00:04:12.870> own<00:04:12.960> super

base so secret meadow secret islets
somewhere<00:04:17.820> over<00:04:18.030> here<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:18.750> actually<00:04:19.560> never

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
somewhere over here so actually never

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.990 
somewhere over here so actually never
been<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:19.920> this<00:04:20.130> before<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.640> I'm<00:04:20.700> talking<00:04:20.970> about

been to this before so I'm talking about

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.050 
been to this before so I'm talking about
126<00:04:21.690> shouldn't<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.230> too<00:04:22.650> difficult<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.880> get<00:04:24.030> to

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
126 shouldn't be too difficult to get to

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:34.960 
126 shouldn't be too difficult to get to
hopefully<00:04:24.690> not

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.010 

of<00:04:35.970> course<00:04:36.180> you're<00:04:36.270> going<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.420> need<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.570> Pokemon

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
of course you're going to need a Pokemon

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.640 
of course you're going to need a Pokemon
dive<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:37.860> order<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.280> get<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.760> place<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.650> so

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
dive in order to get to this place so so

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:50.980 
dive in order to get to this place so so
keep<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:40.950> important<00:04:43.820> feeling<00:04:44.820> somewhere

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.640 

somewhere<00:04:51.990> over<00:04:52.290> here<00:04:53.870> just<00:04:54.870> diamonds<00:04:55.110> and

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
somewhere over here just diamonds and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.420 
somewhere over here just diamonds and
see<00:04:55.800> what<00:04:55.890> we<00:04:56.010> find

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
see what we find

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:07.580 
see what we find
I<00:05:05.390> guess<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.540> only<00:05:06.690> downside<00:05:07.140> about<00:05:07.380> this

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
I guess the only downside about this

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.160 
I guess the only downside about this
secret<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.970> secret<00:05:09.360> base<00:05:09.480> is<00:05:09.750> that's<00:05:09.990> not

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
secret of the secret base is that's not

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.020 
secret of the secret base is that's not
really<00:05:10.380> spacious<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:11.310> mean<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.670> a<00:05:11.700> little

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
really spacious I mean it is a little

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.520 
really spacious I mean it is a little
bit<00:05:12.180> but<00:05:12.510> it's<00:05:12.660> not<00:05:12.720> really<00:05:13.020> unique<00:05:13.320> or

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
bit but it's not really unique or

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.580 
bit but it's not really unique or
anything<00:05:13.710> by<00:05:13.950> that<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.990> still<00:05:16.290> looks<00:05:16.500> pretty

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
anything by that it still looks pretty

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:29.090 
anything by that it still looks pretty
cool<00:05:19.970> looks<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.150> be<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.360> wrong<00:05:21.480> one<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:28.100> note

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
cool looks to be the wrong one I note

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.010 
cool looks to be the wrong one I note
somewhere<00:05:29.520> over<00:05:29.700> here<00:05:29.730> it's<00:05:30.120> somewhere<00:05:30.750> where

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
somewhere over here it's somewhere where

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.770 
somewhere over here it's somewhere where
we<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.470> dive<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:32.610> order<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.210> get<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.600> the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
we have to dive in order to get to the

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:54.620 
we have to dive in order to get to the
secret<00:05:34.050> islet

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.780 

all<00:05:55.630> right<00:05:55.810> one<00:05:56.020> second

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
all right one second

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.860 
all right one second
all<00:05:57.790> right<00:05:57.910> so<00:05:58.030> it's<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.180> little<00:05:58.240> bit<00:05:58.540> off<00:05:58.660> it's

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
all right so it's a little bit off it's

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.320 
all right so it's a little bit off it's
actually<00:05:59.200> in<00:05:59.260> the<00:05:59.350> southeastern<00:06:00.220> corner<00:06:00.330> here

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
actually in the southeastern corner here

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.220 
actually in the southeastern corner here
so<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.630> have<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:01.960> do<00:06:02.140> is<00:06:02.800> hit<00:06:03.010> dive<00:06:04.230> it's

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
so I have to do is hit dive it's

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.320 
so I have to do is hit dive it's
honestly<00:06:05.800> not<00:06:05.950> very<00:06:06.310> difficult<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.850> get<00:06:06.970> to<00:06:07.030> it

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
honestly not very difficult to get to it

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.290 
honestly not very difficult to get to it
all<00:06:07.510> which<00:06:08.350> again<00:06:09.250> makes<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:09.760> easy<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:12.300> also

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
all which again makes it easy and also

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.120 
all which again makes it easy and also
not<00:06:13.600> as<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:14.080> interest<00:06:14.470> I<00:06:14.530> guess<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.830> could<00:06:14.950> say

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
not as of interest I guess you could say

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.970 
not as of interest I guess you could say
but<00:06:15.510> dive<00:06:16.510> up<00:06:16.720> from<00:06:16.930> here<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:17.650> then<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:17.890> have

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
but dive up from here and then you have

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.430 
but dive up from here and then you have
to<00:06:18.100> surf<00:06:18.280> all<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:19.330> way<00:06:19.450> down<00:06:19.630> here<00:06:20.050> and<00:06:20.200> then

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
to surf all the way down here and then

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.330 
to surf all the way down here and then
actually<00:06:21.090> is<00:06:22.090> right<00:06:22.750> here<00:06:23.110> again<00:06:23.920> it's<00:06:24.220> on

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
actually is right here again it's on

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.250 
actually is right here again it's on
it's<00:06:24.520> on<00:06:24.580> island<00:06:25.090> looks<00:06:25.510> cool<00:06:25.750> I<00:06:25.990> guess<00:06:26.170> you

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
it's on island looks cool I guess you

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.340 
it's on island looks cool I guess you
could<00:06:26.380> say<00:06:26.910> has<00:06:27.910> bushes<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:28.600> whatnot<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.020> it's

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
could say has bushes and whatnot so it's

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.800 
could say has bushes and whatnot so it's
kind<00:06:29.500> of<00:06:29.530> like<00:06:29.680> your<00:06:29.830> own<00:06:29.860> paradise<00:06:30.580> but<00:06:30.940> again

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
kind of like your own paradise but again

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.840 
kind of like your own paradise but again
it<00:06:31.930> looks<00:06:32.020> like<00:06:32.200> more<00:06:32.440> like<00:06:32.470> a<00:06:32.740> resort<00:06:33.130> or<00:06:33.580> like

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
it looks like more like a resort or like

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.060
