00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.470
 Hmm 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.380
 Well 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.970
 As a knack for doing arts first 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.300
 Speaking of 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.100
 At first we added the graininess of eight heads well 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.610
 It is not an aircraft 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.310
 Because 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.250
 When 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.010
 I 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.250
 Always 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:34.460
 Connor 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:38.440
 I'm trying to reverse the bottom and top and make the top hat heavy 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.440
 Then Tsubudachi is became well 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.809
 very well 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.480
 Half open 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:53.140
 Firmly gone to the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.140
 It feels like it closes nicely 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750
 so 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.280
 8 head as the bone to bone 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.300
 If you tighten it well 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.300
 Not to take 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 Hmm 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.770
 It is something to the purpose filter 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.010
 Pretty much from the first shot 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.860
 Hit with full power from the first shot 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.610
 par 4 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 tee 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.720
 Reggae is 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.910
 Speaking of one drop 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.910
 I have been to Nehata, but 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.500
 Or say what is one drop and one drop one love 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.500
 Well 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:26.450
 One shot one shot 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:30.870
 Only the mind is the mind that is going to cherish one shot and one shot with power 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:36.569
 Rasta is a reggae musician 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 I say to beat with love in one shot one shot 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.790
 The one bang bang drop Hangaa tool 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.160
 Since the data do not think Well it is the next child 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 To the one shot 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.630
 Let's say I 'll put in a rug 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.630
 It is feeling 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 A little bit of a house 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.750
 Fill 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.880
 I have skirts but I often do 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.380
 that 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.370
 Because pattern became late and became cash register 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 Historically 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.140

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.140
 By skipping the head say 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:41.680
 From the head of the next bar to say fast Yes Rutte 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:44.250
 Good reggae power 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.250
