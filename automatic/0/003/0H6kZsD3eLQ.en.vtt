00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and to put our wire into our jump ring

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
and to put our wire into our jump ring
or<00:01:03.030> we're<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.900> go<00:01:04.019> ahead<00:01:04.049> and

or we're actually going to go ahead and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.420 
or we're actually going to go ahead and
switch<00:01:04.829> one<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.189> our<00:01:05.339> ends<00:01:06.890> or<00:01:07.890> make<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> lot<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
switch one of our ends or make a lot of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.819 
switch one of our ends or make a lot of
noise<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.149> say<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.710> have

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
noise so I like to say so we have

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.109 
noise so I like to say so we have
flattened<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> our<00:01:11.579> heads<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.000> you'll

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
flattened one of our heads and you'll

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.330 
flattened one of our heads and you'll
see<00:01:12.299> why<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.900> second<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
see why in just a second we're going to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.430 
see why in just a second we're going to
come<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.729> our<00:01:14.790> jump<00:01:15.060> runner<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.260> we're

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
come over to our jump runner and we're

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.920 
come over to our jump runner and we're
going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.620> place<00:01:16.830> our<00:01:16.979> mandrel<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
going to place our mandrel in here and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.480 
going to place our mandrel in here and
turn<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> down<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.979> tightens

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.740 

before<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.550> get<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.790> completely<00:01:26.180> tight<00:01:26.510> I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
before I get it completely tight I

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.210 
before I get it completely tight I
actually<00:01:26.960> want<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.260> take<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:27.560> platen<00:01:27.980> to<00:01:28.100> end

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
actually want to take this platen to end

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.640 
actually want to take this platen to end
of<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.580> brass<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.600> want<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:29.960> put<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.230> in<00:01:30.440> so

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
of the brass and I want to put it in so

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.680 
of the brass and I want to put it in so
it<00:01:30.770> gets<00:01:30.950> underneath<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.730> teeth<00:01:31.910> and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
it gets underneath one of the teeth and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.730 
it gets underneath one of the teeth and
then<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.170> can<00:01:33.350> tighten<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:36.350> hopefully<00:01:36.560> I

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
then I can tighten it and hopefully I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.080 
then I can tighten it and hopefully I
get<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:36.980> in<00:01:37.190> there<00:01:37.340> perfectly<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:37.970> it's

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
get that in there perfectly so it's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.650 
get that in there perfectly so it's
going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.360> turn<00:01:38.710> nicely<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.670> we're<00:01:41.150> also<00:01:41.360> going

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
going to turn nicely so we're also going

to put on a glove because we found the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.400 
to put on a glove because we found the
hard<00:01:43.820> way<00:01:43.970> that<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.300> can<00:01:44.510> really<00:01:44.750> slice<00:01:45.260> up

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
hard way that you can really slice up

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.030 
hard way that you can really slice up
your<00:01:45.530> fingers<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:47.150> with<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.320> glove<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.770> I'm

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
going to go ahead and turn my jump ring

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.060 
going to go ahead and turn my jump ring
er<00:01:52.480> so<00:01:53.480> that<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.720> can<00:01:53.900> see<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.590> have<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
er so that you can see that I have the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.660 
er so that you can see that I have the
brass<00:01:55.390> going<00:01:56.390> pretty<00:01:56.600> taut<00:01:57.130> one<00:01:58.130> next<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
brass going pretty taut one next to the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.800 
brass going pretty taut one next to the
next<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.420> it's<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.780> nice<00:02:00.020> uniform<00:02:00.680> coil<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.940> I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
next so it's a nice uniform coil and I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.050 
next so it's a nice uniform coil and I
will<00:02:02.960> take<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.440> all<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.740> way<00:02:04.010> till<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.820> end

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
will take this all the way till the end

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.360 
will take this all the way till the end
till<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.360> run<00:02:05.540> out<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.720> wire<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.950> comes<00:02:07.220> in

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
till I run out of wire this comes in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.949

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
going to tighten it up so it's going to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.370 
going to tighten it up so it's going to
be<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.620> there<00:03:03.740> nice<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.220> tight<00:03:04.430> now<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:06.230> can

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
be in there nice and tight now you can

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:15.130 
be in there nice and tight now you can
start<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.800> with<00:03:06.950> your<00:03:07.070> fingers<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:10.540> say<00:03:11.540> that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.930 

once<00:03:15.740> we<00:03:15.860> get<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.310> by<00:03:16.490> our<00:03:16.610> fingers

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
once we get it in there by our fingers

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.460 
once we get it in there by our fingers
pretty<00:03:17.150> tight<00:03:17.480> we're<00:03:17.900> going<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.080> go<00:03:18.170> ahead<00:03:18.350> and

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
pretty tight we're going to go ahead and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.720 
pretty tight we're going to go ahead and
tighten<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.710> up<00:03:18.800> with<00:03:18.860> our<00:03:19.100> allen<00:03:19.400> wrench<00:03:19.580> as

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
tighten it up with our allen wrench as

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.980 
tighten it up with our allen wrench as
well<00:03:19.910> because<00:03:20.240> we<00:03:20.330> don't<00:03:20.510> want<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.900> go

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.350 
well because we don't want this to go
anywhere<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.500> our<00:03:22.310> allen<00:03:22.700> wrench<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.060> going<00:03:23.270> to

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
anywhere so our allen wrench is going to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.910 
anywhere so our allen wrench is going to
make<00:03:23.750> sure<00:03:23.960> that<00:03:23.990> this<00:03:24.260> little<00:03:24.410> guy<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.710> not

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
make sure that this little guy is not

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:37.820 
make sure that this little guy is not
going<00:03:25.190> anywhere

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.530 

and<00:03:38.340> we're<00:03:38.550> not<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:38.910> anywhere<00:03:39.120> you'll<00:03:39.360> see

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
and we're not going anywhere you'll see

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.210 
and we're not going anywhere you'll see
that<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.380> there<00:03:40.590> really<00:03:41.190> tightly<00:03:43.220> so

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that that is in there really tightly so

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.800 
that that is in there really tightly so
now<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:44.610> he's<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.030> here<00:03:45.270> we're<00:03:45.510> going<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.720> go

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
now that he's in here we're going to go

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.390 
now that he's in here we're going to go
ahead<00:03:45.960> we've<00:03:46.230> already<00:03:46.440> set<00:03:46.770> up<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.920> flex

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
ahead we've already set up the flex

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.220 
ahead we've already set up the flex
shaft<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:48.390> gotten<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.870> cutting

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
shaft so that it's gotten the cutting

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.050 
shaft so that it's gotten the cutting
tool<00:03:49.410> on<00:03:49.650> there<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.340> you'll<00:03:50.520> see<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.910> this

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
tool on there so you'll see that this

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.150 
tool on there so you'll see that this
flex<00:03:51.360> shaft<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.840> set<00:03:52.140> up<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.440> perfectly<00:03:52.710> will

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
flex shaft is set up so perfectly will

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.000 
flex shaft is set up so perfectly will
fit<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.610> here<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> blade<00:03:54.560> going<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.800> cut

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
fit in here with the blade going to cut

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.730 
fit in here with the blade going to cut
right<00:03:56.670> through<00:03:56.700> those<00:03:57.180> jump<00:03:57.540> rings<00:03:57.780> now<00:03:58.530> this

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
right through those jump rings now this

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.860 
right through those jump rings now this
takes<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.250> motor<00:03:59.790> that's<00:04:00.090> pretty<00:04:00.360> strong<00:04:00.660> we

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
takes a motor that's pretty strong we

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.210 
takes a motor that's pretty strong we
tried<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.230> earlier<00:04:01.410> with<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.860> motor<00:04:02.130> that

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
tried this earlier with a motor that

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.190 
tried this earlier with a motor that
wasn't<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:02.790> good<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.300> didn't<00:04:03.600> work<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:03.780> we

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
wasn't so good and it didn't work so we

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.960 
wasn't so good and it didn't work so we
needed<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> stronger<00:04:04.920> motor<00:04:05.100> but<00:04:05.610> you'll<00:04:05.730> see

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
needed the stronger motor but you'll see

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.000 
needed the stronger motor but you'll see
when<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.270> hit<00:04:06.480> this<00:04:06.720> it'll<00:04:06.960> actually<00:04:07.620> you'll

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
when I hit this it'll actually you'll

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.680 
when I hit this it'll actually you'll
see<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.340> all<00:04:08.550> going<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.330> we're<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.630> go

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
see this all going and we're going to go

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.940 
see this all going and we're going to go
ahead<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.900> put<00:04:09.990> some<00:04:10.020> lubrication<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.740> this

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
ahead and put some lubrication on this

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.130 
ahead and put some lubrication on this
because<00:04:11.910> it'll<00:04:12.180> make<00:04:12.270> life<00:04:12.330> a<00:04:12.510> little<00:04:12.720> easier

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
because it'll make life a little easier

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.340 
because it'll make life a little easier
so<00:04:13.640> we're<00:04:14.640> going<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.790> go<00:04:14.970> ahead<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.570> place<00:04:16.080> our

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
so we're going to go ahead and place our

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.680 
so we're going to go ahead and place our
saw<00:04:16.860> in<00:04:17.130> there<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.970> we're<00:04:18.090> going<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.239> start<00:04:18.510> it

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
saw in there and we're going to start it

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.840 
saw in there and we're going to start it
up<00:04:18.750> without<00:04:19.049> going<00:04:19.350> anywhere<00:04:19.560> first<00:04:19.890> I'm<00:04:20.790> just

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
up without going anywhere first I'm just

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.850 
up without going anywhere first I'm just
building<00:04:21.209> up<00:04:21.450> momentum<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.110> I<00:04:22.200> get<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> good

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
building up momentum so I get to a good

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.890 
building up momentum so I get to a good
speed<00:04:23.190> what<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.060> feel<00:04:24.330> like<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.600> at<00:04:24.750> this

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
speed what I feel like that at this

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.150 
speed what I feel like that at this
speed<00:04:25.200> I'm<00:04:25.380> going<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.590> go<00:04:25.680> ahead<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.980> zip

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
speed I'm going to go ahead and zip

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.980 
speed I'm going to go ahead and zip
through<00:04:26.400> everything<00:04:26.850> hopefully<00:04:27.150> quickly<00:04:27.660> and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
through everything hopefully quickly and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.960 
through everything hopefully quickly and
you<00:04:28.050> might<00:04:28.230> see<00:04:28.410> some<00:04:28.620> smoke<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.610> let's<00:04:29.790> go

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
you might see some smoke so let's go

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:38.399 
you might see some smoke so let's go
ahead

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:46.480 

a<00:04:39.539> lot<00:04:40.539> of<00:04:40.689> jumprings

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.550 

now<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> cut<00:04:47.850> through<00:04:48.030> everything<00:04:48.440> let's<00:04:49.440> go

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
now I cut through everything let's go

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.920 
now I cut through everything let's go
ahead<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.090> loosen<00:04:51.090> this<00:04:51.210> up<00:04:51.389> now<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.600> can<00:04:51.780> tell

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
ahead and loosen this up now I can tell

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.230 
ahead and loosen this up now I can tell
you<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.050> buggers<00:04:52.350> hot<00:04:52.699> as<00:04:53.699> I<00:04:53.850> could<00:04:54.000> see<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
you this buggers hot as I could see the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.770 
you this buggers hot as I could see the
smoke<00:04:54.479> coming<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.820> we'll<00:04:57.240> see<00:04:57.419> if<00:04:57.510> we<00:04:57.540> cut

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
smoke coming so we'll see if we cut

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.090 
smoke coming so we'll see if we cut
through<00:04:57.930> everything<00:04:58.199> it<00:04:58.440> felt<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.979> went

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
through everything it felt like it went

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.580 
through everything it felt like it went
through<00:04:59.220> everything<00:04:59.550> but<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.970> never<00:05:00.120> know<00:05:00.300> so

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
through everything but you never know so

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.150 
through everything but you never know so
we'll<00:05:01.590> loosen<00:05:01.740> up<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.130> little<00:05:02.160> bit<00:05:02.490> at<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.639> time

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.050 

check<00:05:08.850> this<00:05:09.000> one<00:05:09.060> out<00:05:09.270> completely<00:05:10.910> once<00:05:11.910> again

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
check this one out completely once again

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.420 
check this one out completely once again
I'm<00:05:12.560> worried<00:05:13.560> is<00:05:13.680> going<00:05:13.980> enough<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.280> can

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
I'm worried is going enough you can

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.970 
I'm worried is going enough you can
actually<00:05:14.580> do<00:05:14.790> with<00:05:14.910> your<00:05:15.000> fingers

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.700 

and<00:05:20.790> look<00:05:21.050> they<00:05:22.050> look<00:05:22.260> like<00:05:22.410> they're<00:05:22.620> all

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
and look they look like they're all

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.560 
and look they look like they're all
stuck<00:05:22.980> together<00:05:23.160> that's<00:05:23.880> because<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.300> sort<00:05:24.480> of

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
stuck together that's because I sort of

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.770 
stuck together that's because I sort of
melded<00:05:24.900> together<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.920> in<00:05:26.130> actuality<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:27.570> hit

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
melded together but in actuality you hit

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.020 
melded together but in actuality you hit
it<00:05:27.870> with<00:05:27.960> your<00:05:27.990> fingernail<00:05:28.470> you'll<00:05:28.740> see

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
it with your fingernail you'll see

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.300 
it with your fingernail you'll see
they're<00:05:30.030> all<00:05:30.150> individually<00:05:30.960> cut<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:32.190> you've

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
they're all individually cut so you've

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.740 
they're all individually cut so you've
got<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> bunch<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.850> jump<00:05:33.060> rings<00:05:33.180> looks<00:05:33.510> really

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
got a bunch of jump rings looks really

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.180 
got a bunch of jump rings looks really
pretty<00:05:33.960> this<00:05:34.110> way<00:05:34.260> too<00:05:34.320> but<00:05:34.950> they<00:05:35.040> actually

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
pretty this way too but they actually

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.580 
pretty this way too but they actually
are<00:05:35.520> all<00:05:35.700> cut<00:05:35.940> it's<00:05:36.930> just<00:05:37.170> that<00:05:37.290> they've<00:05:37.410> kind

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
are all cut it's just that they've kind

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.200 
are all cut it's just that they've kind
of<00:05:37.710> stuck<00:05:37.950> together<00:05:38.100> but<00:05:38.730> you've<00:05:39.030> got<00:05:39.180> a

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
of stuck together but you've got a

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.360 
of stuck together but you've got a
zillion<00:05:39.510> little<00:05:39.630> jump<00:05:39.990> rings<00:05:40.230> so<00:05:40.500> there<00:05:41.280> you

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
have it a bunch of jump rings so if you

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.690 
have it a bunch of jump rings so if you
needed<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.500> make<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.710> bracelet<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.400> have<00:05:44.670> a

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
needed to make a bracelet you have a

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.150 
needed to make a bracelet you have a
bunch<00:05:44.940> of<00:05:45.060> um<00:05:45.150> now<00:05:45.870> there<00:05:46.020> is<00:05:46.170> a<00:05:46.200> downside<00:05:46.710> to

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
bunch of um now there is a downside to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.040 
bunch of um now there is a downside to
this<00:05:47.310> first<00:05:47.640> of<00:05:47.790> all<00:05:47.850> does<00:05:48.300> cost<00:05:48.540> money<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:48.960> buy

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
this first of all does cost money to buy

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.960 
this first of all does cost money to buy
this<00:05:49.110> little<00:05:49.500> tool<00:05:49.680> but<00:05:50.100> if<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.370> are<00:05:50.520> doing<00:05:50.790> a

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
this little tool but if you are doing a

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.510 
this little tool but if you are doing a
lot<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.180> like<00:05:51.420> eating<00:05:51.870> of<00:05:51.960> bracelets<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:53.310> comes

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
lot of like eating of bracelets it comes

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.360 
lot of like eating of bracelets it comes
in<00:05:53.700> really<00:05:53.850> handy<00:05:54.650> but<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.800> other<00:05:55.920> thing<00:05:56.190> is

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
in really handy but the other thing is

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.400 
in really handy but the other thing is
sometimes<00:05:56.850> when<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.120> cuts<00:05:57.360> they<00:05:58.170> make<00:05:58.380> a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
sometimes when it cuts they make a

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.620 
sometimes when it cuts they make a
little<00:05:58.650> funny<00:05:58.980> edge<00:05:59.340> I'm<00:06:00.030> probably<00:06:00.390> get<00:06:00.600> a

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
little funny edge I'm probably get a

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.210 
little funny edge I'm probably get a
close-up<00:06:01.050> shot<00:06:01.080> on<00:06:01.440> this<00:06:01.590> after<00:06:01.980> we're<00:06:02.100> done

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
close-up shot on this after we're done

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.040 
close-up shot on this after we're done
or<00:06:02.460> maybe<00:06:02.670> we'll<00:06:02.880> slice<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.360> in<00:06:03.480> there<00:06:03.660> but<00:06:03.840> I

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
or maybe we'll slice it in there but I

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.750 
or maybe we'll slice it in there but I
don't<00:06:04.620> know<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:04.980> you<00:06:05.070> can<00:06:05.190> see<00:06:05.490> it

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.340 

underneath<00:06:08.760> and<00:06:09.150> jump<00:06:09.330> ring<00:06:09.540> is<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.780> tiny

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.600 
underneath and jump ring is a tiny
little<00:06:11.000> LeSabre<00:06:12.000> of<00:06:12.180> metal<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:13.470> okay<00:06:14.400> yeah

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
little LeSabre of metal that okay yeah

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
you can file it off there if you really

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.560 
you can file it off there if you really
want<00:06:16.230> to<00:06:16.470> but<00:06:17.340> if<00:06:17.610> you're<00:06:17.880> really<00:06:18.270> doing<00:06:18.510> a

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
project with a lot of jump rings this is

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.970 
project with a lot of jump rings this is
a<00:06:20.580> really<00:06:20.880> efficient<00:06:21.300> way<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.480> do<00:06:21.690> so
