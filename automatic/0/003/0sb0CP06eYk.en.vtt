00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
the largest cylindrical-shaped petal

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.130 
the largest cylindrical-shaped petal
which<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.080> course<00:02:47.110> now<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.920> buttoned<00:02:48.990> take<00:02:49.990> it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
which of course now is buttoned take it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.100 
which of course now is buttoned take it
out<00:02:50.230> very<00:02:50.320> careful<00:02:50.890> not<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.430> rip<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.810> we

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
out very careful not to rip it so we

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.410 
out very careful not to rip it so we
have<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.440> top<00:02:53.710> quite<00:02:54.220> thin<00:02:54.580> edge<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.240> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
have the top quite thin edge and the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.710 
have the top quite thin edge and the
bottom<00:02:55.720> edge<00:02:55.870> which<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> little<00:02:56.410> thicker<00:02:57.720> so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
bottom edge which is a little thicker so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
bottom edge which is a little thicker so
laying<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> flat<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.770> mat<00:03:00.120> we're<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.210> to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
laying it flat on the mat we're going to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.380 
laying it flat on the mat we're going to
start<00:03:01.600> off<00:03:01.840> by<00:03:02.110> doing<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.770> just<00:03:03.270> folding<00:03:04.270> over

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
start off by doing is just folding over

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.240 
start off by doing is just folding over
the<00:03:04.600> top<00:03:04.930> right-hand<00:03:05.230> corner<00:03:06.990> as<00:03:07.990> if<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.130> were

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the top right-hand corner as if you were

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.220 
the top right-hand corner as if you were
marking<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.610> page<00:03:09.910> in<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.209> book<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:11.080> know

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
marking the page in a book you know

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.080 
marking the page in a book you know
you're<00:03:11.350> not<00:03:11.410> supposed<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.860> do<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.340> then<00:03:12.910> we're

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
you're not supposed to do and then we're

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.510 
you're not supposed to do and then we're
going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.270> roll<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.720> bottom<00:03:14.130> across<00:03:15.130> from

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
going to roll the bottom across from

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.949 
going to roll the bottom across from
right<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.120> left<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.790> form<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.239> into<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.600> sort<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
right to left to form it into a sort of

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.390 
right to left to form it into a sort of
a<00:03:20.080> cylindrical<00:03:20.590> shape<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.190> okay<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
a cylindrical shape like that okay and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.330 
a cylindrical shape like that okay and
this<00:03:24.790> wider<00:03:25.150> edge<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> cylinder<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
this wider edge of the cylinder is the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.780 
this wider edge of the cylinder is the
base<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.420> rose<00:03:29.350> board<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.040> if<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.670> look

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
base of the rose board and if you look

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.520 
base of the rose board and if you look
at<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.000> top<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.480> can<00:03:31.660> see<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.260> does

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
at the top you can see that that does

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.130 
at the top you can see that that does
look<00:03:32.830> like<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.310> center<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.820> rose<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.480> then

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
look like the center of a rose and then

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.750 
look like the center of a rose and then
just<00:03:35.440> stand<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.220> sort<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.520> press

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
just stand that and just sort of press

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.020 
just stand that and just sort of press
it<00:03:36.940> down<00:03:36.970> onto<00:03:37.540> your<00:03:38.080> mat<00:03:38.110> or<00:03:38.440> plate<00:03:38.800> so<00:03:39.489> they

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
it down onto your mat or plate so they

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.180 
it down onto your mat or plate so they
stay<00:03:40.270> still<00:03:40.660> while<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.050> start<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.770> attach<00:03:42.160> the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
stay still while you start to attach the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.530 
stay still while you start to attach the
other<00:03:42.370> petals<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:44.620> then<00:03:44.799> take<00:03:45.150> each<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
other petals we then take each of the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.280 
other petals we then take each of the
petals<00:03:47.049> in<00:03:47.830> turn<00:03:48.220> out<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.940> bag<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:50.110> we

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
petals in turn out of the bag and we

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.390 
petals in turn out of the bag and we
arrange<00:03:50.620> them<00:03:50.890> around<00:03:51.160> our<00:03:51.580> central<00:03:52.299> good

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
arrange them around our central good

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.430 
arrange them around our central good
with<00:03:54.400> obviously<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.540> thinner<00:03:55.780> part<00:03:56.110> at<00:03:56.320> the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
with obviously the thinner part at the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.080 
with obviously the thinner part at the
top<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.160> can<00:03:57.340> fill<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.730> little<00:03:57.820> bit

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
top and you can fill in a little bit

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.789 
top and you can fill in a little bit
more<00:03:58.299> at<00:03:58.450> this<00:03:58.600> stage<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.350> you<00:03:59.890> like<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.799> we

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
more at this stage if you like and we

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.140 
more at this stage if you like and we
just<00:04:03.010> attach<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:04.140> at<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.260> base<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.950> just<00:04:06.880> let

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
just attach it at the base and just let

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.280 
just attach it at the base and just let
it<00:04:07.680> curl<00:04:08.680> naturally<00:04:08.950> back<00:04:09.780> away<00:04:10.780> from<00:04:11.170> the

it curl naturally back away from the
center<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:12.010> rose<00:04:13.709> we<00:04:14.709> take<00:04:14.950> each<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.459> them

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
center of the rose we take each of them

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.659 
center of the rose we take each of them
in<00:04:15.730> turn<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.720> attach<00:04:17.260> them<00:04:19.919> just<00:04:20.919> overlap<00:04:21.430> in

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
in turn and attach them just overlap in

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:28.080 
in turn and attach them just overlap in
the<00:04:21.790> previous<00:04:22.180> one

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.180 

as<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.240> attach<00:04:29.629> the<00:04:29.660> petals<00:04:30.229> if<00:04:30.349> if<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.620> fonda

to take off this excess bonus on turning
the<00:05:04.909> rose<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.479> just<00:05:06.319> nip<00:05:06.560> in<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.770> fondant

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
the rose and just nip in the fondant

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.390 
the rose and just nip in the fondant
until<00:05:09.770> it<00:05:09.889> finally<00:05:10.190> just<00:05:10.669> breaks<00:05:11.210> off<00:05:12.400> and

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
until it finally just breaks off and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.999 
until it finally just breaks off and
then<00:05:13.759> we<00:05:13.880> can<00:05:14.060> just<00:05:14.259> pull<00:05:15.259> the<00:05:15.380> petals<00:05:15.590> out<00:05:15.949> a

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
then we can just pull the petals out a

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.680 
then we can just pull the petals out a
little<00:05:16.220> bit<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.810> there<00:05:18.409> we<00:05:18.530> have<00:05:18.560> our<00:05:18.710> rose<00:05:19.690> so

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
little bit and there we have our rose so

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.620 
little bit and there we have our rose so
while<00:05:21.169> it's<00:05:21.349> drying<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:22.039> prefer<00:05:22.819> to<00:05:23.210> have<00:05:23.389> it<00:05:23.419> on

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
while it's drying I prefer to have it on

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.700 
while it's drying I prefer to have it on
a<00:05:23.659> plate<00:05:24.490> covered<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:25.699> cling<00:05:26.000> film<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.199> it

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
a plate covered in cling film so that it

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.279 
a plate covered in cling film so that it
doesn't<00:05:27.889> stick<00:05:28.039> and<00:05:28.639> just<00:05:29.150> allowing<00:05:29.599> one<00:05:30.169> of

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
doesn't stick and just allowing one of

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.939 
doesn't stick and just allowing one of
the<00:05:30.349> petals<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.949> curl<00:05:32.169> over<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:33.530> edge<00:05:33.620> of<00:05:33.800> the

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
the petals to curl over the edge of the

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.740 
the petals to curl over the edge of the
plate<00:05:34.190> like<00:05:34.460> that<00:05:34.699> until<00:05:34.940> until<00:05:35.300> they're<00:05:35.509> dry

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
plate like that until until they're dry

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.219 
plate like that until until they're dry
and<00:05:36.139> they<00:05:36.560> have<00:05:36.860> your<00:05:37.039> own
