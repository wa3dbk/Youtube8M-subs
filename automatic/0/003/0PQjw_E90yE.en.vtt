kill the anaconda you federal fighters

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.790 
kill the anaconda you federal fighters
you<00:00:49.650> don't<00:00:49.949> actually<00:00:50.220> have<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.910> kill<00:00:51.559> now<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you don't actually have to kill now that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.329 
you don't actually have to kill now that
is<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.989> important<00:00:54.989> points<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.680> many

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
is one of the important points that many

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.750 
is one of the important points that many
players<00:00:57.000> who<00:00:57.330> start<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.100> scenarios<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.610> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
players who start these scenarios at the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.540 
players who start these scenarios at the
problem<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.920> completing<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.370> mission

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
problem with completing this mission

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
problem with completing this mission
because<00:01:03.000> trying<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.140> kill<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> federal

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because trying to kill the federal

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.139 
because trying to kill the federal
fighters<00:01:05.399> first<00:01:06.200> will<00:01:07.200> cause<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.369> anaconda

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
fighters first will cause the anaconda

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.240 
fighters first will cause the anaconda
to<00:01:09.420> start<00:01:09.690> firing<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.039> are

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to start firing on you as you are

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.690 
to start firing on you as you are
killing<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.789> federal<00:01:12.240> fighters<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:14.460> will

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
killing the federal fighters that will

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.109 
killing the federal fighters that will
likely<00:01:15.149> cause<00:01:15.539> you<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> die<00:01:16.190> so<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.490> best

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
likely cause you to die so the best

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.180 
likely cause you to die so the best
strategy<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.050> that<00:01:19.289> I<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.590> found<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
strategy for this that I have found is

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.999 
strategy for this that I have found is
just<00:01:21.180> kill<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> big<00:01:21.810> score<00:01:22.110> anaconda<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
just kill the big score anaconda in

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.810 
just kill the big score anaconda in
front<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.020> beam<00:01:25.680> lasers<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
front of you so we have beam lasers and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.260 
front of you so we have beam lasers and
missile<00:01:27.479> ryx<00:01:27.690> as<00:01:27.990> our<00:01:28.229> weapons

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
missile ryx as our weapons

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.809 
missile ryx as our weapons
the<00:01:30.270> missiles<00:01:30.660> do<00:01:31.200> much<00:01:31.530> less<00:01:31.789> much<00:01:32.789> less

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
the missiles do much less much less

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.440 
the missiles do much less much less
damage<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.020> shields<00:01:34.259> than<00:01:35.039> lasers<00:01:35.550> do<00:01:35.789> we're

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
damage to shields than lasers do we're

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.080 
damage to shields than lasers do we're
going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> save<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.440> until<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:38.819> are<00:01:38.940> down

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
going to save them until the we are down

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.520 
going to save them until the we are down
into<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> hole<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.020> shields<00:01:40.289> are<00:01:40.380> done

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
into the hole and the shields are done

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
into the hole and the shields are done
so<00:01:41.190> I'm<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> fly<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.450> behind<00:01:43.050> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so I'm going to fly up behind the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.040 
so I'm going to fly up behind the
anaconda<00:01:44.099> here<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.970> full<00:01:45.390> hips<00:01:45.750> into

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
anaconda here with full hips into

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.779 
anaconda here with full hips into
weapons<00:01:46.349> two<00:01:46.740> pips<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> engine<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
weapons two pips in the engine so I

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.190 
weapons two pips in the engine so I
could<00:01:48.000> stay<00:01:48.179> behind<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.599> when<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.990> there

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
could stay behind it when I get there

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.589 
could stay behind it when I get there
I'm<00:01:49.709> going<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.220> beam<00:01:50.610> laser<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.300> take

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
I'm going to use my beam laser to take

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:52.160 
I'm going to use my beam laser to take
out<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
out the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590 
out the
kondeh<00:01:52.530> shields<00:01:53.030> they<00:01:54.030> will<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.330> engage

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
kondeh shields they will not engage

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.100 
kondeh shields they will not engage
until<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:56.009> engage<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.549> first<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.840> gives

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
until we engage them first so this gives

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
until we engage them first so this gives
us<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> perfect<00:01:58.530> opportunity<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.400> get<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
us the perfect opportunity to get to a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.179 
us the perfect opportunity to get to a
great<00:02:00.180> position<00:02:00.360> where<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> cannot<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:02.009> fired

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
great position where I cannot be fired

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.940 
great position where I cannot be fired
upon<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.390> Anaconda<00:02:03.960> does<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.530> turret

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
upon the Anaconda does have turret

can shoot me when I am behind it a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.760 
can shoot me when I am behind it a
little<00:02:09.000> low<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.840> stay<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.470> little

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
little low so if you stay up a little

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.820 
little low so if you stay up a little
higher<00:02:11.390> I'm<00:02:12.390> pushing<00:02:13.050> up<00:02:13.170> vertically<00:02:13.650> here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
higher I'm pushing up vertically here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.880 
higher I'm pushing up vertically here
and<00:02:14.520> then<00:02:14.640> start<00:02:14.910> attacking<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.680> will<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.770> able

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and then start attacking I will be able

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
and then start attacking I will be able
to<00:02:16.980> avoid<00:02:17.190> those<00:02:17.430> turret<00:02:17.850> lasers<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:20.640> going

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to avoid those turret lasers I'm going

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.280 
to avoid those turret lasers I'm going
to<00:02:21.000> try<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.209> keep<00:02:21.450> rotating<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
to try to keep rotating with the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.130 
to try to keep rotating with the
Anaconda<00:02:22.800> as<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.190> shooting<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.140> keeping

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
Anaconda as I'm shooting it and keeping

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.470 
Anaconda as I'm shooting it and keeping
myself<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.010> proper<00:02:26.459> position<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.060> avoid
