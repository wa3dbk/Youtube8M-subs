00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.370
Hello everyone
World Rubber Market

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.600
Yassun.
Today's Table Tennis Chiebukuro is

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.960
Counter in the back table software
The loop drive of opponent

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.270
Doing counter for
I think it is going

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.170
Speed ​​drive in question
Against loop drive

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.460
Please tell me the counter
This time in the fact that the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.109
To loop drive
And would like to do in the form of

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.510
I think you
That first back table software

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.210
Senkei a But the
In fact the loop drive to the other party

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.110
When it is high probability Senkei to be
You say

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.110
The table that software
In early RBI as possible in front of team

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.180
Recognizing and go play
Often I but its rhythm

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.320
from early deployment order to break
In order to break the slow rhythm

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.489
Slowly loop drive
In Far Innovation high ball

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.699
I come break the rhythm
Is very large for that opponent

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.609
By that disturb the rhythm
Is that the hitting point and pitch

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:09.240
Mistakes made in discord hand
It is because more easily

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.490
So speaking in reverse
That the called loop drive

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.849
I hit firmly at the counter
The big to the other party as long as things

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.799
Be given the pressure
Can you

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.469
Table soft break the loop drive
I will not use the of that

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.009
It is because
So this loop drive

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.469
The counter to
Is firmly of that

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.329
I want crowded spear technique
It will be to come until the end

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.380
I think that the Na want to hear the story
The first thing that loop drive

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.969
And shallow loop drive
To refer a deep loop drive

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.020
Divided
This term is so high sphere

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.529
Where to when it exceeds the net
That the whether that fall

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:50.929
It is for easy to adjust
That's speed drive

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.709
Before and after to be bound
When say it either than the position

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.369
was toward go speed
Better things to be aware of that

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.539
Strong I but
With respect to loop drive

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.959
To enter deeply into shallow around
Because they are adjusted for that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.319
And identify and shallow deep First
I will start from the place

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.030
First in shallow loop drive
Counters for

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.010
And I'm going to explain
First shallow loop drive

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.370
I catch the ball against
Is point

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.340
Place to capture the ball ball
Since shallow that's just a drop

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.379
When I close to the net
When taken in too low RBI

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.840
By frequent net mistakes
It away you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.750
By bound because it is
Firmly the height of the net

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.900
Little increase in per it exceeds
I hit at the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.810
Packed to the course too high
It is easy my beat so put away

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.159
Important that you keep in position
such is but a dare to

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.430
At the place where it exceeds the height of the net
In to hit the pow

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.480
Please try to
The second point of

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.829
As much as possible the impact
We strongly

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.939
To say the loop drive
Since the rotation is hanging

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.689
If the impact is weak
And lost the amount of rotation

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.090
And thereby over the ball
it is many ringing that put away

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.090
It away you
In rotation say me either

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.010
In his power to avoid losing
I would elaborate suppressed and Pan~tsu

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.379
The opponent's court in feeling like
Such as Komu shoot in a straight line

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.290
Please hit in the image
Relatively that's shallow loop drive

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.670
Since the net pro
From top to bottom in the opponent's court

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.480
In a straight line so easy slammed
Such as Komu hit me pawn

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.349
Please play with feeling
In contrast to this is a loop drive

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.049
Of
Of counter

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.060
You will point
Here over miss

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.810
Who's that large
In Tatakikome well to the opponent's court

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.499
Because it does not have the image speaking
With the intention aimed at more shallow place

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:51.579
Please doing banging to strengthen slightly
The next deep loop drive

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.230
Counters for
The described I think we want and to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.159
In deep loop drive
As much as possible and against

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.430
Such as capture the immediately following bound
Please try it with the image

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.620
We back table is only
Since it is often you are in the vicinity of the platform

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.409
The RBI against deep ball
When would delay

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.090
And gone and only hit while falling
It away you

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.120
Sonaruto it got jammed
To say the well counter

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.819
In deep loop so can not
Early and RBI against

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.080
Ensure that taken in a low place
To say after table software

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.169
To linear sphere prone rubber
Will you

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.840
Strong even above rotation say
I because not applied

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.460
So when it is caught at an early RBI
In too strong force

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.590
If you try to control
The linear ball net

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.139
Easy to pierce
In such a way that

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.210
Ringing gone
Miss you frequent

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.930
So deep loop drive
When you counter is

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.180
Either and say and 78% of position
To counter in the power of

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.580
Please try to consciousness
If anything

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.449
Such as aim deeply into the opponent's court
Image

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.020
Since the distance to the net long
Slowly beyond the net

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.150
As fall deeply into the opponent's court
In 78% of the power in the image

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.060
Please hitting
Is absolutely loop drive

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.190
Of a deep and 100% of the power
Since the counter is difficult

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.990
If anything
Courses up and depth-oriented

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.900
To counter the image
Please look in

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.539
Here still important thing
How shallow loop drive

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.449
Where to bound
I I called

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.629
Able to determine whether shallow or deep
I will be very important

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.530
To aim in one shot when shallow
When deep to go you can

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.800
To tell me either
Rather than to be decided by the one is

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.180
And of waiting for the next ball next sphere
Since takes the form

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.569
I firmly this proper use
You have become important is that

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.460
As a practice the various spheres
While asked mix

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.099
When you as cultivate the judgment
Counter of technology plus

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.199
And get to learn is that judgment
Because you think

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.199
In all means such way
Please try to practice

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.870
Actually shallow loop drive in
Deep loop drive against

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.490
Each with respect to the counter
And I'm going to do
