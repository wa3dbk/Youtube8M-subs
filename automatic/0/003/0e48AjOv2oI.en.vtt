for the 800 i this is the one for the
ports<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> top<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.809> for

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
ports on the top and this is just for

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.770 
ports on the top and this is just for
other<00:00:53.730> things<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.870> top<00:00:55.050> also<00:00:56.510> what<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> did

was I unplug these two right here and
left<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.120> H<00:01:03.300> 400<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.930> plugged<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.379> by<00:01:04.530> itself<00:01:05.420> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
left the H 400 I plugged in by itself of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
left the H 400 I plugged in by itself of
course<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.049> power<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.830> did<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
course the power was off when I did this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640 
course the power was off when I did this
so<00:01:08.970> I'll<00:01:09.060> turn<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> power<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:10.470> sure

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so I'll turn off the power make sure

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.490 
so I'll turn off the power make sure
it's<00:01:10.799> unplugged<00:01:11.010> pushed<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.500> power

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it's unplugged pushed little power

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
motherboard while it's unplugged and

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.890 
motherboard while it's unplugged and
it's<00:01:20.369> called<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> cold<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it's called a cold start and then you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's called a cold start and then you
plug<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> back<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.540> turn<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:27.080> what

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
plug it back in and then turn it on what

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760 
plug it back in and then turn it on what
should<00:01:28.350> happen<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:30.229> with<00:01:31.229> these<00:01:31.530> two

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
should happen is with these two

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.270 
should happen is with these two
unplugged<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.700> computer<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.509> these<00:01:33.720> two

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
unplugged in the computer with these two

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.440 
unplugged in the computer with these two
unplugged<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> computer<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.180> now

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
unplugged and the computer not off now

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.830 
unplugged and the computer not off now
back<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.829> age<00:01:37.979> 100<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.670> should<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.810> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
back on the age 100 I should not be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.010 
back on the age 100 I should not be
fighting<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.350> any<00:01:40.710> resources<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:42.020> competing

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
fighting for any resources or competing

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.490 
fighting for any resources or competing
for<00:01:43.229> resources<00:01:43.520> with<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
for resources with the other two so it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
for resources with the other two so it
should<00:01:46.740> start<00:01:47.009> working<00:01:47.189> again<00:01:47.460> minded<00:01:48.229> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
should start working again minded it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
should start working again minded it
wasn't<00:01:49.560> showing<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.390> now<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> did<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> little

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
wasn't showing at all now I did a little

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.620 
wasn't showing at all now I did a little
bit<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> trial<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.380> error<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.700> came<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
bit of trial and error and I came to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.499 
bit of trial and error and I came to
find<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.219> my<00:01:56.219> mouse<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:57.000> plugged<00:01:57.360> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
find out that my mouse is plugged in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.399 
find out that my mouse is plugged in
over<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> USB<00:01:59.479> 3.0<00:02:01.310> but<00:02:02.310> before<00:02:03.409> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
over here to a USB 3.0 but before the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.040 
over here to a USB 3.0 but before the
mouse<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.829> plugged<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:08.869> one<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.929> these

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
mouse is plugged in to one of these

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.530 
mouse is plugged in to one of these
slots<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:11.120> turns<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
slots right here turns out that the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.900 
slots right here turns out that the
mouse<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:13.440> competing<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:13.950> resources<00:02:14.190> with

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
mouse was competing for resources with

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.699 
mouse was competing for resources with
h100<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.550> for<00:02:17.670> some<00:02:17.910> reason<00:02:18.440> when<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.500> plug

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
h100 I but for some reason when I plug

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.770 
h100 I but for some reason when I plug
in<00:02:19.860> my<00:02:19.890> external<00:02:20.340> hard<00:02:20.580> drive<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:24.030> H<00:02:24.300> 100<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
in my external hard drive it the H 100 I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.890 
in my external hard drive it the H 100 I
keeps<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.440> working<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.480> turns<00:02:27.629> out<00:02:27.750> was

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
keeps on working so it turns out was

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
keeps on working so it turns out was
just<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.230> mouse<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.830> age<00:02:28.920> 100<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
just the mouse the age 100 I and the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.300 
just the mouse the age 100 I and the
mouse<00:02:30.060> somehow<00:02:30.650> don't<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.800> each<00:02:31.950> other<00:02:32.099> they

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
mouse somehow don't like each other they

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.970 
mouse somehow don't like each other they
were<00:02:32.400> competing<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:32.819> resources<00:02:33.980> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
were competing for resources the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
were competing for resources the
external<00:02:35.280> hard<00:02:35.370> drive<00:02:35.580> does<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:36.000> seem<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
external hard drive does not seem to

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.960 
external hard drive does not seem to
compete<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.379> resources<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:38.010> H<00:02:38.160> 100<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.870> so

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
compete for resources with H 100 I so
