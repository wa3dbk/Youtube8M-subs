I've actually said this before I had
predicted<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.969> think<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.690> would

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
predicted I think actually they would

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
hit don't let it someone like right back

is<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> Undertaker<00:00:57.090> Street<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:57.989> be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is the Undertaker Street which would be

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.970 
is the Undertaker Street which would be
stupid<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.600> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> though<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.770> they

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
stupid but this is just though if they

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.219 
stupid but this is just though if they
even<00:01:02.340> thought<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.300> possibility<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
even thought of the possibility of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.660

WrestleMania<00:02:05.060> matches<00:02:05.270> even<00:02:05.570> though<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.750> think

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
WrestleMania matches even though I think

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.270 
WrestleMania matches even though I think
he<00:02:05.990> should<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.289> ahead<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.560> retire<00:02:06.799> anyways

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
he should go ahead and retire anyways

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.570 
he should go ahead and retire anyways
but<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.509> you're<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.289> WrestleMania<00:02:09.619> match<00:02:10.009> you

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
but if you're the WrestleMania match you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.890 
but if you're the WrestleMania match you
know<00:02:10.700> that's<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.000> big<00:02:11.239> batch<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
know that's a big batch it's not a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.180 
know that's a big batch it's not a
global<00:02:12.260> batch<00:02:12.410> they<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.040> there

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
global batch they have to be in there

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.410

for<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.370> little<00:02:13.519> time<00:02:13.849> they<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.269> do

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
for a little time they have to do

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.640 
for a little time they have to do
extreme<00:02:15.260> stuff<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.420> chances<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.080> Ryback

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
extreme stuff so the chances of Ryback

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.500 
extreme stuff so the chances of Ryback
injuried<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> Undertaker<00:02:19.849> are<00:02:20.030> very<00:02:20.269> high

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
injuried the Undertaker are very high

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.059 
injuried the Undertaker are very high
just<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.140> took<00:02:21.260> watching<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.890> much

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
just because it took watching so much

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.790 
just because it took watching so much
stuff<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:23.209> like<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.930> said<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.290> don't<00:02:24.560> feel

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
stuff but like I said I just don't feel

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.550 
stuff but like I said I just don't feel
that<00:02:25.370> he<00:02:25.550> deserves<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.410> ring<00:02:27.500> with

that he deserves to be in the ring with

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.949 
that he deserves to be in the ring with
the<00:02:27.769> Undertaker<00:02:27.920> at<00:02:28.280> WrestleMania<00:02:28.480> period<00:02:29.480> he

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
the Undertaker at WrestleMania period he

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.990

hit the street at least a legend anyways

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.330 
hit the street at least a legend anyways
and<00:02:44.750> in<00:02:45.140> my<00:02:45.349> opinion<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.890> think<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.160> Undertaker

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
and in my opinion I think the Undertaker

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.699 
and in my opinion I think the Undertaker
should<00:02:46.670> just<00:02:46.849> retired<00:02:47.209> without<00:02:47.569> losing<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
should just retired without losing and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.680 
should just retired without losing and
you<00:02:49.130> know<00:02:49.310> no<00:02:49.819> one<00:02:49.940> ever<00:02:50.090> thought<00:02:50.299> will<00:02:50.540> ever

this<00:02:55.010> greedy<00:02:55.400> guy<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.380> he's<00:02:57.380> not<00:02:57.590> gonna<00:02:57.709> let

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
this greedy guy and he's not gonna let

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.229 
this greedy guy and he's not gonna let
Undertaker<00:02:58.280> leave<00:02:58.519> without<00:02:58.760> taking

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
Undertaker leave without taking

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.910 
Undertaker leave without taking
something<00:02:59.450> from<00:02:59.750> him<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.290> he's<00:03:00.590> gonna<00:03:00.739> make

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
something from him so he's gonna make

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.460 
something from him so he's gonna make
them<00:03:01.070> lose<00:03:01.390> if<00:03:02.390> there<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:02.989> person<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.350> I

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
them lose if there is one person that I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.590 
them lose if there is one person that I
think<00:03:03.739> should<00:03:03.920> be<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.400> Undertaker<00:03:05.060> if<00:03:05.390> my

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
think should be the Undertaker if my

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.870 
think should be the Undertaker if my
buddy<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.170> would<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.440> Cade<00:03:06.739> just<00:03:07.370> for<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:07.670> fact

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
buddy it would be Cade just for the fact

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.670 
buddy it would be Cade just for the fact
that<00:03:08.060> they're<00:03:08.390> supposedly<00:03:08.870> brothers<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
that they're supposedly brothers of the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.979 
that they're supposedly brothers of the
WWE<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.760> why<00:03:10.940> not<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.209> his<00:03:11.390> brother<00:03:11.540> beat<00:03:11.810> him

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
WWE so why not have his brother beat him

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.199
