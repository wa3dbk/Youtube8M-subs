is demonstrating one of the fun things
that<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.780> using<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> new<00:00:46.500> execute

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

that you can do using the new execute
detect<00:00:47.280> command<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.809> done<00:00:48.960> here

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
detect command so what we have done here

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
detect command so what we have done here
is<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.739> set<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.160> six<00:00:50.460> miniature

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is we have set up six miniature

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
is we have set up six miniature
environments<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> each<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> these

environments and each of these

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
environments and each of these
environments<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.110> specific<00:00:55.110> mob<00:00:55.289> type

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
environments has a specific mob type

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
environments has a specific mob type
that<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> allowed<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> exist<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that is allowed to exist in it if that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
that is allowed to exist in it if that
mob<00:00:58.260> wanders<00:00:59.190> over<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> border<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.059> the

mob wanders over the border into the

mob wanders over the border into the
next<00:01:00.480> environment<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.500> will<00:01:01.620> automatically

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
next environment it will automatically

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
next environment it will automatically
morph<00:01:02.399> into<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> correct<00:01:03.329> mob<00:01:03.600> type<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
morph into the correct mob type for that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.620 
morph into the correct mob type for that
environment

the zombie pigman natural habitat is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.800 
the zombie pigman natural habitat is
another<00:01:10.369> egg<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.119> when<00:01:11.210> he<00:01:11.270> crosses<00:01:11.479> into

skeleton and then in water of course he

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:37.899 
skeleton and then in water of course he
is<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.170> guardian<00:01:35.860> all<00:01:36.860> right<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:37.430> over<00:01:37.520> here<00:01:37.789> is

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
is a guardian all right so over here is

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.279 
is a guardian all right so over here is
where<00:01:38.119> it's<00:01:38.210> run<00:01:38.390> from<00:01:38.630> we've<00:01:38.840> got<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> clock

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
where it's run from we've got a clock

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.870 
where it's run from we've got a clock
running<00:01:39.679> here<00:01:39.860> with<00:01:40.009> our<00:01:40.159> command<00:01:40.460> blocks<00:01:40.670> on

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
running here with our command blocks on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880 
running here with our command blocks on
it<00:01:41.000> we've<00:01:41.240> got<00:01:41.539> 2<00:01:41.899> command<00:01:42.319> blocks<00:01:42.530> 1<00:01:42.740> either

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
it we've got 2 command blocks 1 either

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.649 
it we've got 2 command blocks 1 either
side<00:01:43.190> for<00:01:43.520> each<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.880> our<00:01:44.000> little<00:01:44.300> miniature

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
side for each of our little miniature

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.990 
side for each of our little miniature
environments<00:01:45.350> we'll<00:01:46.009> start<00:01:46.340> off<00:01:46.490> we'll<00:01:46.850> use

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
environments we'll start off we'll use

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.510 
environments we'll start off we'll use
the<00:01:47.210> zombie<00:01:47.539> pigman<00:01:47.960> as<00:01:48.200> an<00:01:48.319> example<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:48.920> how

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the zombie pigman as an example of how

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.370 
the zombie pigman as an example of how
it<00:01:49.580> works<00:01:49.850> basically<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.720> execute<00:01:51.110> command

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
it works basically the execute command

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.230 
it works basically the execute command
is<00:01:51.530> looking<00:01:51.830> for<00:01:51.979> anything<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.610> not<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
is looking for anything that is not a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.199 
is looking for anything that is not a
zombie<00:01:53.659> pigman<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.289> has<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.310> minimum<00:01:55.640> mob

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
zombie pigman and has a minimum mob

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.809 
zombie pigman and has a minimum mob
score<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.750> 1<00:01:57.080> we<00:01:57.649> have<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.890> add<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:58.280> mob<00:01:58.520> score

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
score of 1 we have to add this mob score

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.029 
score of 1 we have to add this mob score
because<00:01:59.119> otherwise<00:01:59.420> us<00:02:00.049> as<00:02:00.319> players<00:02:00.590> would<00:02:00.920> be

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
because otherwise us as players would be

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.850 
because otherwise us as players would be
detected<00:02:01.490> as<00:02:01.640> not<00:02:01.880> being<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.240> zombie<00:02:02.539> pigman<00:02:02.869> so

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
detected as not being a zombie pigman so

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.050 
detected as not being a zombie pigman so
we've<00:02:04.039> got<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.190> clock<00:02:04.399> running<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.909> gives

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
we've got a clock running that gives

them off into the void and that gives

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.920 
them off into the void and that gives
the<00:02:48.739> illusion<00:02:48.829> of<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.700> mob<00:02:50.030> turning<00:02:50.780> into

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
its place and TPS the dodgy one out at
