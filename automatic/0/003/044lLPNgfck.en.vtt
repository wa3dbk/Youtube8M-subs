00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
you like so you can it's like three

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.060 
you like so you can it's like three
modes<00:01:45.049> we<00:01:46.049> don't<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.470> same<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
modes we don't have the same on the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
modes we don't have the same on the
galaxy<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.560> galaxy<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> no<00:01:50.729> three<00:01:51.350> Apple

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
galaxy and the galaxy it no three Apple

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
galaxy and the galaxy it no three Apple
is<00:01:52.439> probably<00:01:52.710> doing<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.130> together<00:01:53.280> feel<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is probably doing it together feel it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
is probably doing it together feel it
looks<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.630> smooth<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.259> see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
looks a little more smooth you can see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
looks a little more smooth you can see
here<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.950> don't<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.460> how<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.180> free

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
here I don't know how this like free

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.609 
here I don't know how this like free
