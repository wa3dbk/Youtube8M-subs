going to bounce back up so see there
it's<00:03:02.769> pretty<00:03:03.010> easy<00:03:03.159> so<00:03:03.909> when<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.120> learn<00:03:04.269> how

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
it's pretty easy so when you learn how

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.030 
it's pretty easy so when you learn how
to<00:03:04.450> dribble<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:05.140> you've<00:03:05.379> got<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.829> push

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
to dribble all you've got to do is push

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.860 
to dribble all you've got to do is push
the<00:03:06.220> ball<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.519> floor<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.030> every<00:03:07.599> time<00:03:07.720> it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
the ball to the floor and every time it

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.360 
the ball to the floor and every time it
touches<00:03:08.140> your<00:03:08.170> hand<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.890> give<00:03:09.069> it<00:03:09.099> a<00:03:09.220> little

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
touches your hand just give it a little

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.680 
touches your hand just give it a little
bit<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.640> pushback<00:03:09.940> just<00:03:10.329> for<00:03:10.420> what<00:03:10.510> kind<00:03:10.659> of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
bit of pushback just for what kind of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.920 
bit of pushback just for what kind of
like<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:10.989> okay<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:12.510> that's<00:03:13.510> dribbling

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
like this okay so that's dribbling

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.780 
like this okay so that's dribbling
here's<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.680> cool<00:03:14.859> thing<00:03:14.920> about<00:03:15.129> dribbling<00:03:15.489> as

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
here's the cool thing about dribbling as

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.210 
here's the cool thing about dribbling as
you<00:03:16.480> practice<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.739> little<00:03:18.099> bit

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
you practice and you get a little bit

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.190 
you practice and you get a little bit
better<00:03:18.400> at<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.910> you're<00:03:19.359> going<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.660> actually<00:03:19.870> be

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
better at it you're going to actually be

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.930 
better at it you're going to actually be
able<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.440> dribble<00:03:20.739> without<00:03:21.310> looking<00:03:21.700> at<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
able to dribble without looking at the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.089 
able to dribble without looking at the
ball<00:03:22.109> so<00:03:23.109> maybe<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:23.739> one<00:03:23.919> of<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.069> things

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
ball so maybe that's one of the things

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.360 
ball so maybe that's one of the things
you<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.579> work<00:03:24.760> on<00:03:25.000> early<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.019> season

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you can work on early on this season

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.250 
you can work on early on this season
dribbling<00:03:27.599> then<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:28.720> get<00:03:28.840> pretty<00:03:29.049> nicely

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
dribbling then you get pretty nicely

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.650 
dribbling then you get pretty nicely
look<00:03:29.560> up<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> ball<00:03:31.299> is<00:03:31.329> going<00:03:31.480> to

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
look up because the ball is going to

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.690 
look up because the ball is going to
come<00:03:31.810> right<00:03:31.930> back<00:03:32.139> up<00:03:32.319> into<00:03:32.500> your<00:03:32.590> hand<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.069> as

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
come right back up into your hand and as

come right back up into your hand and as
you<00:03:33.819> get<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.329> little<00:03:34.359> bit<00:03:34.780> better<00:03:34.989> you're

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
you get just a little bit better you're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.099 
you get just a little bit better you're
going<00:03:35.889> to<00:03:35.980> actually<00:03:36.129> be<00:03:36.489> able<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.700> run<00:03:37.120> while

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109
