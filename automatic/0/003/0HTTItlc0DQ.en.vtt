take the rich history off the back wall
we<00:00:33.610> raised<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.149> to<00:00:34.180> give<00:00:34.390> that<00:00:34.539> Brazilian<00:00:34.930> type

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
original rotisserie is good but by

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.750 
original rotisserie is good but by
raising<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.950> assembly<00:00:39.340> back<00:00:39.399> Chua<00:00:39.700> Li

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
raising the assembly back Chua Li

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.729 
raising the assembly back Chua Li
increased<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.360> surface<00:00:40.750> area<00:00:41.079> heat<00:00:41.320> that

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
increased the surface area heat that

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.290 
increased the surface area heat that
crosses<00:00:42.280> over<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.579> as<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> rotisserie

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
crosses over that as the rotisserie

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.030 
crosses over that as the rotisserie
spins<00:00:43.719> instead<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.380> being<00:00:44.530> on<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.680> back<00:00:44.860> and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
spins instead of being on the back and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.260 
spins instead of being on the back and
the<00:00:45.100> juices<00:00:45.430> are<00:00:45.550> dripping<00:00:45.579> off<00:00:45.970> on<00:00:46.150> the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
the juices are dripping off on the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.180 
the juices are dripping off on the
cutlets<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:47.110> got<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.440> up<00:00:47.590> there<00:00:47.770> there<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.100> we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
cutlets we got that up there there so we

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.700 
cutlets we got that up there there so we
got<00:00:48.310> more<00:00:48.579> heat<00:00:48.940> transfer<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.660> our<00:00:49.690> meat<00:00:49.989> as<00:00:50.140> it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
got more heat transfer to our meat as it

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.440 
got more heat transfer to our meat as it
turns<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.370> juice<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.850> staying<00:00:52.120> on<00:00:52.270> there

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
turns that juice is staying on there

25,000 BTUs unique thing that we do is

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.379 
25,000 BTUs unique thing that we do is
we<00:01:38.709> do<00:01:38.859> not<00:01:38.979> top<00:01:39.340> port<00:01:39.639> atop<00:01:39.909> port<00:01:40.179> it<00:01:40.240> has<00:01:40.359> a

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:40.389 
we do not top port atop port it has a

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:42.959 
we do not top port atop port it has a
tendency<00:01:40.959> on<00:01:41.109> the<00:01:41.200> area<00:01:41.859> right<00:01:41.979> here<00:01:42.039> to<00:01:42.729> get

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
tendency on the area right here to get

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.489 
tendency on the area right here to get
debris<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.599> so<00:01:43.719> we<00:01:43.810> keep<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.139> on<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.319> side

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
debris in it so we keep it on the side

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.989 
debris in it so we keep it on the side
so<00:01:44.679> we're<00:01:44.829> getting<00:01:45.009> two<00:01:45.219> kernels<00:01:45.429> of<00:01:45.729> flame

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
so we're getting two kernels of flame

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.269 
so we're getting two kernels of flame
for<00:01:46.599> every<00:01:46.899> square<00:01:47.529> inches<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.039> we<00:01:48.099> get<00:01:48.219> a

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
for every square inches so we get a

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.730 
for every square inches so we get a
great<00:01:48.639> heat<00:01:49.029> process<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.349> unique<00:01:50.560> thing

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
great heat process so the unique thing

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.499 
great heat process so the unique thing
about<00:01:50.770> our<00:01:51.159> drip<00:01:51.609> tray<00:01:51.729> system<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.179> we<00:01:52.299> talked

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
about our drip tray system is we talked

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.419 
about our drip tray system is we talked
about<00:01:52.779> is<00:01:52.959> also<00:01:53.349> at<00:01:53.529> separators<00:01:54.009> here<00:01:54.219> see

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
separators we have individual heat

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.699 
separators we have individual heat
chambers<00:02:01.389> you're<00:02:01.539> really<00:02:01.869> able<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.259> cook<00:02:02.469> a

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
chambers you're really able to cook a

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.010 
chambers you're really able to cook a
gourmet<00:02:03.340> meal<00:02:03.549> by<00:02:03.909> having<00:02:04.240> high<00:02:04.419> heat<00:02:04.689> low

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
gourmet meal by having high heat low

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.659 
gourmet meal by having high heat low
heat<00:02:05.289> and<00:02:05.469> keeping<00:02:05.889> those<00:02:05.979> chambers<00:02:06.279> them

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:06.669 
heat and keeping those chambers them

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:08.430 
heat and keeping those chambers them
also<00:02:07.209> makes<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.539> very<00:02:07.630> efficient<00:02:08.380> because

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
also makes it very efficient because

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.660 
also makes it very efficient because
you're<00:02:08.619> not<00:02:08.709> spreading<00:02:08.979> heat<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.489> other

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
you're not spreading heat to the other

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.040 
you're not spreading heat to the other
side<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.119> that's<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.360> really<00:02:10.630> efficient

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
side and that's a really efficient

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.750 
side and that's a really efficient
system<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.530> there<00:02:11.709> next<00:02:12.370> level<00:02:12.610> we're<00:02:12.730> going

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
system on there next level we're going

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.850 
system on there next level we're going
to<00:02:12.910> talk<00:02:13.060> about<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.569> radiant<00:02:13.900> system<00:02:14.290> this

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
to talk about is the radiant system this

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.339 
to talk about is the radiant system this
radiant<00:02:15.370> system<00:02:15.760> isn't<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.420> great<00:02:16.989> thing<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
radiant system isn't a great thing to

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.770 
radiant system isn't a great thing to
have<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.800> neat<00:02:18.250> thing<00:02:18.459> about<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.630> look

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
have a neat thing about it is you look

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.510 
have a neat thing about it is you look
at<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.050> that's<00:02:20.260> your<00:02:20.440> high<00:02:20.620> heat<00:02:20.920> ceramic

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
at that that's your high heat ceramic

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.920 
at that that's your high heat ceramic
that<00:02:22.030> high<00:02:22.180> heats<00:02:22.420> around<00:02:22.660> we're<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that high heats around we're going to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.690 
that high heats around we're going to
put<00:02:23.050> two<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.380> each<00:02:23.530> side<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:24.280> high<00:02:24.490> heat

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
put two on each side that high heat

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.650 
put two on each side that high heat
ceramic<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.270> designed

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
ceramic is designed

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
ceramic is designed
to<00:02:25.750> radiate<00:02:26.230> heat<00:02:26.560> designed<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.220> take<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.490> hot

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to radiate heat designed to take the hot

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.550 
to radiate heat designed to take the hot
air<00:02:27.850> from<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.180> burner<00:02:28.390> these<00:02:28.930> become<00:02:29.320> hot

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
air from the burner these become hot

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.200 
air from the burner these become hot
they<00:02:29.800> radiate<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.460> heat<00:02:30.490> out<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.120> they

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
they radiate the heat out and they

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.790 
they radiate the heat out and they
minimize<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.140> flare-ups<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.620> that's<00:02:32.740> a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
minimize the flare-ups and that's a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.500 
minimize the flare-ups and that's a
great<00:02:33.070> thing<00:02:33.130> about<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.060> other<00:02:34.180> thing<00:02:34.390> is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
great thing about it the other thing is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.910 
great thing about it the other thing is
you<00:02:34.600> always<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:34.990> crazy<00:02:35.230> uncle<00:02:35.440> Charlie

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
you always have that crazy uncle Charlie

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.230 
you always have that crazy uncle Charlie
that's<00:02:36.040> always<00:02:36.160> spreading<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.640> sauce<00:02:36.940> over

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
that's always spreading that sauce over

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880 
that's always spreading that sauce over
their<00:02:37.360> net<00:02:37.510> coat<00:02:37.690> shadows<00:02:38.110> those<00:02:38.470> high<00:02:38.650> heat

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
their net coat shadows those high heat

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.740 
their net coat shadows those high heat
ceramics<00:02:39.310> up<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.910> doesn't<00:02:40.240> work<00:02:40.330> as<00:02:40.570> well

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
ceramics up and it doesn't work as well

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.510 
ceramics up and it doesn't work as well
the<00:02:41.050> nice<00:02:41.230> thing<00:02:41.260> about<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.800> we<00:02:41.920> cut<00:02:42.160> ours<00:02:42.340> in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
the nice thing about is we cut ours in

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.400 
the nice thing about is we cut ours in
half<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.120> by<00:02:43.330> flipping<00:02:43.630> them<00:02:43.900> over<00:02:44.080> they're

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
half and by flipping them over they're

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.710 
half and by flipping them over they're
easy<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.890> clean<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.250> put<00:02:45.700> off<00:02:46.150> your<00:02:46.360> cooking

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
easy to clean you put off your cooking

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.660 
easy to clean you put off your cooking
on<00:02:46.840> them<00:02:46.990> which<00:02:47.650> you're<00:02:47.860> done<00:02:48.100> come<00:02:48.340> out<00:02:48.490> I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
on them which you're done come out I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.280 
on them which you're done come out I
recommend<00:02:48.910> at<00:02:49.270> least<00:02:49.300> once<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.840> month<00:02:49.870> flip

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
recommend at least once a month flip

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.440 
recommend at least once a month flip
them<00:02:50.470> over<00:02:50.590> turn<00:02:51.070> these<00:02:51.250> burners<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.790> high<00:02:51.820> you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
them over turn these burners on high you

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.430 
them over turn these burners on high you
know<00:02:52.540> these<00:02:52.690> units<00:02:52.960> are<00:02:53.020> getting<00:02:53.230> close<00:02:53.410> to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
know these units are getting close to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
know these units are getting close to
over<00:02:53.710> 800<00:02:53.920> degrees<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.000> that'll<00:02:55.480> turn

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
over 800 degrees and that'll turn

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.360 
over 800 degrees and that'll turn
everything<00:02:56.020> into<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.380> self<00:02:56.680> clean<00:02:56.950> mode<00:02:57.130> all

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
everything into a self clean mode all

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.610 
everything into a self clean mode all
that<00:02:57.730> gook<00:02:57.970> all<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.360> stuff<00:02:58.630> will<00:02:58.840> turn<00:02:59.380> into

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
that gook all that stuff will turn into
