and caking all that from the outside
looking<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:44.830> obviously<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:45.430> may<00:01:45.520> look<00:01:45.729> like

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
looking in obviously it may look like

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.410 
looking in obviously it may look like
that<00:01:46.119> but<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:47.500> grind<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.250> time<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.820> patience

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
that but the grind the time the patience

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.690 
that but the grind the time the patience
and<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.600> actual<00:01:49.990> development<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.460> takes

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
and the actual development that it takes

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.490 
and the actual development that it takes
to<00:01:51.820> become<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> model<00:01:52.570> or<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> successful<00:01:53.200> model

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
is actually pretty difficult in my

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.219 
is actually pretty difficult in my
opinion<00:01:56.520> modeling<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.640> not<00:01:57.820> easy<00:01:58.110> acting<00:01:59.110> is
