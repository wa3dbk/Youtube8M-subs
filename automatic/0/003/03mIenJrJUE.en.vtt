00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and good to everyone here, most of us are 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.319
 back in a new house the house number 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.240
 10 and possibly the best house there 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 made me in minecraft mainly 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.530
 because he has everything and good this house 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 It took a little while to bring it because it is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.550
 quite big is more than a house is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.029
 as a villa and I've done it with my 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.940
 brother so that's why maybe I've 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.820
 brought a little before 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.410
 because he has done with him so nothing 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.150
 I'm going to teach them everything that the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.620
 equal house the video lasts a lot but 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.690
 I'm going to teach you everything you have 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.160
 we started here where I would be 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.960
 this kind of bridge with all this 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.610
 well decorated with plaster bamboo and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.220
 we would enter this area that would be a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.930
 little more decorative and that here already the one 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.770
 want can skillfully put the skills 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.480
 that can be put with this kind of 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.410
 magical headlights I've put him as 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.870
 decoration here with the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.420
 leaves that are hanging and give 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.190
 lighting and nothing else would be this 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.620
 It is mainly decorative 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.420
 area around here we would have this statue 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.570
 that I have put it I think in some other 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.570
 house but the depc I think I put it and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.850
 as I say this house has a lot of all 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 the other houses that I have made would go up 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.080
 some down these stairs and what 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.080
 we would have around here it would be like a room 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.500
 to hang out here has enough 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.030
 decorative is quite useful 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.119
 also the house this would be like a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.920
 fish tank that from here could put the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.960
 calamari what happens is that when 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.690
 methods disappear so the one that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.570
 you can already put them so you can see 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.550
 as if it were a fishbowl for that reason 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.170
 this success here so you can enter 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.570
 In this area, I'm going to show you the latest 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.540
 which is the east bridge that you see there 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.940
 up we would continue here and the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.100
 right we would have a kind of exit 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 of entry or how you want to see it towards 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.230
 asia the way we have and it's nothing else 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.400
 that's just a bridge here for 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:03.370
 enter faster and easier and we would leave 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.970
 in this area and on the right we would have 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.260
 this how to say this farm with the most 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.630
 basic that cows would be chickens and pigs 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.970
 in this area I have put a lot also 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.060
 of these pillars that although you see a 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.800
 little modern style and the house be a 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.270
 little more rustic, I think you have left 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.570
 pretty good over here we'll have a 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.760
 source this entry that would be the super 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.350
 tree this we have done that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.640
 would also connect with the fort with the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.340
 bridge stopped in this the more benzine 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.500
 forward here we would have the site 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.930
 where we would keep donkeys to the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 horses in this area and this would be the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.810
 I dump it and I quite liked 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.240
 this did my brother is a mechanism 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.810
 that we will open here we would launch the 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.750
 objects that we would like to eliminate and 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 We closed when leaving this area and it was 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.700
 pretty well the truth and it's one of the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.800
 things that although it's quite simple I 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.600
 I like to see 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.750
 first what would be the house that is 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.970
 simply the site of ovens chests 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.240
 the anvils and tables of craft eo and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.010
 others and on the second floor that would be for 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.180
 this area we would have a 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.970
 with two double beds with buy here 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.379
 the sides and a pool that would be by 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.200
 this area what we wanted to do was 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.890
 as a kind of boat here but it's 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.980
 better but I decided to make a better 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.420
 house boat in the odd video of 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.329
 a house that will be in the future 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.590
 and this I have left it like this although it has more 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.330
 or less the shape of a boat 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.920
 I have decided to do it better in another 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.860
 another house so here on the right 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 we would have a 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.060
 like some crops 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.860
 pressing here I think this already what 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.480
 I did in other houses it would be collected and 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.910
 would put here I do not think it's necessary 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.740
 put chests because just like that 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.590
 by pressing here you can collect everything 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.270
 that what has been taken from this area and 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.450
 Well I'll take all this so that no 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.330
 look bad and nothing else would crop 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.670
 how to say the automatic tubes 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.500
 automatic would be the word with this 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.650
 right here with leaves and bordering and 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.540
 others and would also lead to this this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.010
 small bridge that we would have around here 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.989
 that would be in the main area of ​​the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.709
 home so I have not taught them 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.500
 all of the house and that I'm going to 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.530
 show them that bridge from this other 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.350
 area then we will go down the part of the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.090
 tree that I have not yet taught 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.460
 we would continue here but I will eliminate 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.230
 all this and the first thing we would have 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
 it would be one of the best areas that I 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.020
 I think I've stayed is pretty 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.360
 simple but it is one of the ones that has most 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.180
 liked it would be this to make your 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.950
 enchantments and that I think that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.470
 it looks pretty good it's pretty simple 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.669
 but I quite like it would be high 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.569
 from the hill here is going to teach a little 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.669
 so they can see how it 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.159
 we would continue on this bridge that as 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.319
 I said connect with the super tree area 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.809
 tree that we have made and the tree does not 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.339
 simply decoration but it has what 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:05.309
 of the potions and that around here 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:07.409
 we would have to put them and on this side 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.839
 we would have the chests to keep 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.969
 the positions and that now later 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.589
 I'm going to go down here but first I'm going to 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.209
 teach them this other area before they 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:19.110
 it is done at night because if it is not 

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:21.749
 record well would the portal be at the level that 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.529
 it would be good to be in the highest part 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:27.539
 from the site at the top of the mountain 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.669
 a little decoration around here so you 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.639
 see much better and much more more loaded 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.889
 much more crowded the area and nothing more good 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.919
 I'm going to show them the tree that is not 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.349
 either it is simply the descent or it is for 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.180
 also cut a little way to 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.860
 neither have to give a whole turn to 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.379
 the time to go up and that so that either 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.059
 be so heavy and it would simply be that 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.279
 a little more decoration lighting 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:53.099
 so that any not available 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.529
 of monster in here and nothing else 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.939
 would be house number 10 I think a 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.200
 of the best I've done but the 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.820
 better than I have done 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.040
 I hope you liked any 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.260
 idea you have for the next houses 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.580
 what am I going to be doing I would like that 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.830
 I put it in the comments I already have 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.990
 some ideas to do some other 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.940
 home but I hope you liked it 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.350
 this house as always the link of 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.360
 download to the description as the 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.420
 seed because if they want to build 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.400
 in this in this world and nothing else 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.780
 we see in a next house a greeting to 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.780
 all and goodbye
