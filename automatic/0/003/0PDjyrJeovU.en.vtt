00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.250 
it was it was difficult the gaff rod a
few<00:02:44.030> years<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.300> say<00:02:44.450> was<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.600> half-time<00:02:44.930> because

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
few years to say was a half-time because

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.559 
few years to say was a half-time because
for<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.190> last<00:02:46.280> 20<00:02:46.640> 25<00:02:47.030> minutes<00:02:47.300> for<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.450> first

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
for the last 20 25 minutes for the first

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.260 
for the last 20 25 minutes for the first
half<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.800> know<00:02:48.920> they<00:02:49.069> were<00:02:49.130> better<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.400> was<00:02:49.550> all

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
half you know they were better I was all

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.660 
half you know they were better I was all
over<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.540> field<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.830> know<00:02:51.920> he<00:02:52.340> had<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.489> few

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
over the field and you know he had a few

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.040 
over the field and you know he had a few
words<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:52.970> say<00:02:53.000> about<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.450> but<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.750> think<00:02:53.959> in

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
words to say about that but I think in

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.840 
words to say about that but I think in
the<00:02:54.110> second<00:02:54.440> half<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.709> was<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:55.700> know<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
the second half it was a you know a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.910 
the second half it was a you know a
different<00:02:56.720> game<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.230> think<00:02:57.410> we<00:02:57.470> dominated

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
different game and I think we dominated

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.220 
different game and I think we dominated
for<00:02:58.100> for<00:02:58.519> large<00:02:58.640> periods<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.300> when<00:02:59.959> we<00:03:00.080> got

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
for for large periods and when we got

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.500 
for for large periods and when we got
the<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.650> goal<00:03:00.830> we<00:03:01.040> we<00:03:01.430> start<00:03:01.670> bucking<00:03:01.970> am<00:03:02.330> i

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the the goal we we start bucking am i

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.850 
the the goal we we start bucking am i
used<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> keeping<00:03:02.870> her<00:03:03.019> back<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.530> mentioned
