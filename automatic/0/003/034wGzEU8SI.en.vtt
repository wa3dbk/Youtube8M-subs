00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.170 
option the web sealer is about $12 ah
and<00:04:21.020> it<00:04:21.560> used<00:04:21.799> bottled<00:04:22.340> us<00:04:22.460> about<00:04:22.729> four<00:04:23.090> to

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
and it used bottled us about four to

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.140 
and it used bottled us about four to
five<00:04:23.240> bundles<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.050> hair

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
five bundles of hair

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.490 
five bundles of hair
so<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:27.300> also<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.479> think<00:04:28.630> when<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.199> have

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
so and also I think when you have

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.080 
so and also I think when you have
already<00:04:29.620> have<00:04:29.860> like<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.040> wig<00:04:30.280> sewn<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:30.820> you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
already have like a wig sewn on and you

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.550 
already have like a wig sewn on and you
want<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.300> go<00:04:31.419> back<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:31.870> seal<00:04:32.139> it'll<00:04:32.500> be

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
want to go back in and seal it'll be

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.100 
want to go back in and seal it'll be
easier<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.250> do<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.000> sealing<00:04:34.389> itself<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.900> drip

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
easier to do the sealing itself the drip

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.030 
easier to do the sealing itself the drip
bottle<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:36.040> an<00:04:36.100> awesome<00:04:36.310> idea<00:04:36.550> um<00:04:37.919> but<00:04:38.919> yeah

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
bottle it's an awesome idea um but yeah

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
bottle it's an awesome idea um but yeah
I<00:04:39.070> think<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:40.530> personally<00:04:41.530> like<00:04:42.220> it<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.610> can't
