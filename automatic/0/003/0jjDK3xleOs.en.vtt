gonna put this towel here so it can seep
out<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.700> bit<00:01:01.910> neat<00:01:02.090> see<00:01:02.300> when<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.450> compress<00:01:02.720> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
out a bit neat see when I compress the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.279 
out a bit neat see when I compress the
piston<00:01:03.500> there's<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.460> old<00:01:04.610> pad<00:01:07.990> weights<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.140> had

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
piston there's the old pad weights I had

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:19.889 
piston there's the old pad weights I had
a<00:01:09.320> good<00:01:09.439> 500<00:01:10.009> miles<00:01:10.189> left<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:10.579> that<00:01:10.700> old<00:01:10.820> pad

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.340 

without<00:01:20.899> it<00:01:21.280> being<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.460> rear<00:01:22.929> I'm<00:01:23.929> gonna<00:01:24.079> risk

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
without it being the rear I'm gonna risk

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.910 
without it being the rear I'm gonna risk
not<00:01:24.530> having<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.829> center<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:26.799> shorted<00:01:27.799> the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
not having a center so I shorted the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.840 
not having a center so I shorted the
leak<00:01:28.909> coming<00:01:29.149> out<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:31.340> order<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.579> keep<00:01:31.670> that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
leak coming out in order to keep that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.830
