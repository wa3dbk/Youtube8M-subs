00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that they would come out that heist

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.469

sentence we can come up with somewhat of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.120 
sentence we can come up with somewhat of
an<00:02:13.750> idea<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.170> when<00:02:14.380> heists<00:02:14.740> are<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.070> be

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.010 
an idea of when heists are going to be

coming weeks ahead of pc i would assume

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.870 
coming weeks ahead of pc i would assume
that<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.170> least<00:02:20.440> means<00:02:20.830> two<00:02:21.160> weeks<00:02:21.400> probably

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
that at least means two weeks probably

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.690 
that at least means two weeks probably
three<00:02:22.780> or<00:02:22.810> four<00:02:22.960> which<00:02:23.770> if<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.100> was<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
three or four which if it was for it

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.270 
three or four which if it was for it

to push out a dlc for GTA online at

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.880 
to push out a dlc for GTA online at
least<00:02:37.570> every<00:02:37.750> month<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.380> people<00:02:38.590> said

they<00:02:39.010> didn't<00:02:39.250> really<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.550> anything<00:02:39.760> in

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
they didn't really have anything in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.970 
they didn't really have anything in
January<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.600> think<00:02:40.870> Rockstar<00:02:41.470> kind<00:02:41.770> of

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
January but I think Rockstar kind of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.010 
January but I think Rockstar kind of
counted<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.550> snow<00:02:42.910> like<00:02:43.540> they<00:02:43.690> kind<00:02:43.870> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
counted the snow like they kind of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.720 
counted the snow like they kind of
counted<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.410> Christmas<00:02:44.860> DLC<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.340> snow<00:02:45.580> as

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
counted the Christmas DLC in the snow as

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.000 
counted the Christmas DLC in the snow as
part<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.240> December<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.050> January<00:02:47.110> since<00:02:47.890> it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
part of December and January since it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.440 
part of December and January since it
was<00:02:48.100> right<00:02:48.310> like<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> middle<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.209> was<00:02:49.330> at

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
was right like in the middle it was at

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.910 
was right like in the middle it was at
the<00:02:49.570> end<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.900> December<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> beginning<00:02:50.860> of

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the end of December and the beginning of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.949 
the end of December and the beginning of
January<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.550> then<00:02:51.850> obviously<00:02:52.060> November<00:02:52.780> we

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
January and then obviously November we

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.840 
January and then obviously November we
had<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.530> new<00:02:53.650> console<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:54.459> didn't<00:02:54.700> need<00:02:54.790> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
had the new console so we didn't need a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.940 
had the new console so we didn't need a
DLC<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.420> then<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.870> think<00:02:56.050> before<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.709> had

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
DLC and then I think before that we had

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.949 
DLC and then I think before that we had
the<00:02:57.340> flight<00:02:57.580> school<00:02:57.940> update<00:02:58.330> well<00:02:58.570> moving

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the flight school update well moving

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.420 
the flight school update well moving
into<00:02:59.260> februari<00:02:59.709> this<00:02:59.920> month<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.340> were

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
already in people were kind of wondering

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.110 
already in people were kind of wondering
you<00:03:02.620> know<00:03:02.650> what's<00:03:03.010> gonna<00:03:03.190> happen<00:03:03.280> because<00:03:03.700> if

Valentine's Day so basically right now

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.300

there's<00:03:50.170> two<00:03:50.350> scenarios<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:50.920> which<00:03:50.950> high

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
there's two scenarios in which high

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.009 
there's two scenarios in which high
school<00:03:51.340> come<00:03:51.760> out<00:03:51.850> one<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.390> there<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:52.900> a

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
school come out one if there is a

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.540 
school come out one if there is a
Valentine's<00:03:53.560> Day<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:53.950> one<00:03:54.100> if<00:03:54.190> there's<00:03:54.370> not

Valentine's Day and one if there's not
no<00:03:54.790> no<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.300> think<00:03:55.780> what<00:03:56.080> they<00:03:56.230> could<00:03:56.560> do<00:03:56.769> is<00:03:56.980> just

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
no no I think what they could do is just

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.070 
no no I think what they could do is just
combine<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.820> two<00:03:58.000> have<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.480> Valentine's<00:03:58.900> Day

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
combine the two have the Valentine's Day

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.509 
combine the two have the Valentine's Day
is<00:03:59.110> some<00:03:59.320> extra<00:03:59.650> stuff<00:03:59.709> in<00:04:00.040> addition<00:04:00.430> the

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
is some extra stuff in addition the

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.340 
is some extra stuff in addition the
heist<00:04:00.730> for<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.000> limited<00:04:01.120> time<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:02.019> what

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
heist for a limited time but what

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.470 
heist for a limited time but what
honestly<00:04:02.709> might<00:04:02.980> happen<00:04:03.459> is<00:04:03.640> we<00:04:04.239> get<00:04:04.420> the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
honestly might happen is we get the

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.780 
honestly might happen is we get the
Valentine's<00:04:05.080> Day<00:04:05.290> DLC<00:04:05.470> maybe<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.430> friday

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
Valentine's Day DLC maybe this friday

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.060 
Valentine's Day DLC maybe this friday
and<00:04:07.239> then<00:04:07.570> potentially<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.350> know<00:04:08.380> week<00:04:08.709> later

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
and then potentially you know week later

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.979 
and then potentially you know week later
on<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> twenty-fourth<00:04:10.000> we<00:04:10.330> get<00:04:10.540> heist<00:04:10.750> I

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
on the twenty-fourth we get heist I

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.979 
on the twenty-fourth we get heist I
think<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.709> 24th<00:04:12.280> though<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.880> like<00:04:13.540> one<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
think the 24th though is like one of the

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.250 
think the 24th though is like one of the
prime<00:04:14.380> dates<00:04:14.860> for<00:04:15.700> heists<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.630> come<00:04:16.840> out<00:04:16.989> just

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
prime dates for heists to come out just

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.199 
prime dates for heists to come out just
because<00:04:17.739> it<00:04:18.070> fits<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.459> whole<00:04:18.489> in<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.850> coming

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
because it fits the whole in the coming

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.840 
because it fits the whole in the coming
weeks<00:04:19.390> ahead<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.739> fits<00:04:21.070> within<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
Day DLC it would give it at least two

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.570

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
weeks ago that if i remember correctly

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.580 
weeks ago that if i remember correctly
last<00:04:59.940> year<00:05:00.300> for<00:05:00.449> Valentine's<00:05:00.900> they<00:05:01.139> had<00:05:01.440> it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
last year for Valentine's they had it

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.550 
last year for Valentine's they had it
almost<00:05:02.430> out<00:05:02.729> for<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.090> month<00:05:03.449> but<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:04.020> think<00:05:04.289> a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
almost out for a month but I think a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.110 
almost out for a month but I think a
little<00:05:04.919> bit<00:05:05.129> of<00:05:05.159> that<00:05:05.250> time<00:05:05.520> was<00:05:05.550> because<00:05:06.000> they

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
little bit of that time was because they

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.670 
little bit of that time was because they
messed<00:05:06.330> up<00:05:06.569> and<00:05:06.719> they<00:05:06.780> wind<00:05:06.960> up<00:05:07.050> taking<00:05:07.259> some

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
messed up and they wind up taking some

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.020 
messed up and they wind up taking some
people's<00:05:08.069> guns<00:05:08.340> away<00:05:08.520> or<00:05:08.699> something<00:05:08.969> like

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
people's guns away or something like

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.450 
people's guns away or something like
that<00:05:09.090> but<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:09.960> wasn't<00:05:10.259> Alfred<00:05:10.620> that<00:05:10.710> long<00:05:11.129> so

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
that but it wasn't Alfred that long so

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.129 
that but it wasn't Alfred that long so
that<00:05:11.610> would<00:05:11.789> kinda<00:05:12.210> fit<00:05:12.659> with<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.020> whole

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
that would kinda fit with the whole

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.080 
that would kinda fit with the whole
Valentine's<00:05:13.349> Day<00:05:13.740> DLC<00:05:13.800> an<00:05:14.280> heist<00:05:14.639> and<00:05:14.909> it

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
Valentine's Day DLC an heist and it

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.209 
Valentine's Day DLC an heist and it
would<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.330> early<00:05:15.750> enough<00:05:15.840> in<00:05:16.139> March<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:17.009> where

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
would be early enough in March so where

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.390 
would be early enough in March so where
you<00:05:17.759> know<00:05:17.909> they<00:05:18.419> wouldn't<00:05:18.690> be<00:05:18.870> lying<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:20.190> guess

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
you know they wouldn't be lying I guess

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.860 
you know they wouldn't be lying I guess
you<00:05:20.520> could<00:05:20.550> say<00:05:20.849> in<00:05:21.090> their<00:05:21.270> statement<00:05:21.599> that

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
you could say in their statement that

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.209 
you could say in their statement that
they<00:05:22.080> are<00:05:22.169> gonna<00:05:22.289> be<00:05:22.440> coming<00:05:22.590> in<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:22.949> coming

they are gonna be coming in the coming
weeks<00:05:23.400> ahead<00:05:23.490> of<00:05:23.610> pc<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.150> then<00:05:24.569> moving<00:05:24.780> on

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
weeks ahead of pc and then moving on

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.420 
weeks ahead of pc and then moving on
into<00:05:25.080> my<00:05:25.229> third<00:05:25.500> candidate<00:05:25.919> for<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.219> heist

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
into my third candidate for the heist

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.519 
into my third candidate for the heist
release<00:05:26.759> date<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:26.969> would<00:05:27.120> say<00:05:27.419> februari<00:05:28.020> 17th

release date I would say februari 17th

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.100 
release date I would say februari 17th
could<00:05:28.949> be<00:05:29.400> but<00:05:29.729> I<00:05:29.940> really<00:05:30.690> don't<00:05:30.840> see<00:05:30.930> that

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
could be but I really don't see that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.959 
could be but I really don't see that
date<00:05:31.529> just<00:05:31.800> because<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:32.310> is<00:05:32.430> really<00:05:32.789> really

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
date just because it is really really

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.140 
date just because it is really really
close<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.740> Valentine's<00:05:34.740> Day<00:05:35.009> and<00:05:35.430> if<00:05:35.789> they<00:05:35.940> are

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
close to Valentine's Day and if they are

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.399 
close to Valentine's Day and if they are
gonna<00:05:36.330> be<00:05:36.479> doing<00:05:36.599> a<00:05:36.779> Valentine's<00:05:37.169> Day<00:05:37.349> DLC

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
gonna be doing a Valentine's Day DLC

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.219 
gonna be doing a Valentine's Day DLC
then<00:05:38.039> you<00:05:38.550> know<00:05:38.669> I<00:05:38.699> I<00:05:38.819> don't<00:05:39.210> think<00:05:39.779> they<00:05:40.080> would

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
then you know I I don't think they would

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:41.959 
then you know I I don't think they would
want<00:05:40.259> those<00:05:40.590> two<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:41.009> conflict<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.729> mean<00:05:41.940> really

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
want those two to conflict I mean really

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.089 
want those two to conflict I mean really
at<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.479> point<00:05:42.599> it<00:05:42.990> honestly<00:05:43.409> wouldn't<00:05:43.860> shock

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
at this point it honestly wouldn't shock

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.430 
at this point it honestly wouldn't shock
me<00:05:44.130> if<00:05:44.370> they<00:05:44.669> came<00:05:44.880> out<00:05:45.090> tuesday<00:05:45.419> tomorrow<00:05:45.900> and

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
me if they came out tuesday tomorrow and

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.959 
me if they came out tuesday tomorrow and
then<00:05:47.159> they<00:05:47.310> just<00:05:47.490> didn't<00:05:47.699> even<00:05:47.729> say<00:05:47.940> anything

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
then they just didn't even say anything

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.249 
then they just didn't even say anything
because<00:05:48.270> they've<00:05:48.419> done<00:05:48.599> in<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.779> past<00:05:48.810> with<00:05:49.229> a

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
because they've done in the past with a

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.019 
because they've done in the past with a
couple<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.770> DLCs<00:05:50.250> where<00:05:50.430> they<00:05:50.520> literally<00:05:50.789> say

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
couple of DLCs where they literally say

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.879 
couple of DLCs where they literally say
nothing<00:05:51.479> we<00:05:52.020> just<00:05:52.199> get<00:05:52.319> an<00:05:52.379> update<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.800> were

nothing we just get an update and were

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.529 
nothing we just get an update and were
like<00:05:53.009> huh<00:05:53.219> I<00:05:53.460> guess<00:05:53.699> this<00:05:53.849> is<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.029> DLC<00:05:54.509> and

me<00:06:00.120> either<00:06:00.330> but<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.810> think<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.289> 10th<00:06:01.560> in<00:06:01.740> the

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
me either but I think the 10th in the

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.830 
me either but I think the 10th in the
17th<00:06:02.340> those<00:06:02.580> are<00:06:02.729> kind<00:06:03.060> of<00:06:03.210> out<00:06:03.599> of<00:06:03.659> the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
17th those are kind of out of the

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.260 
17th those are kind of out of the
question<00:06:04.110> at<00:06:04.919> least<00:06:05.129> in<00:06:05.310> my<00:06:05.490> mind<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:06.090> mean<00:06:06.210> I

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
question at least in my mind I mean I

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.119 
question at least in my mind I mean I
think<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.690> 24th<00:06:07.139> that's<00:06:07.229> one<00:06:07.800> of<00:06:07.889> the<00:06:07.949> most

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
think the 24th that's one of the most

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.339 
think the 24th that's one of the most
logical<00:06:08.279> choices<00:06:08.849> and<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.270> third<00:06:09.539> that<00:06:10.289> is

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
logical choices and a third that is

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.260 
logical choices and a third that is
probably<00:06:10.919> the<00:06:11.009> second<00:06:11.400> logical<00:06:11.789> choice<00:06:12.029> let

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
probably the second logical choice let

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.339 
probably the second logical choice let
me<00:06:12.330> know<00:06:12.419> your<00:06:12.569> thoughts<00:06:12.599> in<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:12.960> comments
