00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
so a few people had difficulty getting

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.039 
so a few people had difficulty getting
past<00:00:04.920> even<00:00:05.310> level<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.299> uneasy<00:00:06.839> and

to play through this level I've turned
the<00:00:12.179> game<00:00:12.480> volume<00:00:12.719> down<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.920> hear<00:00:14.880> my

games you don't want to just throw

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
games you don't want to just throw
towers<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.240> willy-nilly<00:00:27.570> I've<00:00:28.189> placed

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
towers out there willy-nilly I've placed

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.420 
towers out there willy-nilly I've placed
a<00:00:29.550> laser<00:00:30.269> tower<00:00:30.689> along<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.470> long<00:00:31.679> access

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
a laser tower along the long access

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.120 
a laser tower along the long access
there<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.210> you'll<00:00:33.510> watch<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.290> fires<00:00:34.590> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
there and you'll watch as it fires it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.510 
there and you'll watch as it fires it's
hitting<00:00:35.700> three<00:00:36.360> creeps<00:00:36.920> simultaneously<00:00:37.920> it's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
hitting three creeps simultaneously it's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
hitting three creeps simultaneously it's
worth<00:00:38.670> pointing<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.680> laser

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
worth pointing out that the the laser

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.069 
worth pointing out that the the laser
tower<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.790> most<00:00:42.329> effective<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.809> it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
tower is most effective when it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
tower is most effective when it's
hitting<00:00:43.320> three<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.680> more<00:00:43.800> creeps<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> same

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
hitting three or more creeps at the same

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100 
hitting three or more creeps at the same
time<00:00:44.940> otherwise<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.629> might<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.870> well<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
time otherwise you might as well have a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.310 
time otherwise you might as well have a
blaster<00:00:46.590> tower<00:00:47.090> now<00:00:48.090> also<00:00:48.270> look<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.780> place<00:00:49.050> two

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
blaster tower now also look I place two

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
blaster tower now also look I place two
blaster<00:00:49.770> towers<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.670> put<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
blaster towers and I put them on the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
blaster towers and I put them on the
inside<00:00:52.079> elbows<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.210> turns<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> path<00:00:55.219> if

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
inside elbows of turns in the path if

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.209 
inside elbows of turns in the path if
you<00:00:56.370> look<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.760> targeting<00:00:57.739> ring<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.980> these

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you look at the targeting ring on these

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
you look at the targeting ring on these
you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.340> keep<00:01:02.340> creeps<00:01:03.920> within

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you can see how they keep creeps within

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
you can see how they keep creeps within
their<00:01:05.189> firing<00:01:05.670> radius<00:01:06.270> longer<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.200> than

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
their firing radius longer this way than

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469 
their firing radius longer this way than
if<00:01:07.530> you'd<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> outside<00:01:09.000> elbow

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
if you'd put them on the outside elbow

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.830 
if you'd put them on the outside elbow
of<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> turn<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> critical<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.610> making

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
of a turn and this is critical to making

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.170 
of a turn and this is critical to making
maximum<00:01:12.840> use<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> their<00:01:13.710> firepower<00:01:14.280> remember

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
maximum use of their firepower remember

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.050 
maximum use of their firepower remember
a<00:01:15.390> TD<00:01:16.020> game<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.759> damage<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:18.030> time

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a TD game is all about damage over time

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.140 
a TD game is all about damage over time
or<00:01:18.570> damage<00:01:19.259> per<00:01:19.470> second<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
or damage per second and you want to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
or damage per second and you want to
keep<00:01:21.390> these<00:01:21.750> guys<00:01:22.049> within<00:01:22.650> your<00:01:23.009> firing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
keep these guys within your firing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.270 
keep these guys within your firing
radiuses<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.180> much<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.570> possible<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.320> also

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
radiuses as much as possible I also

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
radiuses as much as possible I also
notice<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.729> i<00:01:26.880> put<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.509> towers<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.259> up

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
notice that i put the towers right up

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
notice that i put the towers right up
against<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> path<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:29.340> very<00:01:29.670> important

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
against the path that's very important

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
against the path that's very important
for<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> towers<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.619> use

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
for these kind of towers and you can use

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.969 
for these kind of towers and you can use
the<00:01:35.220> automatic<00:01:35.700> snapping<00:01:36.450> system<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.799> your

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the automatic snapping system to your

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.609 
the automatic snapping system to your
advantage<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.540> move<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:40.170> slowly

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
advantage if you just move very slowly

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.060 
advantage if you just move very slowly
from<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.340> valid<00:01:42.299> place<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.810> towards<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> path

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
from a valid place up towards the path

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.389 
from a valid place up towards the path
and<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.729> becomes<00:01:45.149> too<00:01:45.720> close<00:01:46.170> it'll<00:01:47.040> just

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and as it becomes too close it'll just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
and as it becomes too close it'll just
stay<00:01:47.729> where<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.360> let's<00:01:49.320> let<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.740> snug

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
stay where it was let's let you snug

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.960 
stay where it was let's let you snug
them<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.430> against<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> path<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.420> easily

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.210 

now<00:01:55.970> pressing<00:01:56.450> their<00:01:56.780> lets<00:01:57.020> me<00:01:57.200> send<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.830> next

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
now pressing their lets me send the next

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.680 
now pressing their lets me send the next
wave<00:01:58.400> early<00:02:00.730> you'll<00:02:01.730> notice<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.420> laser

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
wave early you'll notice that the laser

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.840 
wave early you'll notice that the laser
tower<00:02:03.050> was<00:02:03.410> facing<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.800> wrong<00:02:03.890> way<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.280> hit<00:02:04.820> a

whole bunch of those at one time this is
by<00:02:07.910> design<00:02:08.180> you<00:02:08.899> have<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.229> very<00:02:09.259> smart

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
by design you have to be very smart

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.130 
by design you have to be very smart
where<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.520> place<00:02:10.910> these<00:02:11.180> laser<00:02:11.450> towers<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
where you place these laser towers and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.050 
where you place these laser towers and
sometimes<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.950> work<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.400> a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
sometimes you have to work in a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.910 
sometimes you have to work in a
coordinated<00:02:14.330> fashion<00:02:14.630> I've<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:15.740> another

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
coordinated fashion I've put another

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.740 
coordinated fashion I've put another
laser<00:02:16.220> tower<00:02:16.520> here<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.030> get<00:02:17.150> these<00:02:17.300> guys<00:02:17.510> as

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
laser tower here to get these guys as

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.510 
laser tower here to get these guys as
they're<00:02:17.900> moving<00:02:18.140> away<00:02:18.230> from<00:02:18.440> me<00:02:18.800> but<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.490> a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
they're moving away from me but I was a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.980 
they're moving away from me but I was a
little<00:02:19.580> too<00:02:19.940> late<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.480> that's<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.720> bit<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.900> a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
little too late so that's a bit of a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.660 
little too late so that's a bit of a
mystic<00:02:21.350> I'm<00:02:21.440> going<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.650> sell<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.130> one<00:02:22.370> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
mystic I'm going to sell that one and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.180 
mystic I'm going to sell that one and
drop<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.930> blaster<00:02:24.350> tar<00:02:24.560> right<00:02:24.800> at<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> end

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
drop in a blaster tar right at the end

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.140 
drop in a blaster tar right at the end
and<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.840> saved<00:02:27.350> one<00:02:27.620> life<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:29.000> see

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
and that saved one life so you can see

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.640 
and that saved one life so you can see
that<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.480> even<00:02:29.630> make<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.900> mistake<00:02:30.320> here

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
that you can even make a mistake here

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010 
that you can even make a mistake here
and<00:02:30.920> hopefully<00:02:31.430> still<00:02:31.940> recover<00:02:32.360> we'll<00:02:32.690> see

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
and hopefully still recover we'll see

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.190 
and hopefully still recover we'll see
i'm<00:02:33.980> down<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.610> eight<00:02:35.180> lives<00:02:35.480> at<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.870> point

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
i'm down to eight lives at this point

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.350 
i'm down to eight lives at this point
and<00:02:36.500> i<00:02:36.709> lay<00:02:36.890> out<00:02:37.010> some<00:02:37.220> more<00:02:37.400> blaster<00:02:37.940> towers

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
and i lay out some more blaster towers

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.170 
and i lay out some more blaster towers
in<00:02:38.540> case<00:02:38.750> some<00:02:39.080> guys<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.560> through<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:41.150> i

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
in case some guys get through but i

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.670 
in case some guys get through but i
really<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.750> having<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.140> laser<00:02:42.350> tower

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
really like having that laser tower

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.900 
really like having that laser tower
there<00:02:42.950> because<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.280> can<00:02:43.400> do<00:02:43.520> some<00:02:43.730> serious

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
there because it can do some serious

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.530 
there because it can do some serious
damage<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.780> upgrade<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.209> not<00:02:47.209> enough<00:02:47.360> money

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
damage and upgrade that not enough money

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.270 
damage and upgrade that not enough money
to<00:02:47.720> upgrade<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.110> other<00:02:48.260> one<00:02:48.410> anymore<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.250> i

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
to upgrade the other one anymore but i

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.240 
to upgrade the other one anymore but i
can<00:02:49.790> place<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.600> notice<00:02:51.320> how<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.440> bus<00:02:51.860> along<00:02:52.100> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
can place to notice how I bus along the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.550 
can place to notice how I bus along the
path<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.790> dragged<00:02:53.000> backwards<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:54.230> make<00:02:54.350> sure

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
path and dragged backwards to make sure

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.030 
path and dragged backwards to make sure
i'm<00:02:54.709> lining<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.370> right<00:02:56.300> with<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.570> path<00:03:00.040> now

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
i'm lining up right with that path now

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.470 
i'm lining up right with that path now
i'm<00:03:01.160> hitting<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.489> lot<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.790> creeps<00:03:02.000> at<00:03:02.150> one<00:03:02.300> time

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
i'm hitting a lot of creeps at one time

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.070 
i'm hitting a lot of creeps at one time
now<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:06.730> these<00:03:07.730> guys<00:03:08.000> are<00:03:08.269> tougher<00:03:08.780> but<00:03:08.930> they

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
now the these guys are tougher but they

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.550 
now the these guys are tougher but they
move<00:03:09.260> slower<00:03:10.450> put<00:03:11.450> some<00:03:11.630> volume<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.170> here<00:03:12.350> now

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:26.540 

just<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.400> little

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.760 

on<00:03:26.610> this<00:03:27.330> level<00:03:27.630> there's<00:03:27.930> plenty<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.470> places

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
on this level there's plenty of places

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.610 
on this level there's plenty of places
to<00:03:29.010> put<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.340> lot<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.610> these<00:03:29.820> laser<00:03:30.090> towers<00:03:30.620> you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
to put a lot of these laser towers you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.290 
to put a lot of these laser towers you
get<00:03:31.800> them<00:03:31.920> lined<00:03:32.100> up<00:03:32.310> right<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.880> can<00:03:33.060> get<00:03:33.270> a

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
get them lined up right you can get a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.840 
get them lined up right you can get a
lot<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.600> beams<00:03:33.960> overlapping<00:03:34.850> simultaneously

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
lot of beams overlapping simultaneously

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.980 
lot of beams overlapping simultaneously
and<00:03:36.150> that's<00:03:36.510> going<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> be<00:03:36.840> pretty

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
and that's going to be pretty

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.350 
and that's going to be pretty
devastating<00:03:40.700> upgrading<00:03:41.700> rapidly<00:03:42.240> is

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
devastating upgrading rapidly is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.030 
devastating upgrading rapidly is
important<00:03:42.840> at<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.050> point<00:03:43.140> because<00:03:43.800> they're

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
important at this point because they're

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.570 
important at this point because they're
getting<00:03:44.400> through<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:46.160> there's<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.280> wind

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
getting through and there's a wind

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.680 
getting through and there's a wind
really<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.930> difficult<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:50.540> hope<00:03:51.540> you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
really not that difficult I hope you

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.220 
really not that difficult I hope you
enjoyed<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:53.390> these<00:03:54.390> techniques<00:03:55.020> will

enjoyed this and these techniques will

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.940 
enjoyed this and these techniques will
work<00:03:55.380> well<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.160> other<00:03:56.190> levels<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:58.530> fun
