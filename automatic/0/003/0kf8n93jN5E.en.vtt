 Of course, that's what it takes 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.410
 until now some highlights the 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.030
 maybe not other smartphones 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.460
 own as for example an eighth 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.140
 core processor or a dual sim 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.030
 support let us just with the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.560
 Packaging starts on the front 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.280
 we see the naming namely 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.290
 huawei as the manufacturer sng 750 is the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.570
 Product name and on the back 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.090
 we only have a few rudimentary ones 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.680
 information about the device namely we 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.989
 have here the black color variant 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.420
 present and 103 is again that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.190
 the whole of huawei technologies 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.480
 China was produced 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.980
 So let's have a look in the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.829
 Packaging we will take the cover 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.070
 from laying in the old and of course 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.659
 Immediately it radiates 750 in the eye and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.479
 We already have some highlights there 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.130
 of the device on the protective film 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.560
 imprinted namely for example a 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.580
 real synonymous because core processor with 1 7 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.770
 gigahertz per core 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.659
 that means we have eight processor cores 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.760
 stuck in this device that is one 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.290
 processor of mediathek in his 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 work also through two gigabytes 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.060
 memory is supported 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.940

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.159
 of 12 80 x 720 pixels a huge one 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.320
 3000 mAh strong battery 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.420
 a 3 2 megapixel camera on the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.549
 back a 5 megapixel camera on 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.159
 the front and of course the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.840
 mentioned tools in support us 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.700
 take it was the device lay it out completely 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.430
 short to the side around us the rest 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.760
 packaging content to look at there too 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.460
 Let's go for it and have it, of course 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.979
 We first use the warranty 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.900
 cards and a quick start guide here 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.420
 you speak in different languages 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.340
 first use should look 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.429
 because there are some special features too 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.189
 Note if you are just these two 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.409
 evening invites further we have the 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 3000 mAh strong battery 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.750
 just in the scope of delivery 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.700
 logically the power plug of it 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.010
 modular that means I have 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.620
 here on the one hand a power plug around the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.750
 I have to complete everything 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.239
 logically also a charging cable 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.129
 present here that is if I 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.930
 data and have connected to the network 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.769
 I have my charger and I can 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.379
 just the verdict now 750 charge 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.040
 that means with the usb connection I 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.549
 on this side have come the whole 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.489
 here one 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.220
 the micro usb 2.0 connection computer 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.169
 then then to the device even then 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.840
 we also have stereo headphones 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:57.180
 present in the color white with a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.969
 small remote control in the cable and the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.370
 3.5 millimeter jack and now 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.329
 of course, the device 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.069
 view I'll take the protective film 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.230
 and you can see that on the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.700
 entire front of the device with glass 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.120
 covered is that means we have from 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.180
 bottom to top toward which the glass 55 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.709
 inch large lc display protects in the bottom 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.530
 area we have three buttons namely 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.750
 the back button the home button and the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.150
 Setting button in the upper area the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.430
 5 megapixel front camera speaker 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.000
 huawei logo is clear and the resolution 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.549
 is 12 80 x 720 pixels that's us 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.859
 have a hd resolution available here 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.530
 on the back I have the 13 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.569
 megapixel camera with bsi sensor on 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.000
 small microphone over one 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.280
 Led lightning and in the lower area of ​​the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.799
 Speaker the back is removable 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.139
 is made of polycarbonate that is one 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.939
 very high elasticity plastics and 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.470
 if I take it off now and so on 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.449
 something for bending can you see that the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.040
 Logically, some things can be sent out 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.780
 which of course also be changed 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.189
 as well as the battery if times 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.840
 the skin should be able to break down 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.509
 be changed also look at us completely 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.459
 short of the device we have here 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.159
 for example, the volume control for 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.409
 volume up and went down the power wait 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.959
 to turn the device on and off 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.269
 micro-usb port 2.0 in the bottom 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.959
 area and a microphone on the left 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.449
 have side 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.569
 nothing and in the upper area have the 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.910
 Audio connection for the headphones 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:29.970
 So that's the apo 3000 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.650
 millennia strong and the lege 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.430
 I now one or before 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.720
 I 'll show you the i still the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.740
 Compatibility or go on 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.660
 for the dual sim 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.520
 that means I do not get this device two 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.539
 sim cards operate namely one 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.910
 micro-sim father 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.860
 they come in the left slot and one 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.449
 normal mini sim card that is 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.240
 that in these old cards you like them 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.849
 years ago in his phone 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.840
 or smartphones had the 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.880
 advantage of this tools 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.550
 incompatibility is that I 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.770
 two cards so the micro sim and the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.580
 minis in the same time and together 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.650
 can use 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.500
 that is one accordingly if 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.090
 I apologize for that, for example 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.280
 Accordingly, if I am to 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.570
 For example, I have a data card where I am 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.250
 then for example on the internet 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.139
 can access and I have in one 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.430
 Another judgment of the phone card where I am 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.169
 just phone over it 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.240
 that means in this case I can the 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.070
 operate both teams together 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.659
 but on the other side I can too 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.000
 two sim cards insert the self-sufficient 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.440
 working from each other that is a sim 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.539
 card for example for the private one 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.580
 use a second sim card for the 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.800
 business or just a sim card 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.139
 from germany and a sim card 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.400
 a rich country like the usa thailand 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.139
 or what ever 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.940
 I can define that in the phone 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.770
 and that means I am here 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.960
 really free together the acts too 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.969
 use or just separated from each other 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.740
 in the middle area we still have the 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.979
 micro sd card slot that means you can 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.870
 expand the internal memory of 8 gb 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.389
 and accordingly you are up to 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.729
 just under 40 gb available for one 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.919
 Support with here with a maximum of 32 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.409
 gigabyte warrants from others or 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.770
 from other huawei phone I know too 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.990
 that 64gb cards work 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.740
 it should first with a short 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.870
 Overview of the sng 750 have been 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.909
 a detailed and above all with 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.990
 a view of the surface and 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.040
 of course the dolls too 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.230
 incompatibility I show you in one 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.790
 religion that was it for the first many 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.300
 thanks for watching i am christian 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.300
 take care
