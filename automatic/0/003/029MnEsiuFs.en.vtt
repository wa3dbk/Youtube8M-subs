00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi friends this is Ignat and you are watching 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.629
 answer cus me to you such a question if 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 imagine that this melon is in my hand 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 this planet but it is an apple 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 moon how do you think at what distance 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.100
 the moon will be from the earth like this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 here can be this or anywhere here 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.189
 most of my friends whom i 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.260
 asked the same question they said that the moon 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.600
 is approximately well maybe 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 here at this distance so let 's 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
 using a sheet of paper calculator 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.609
 simple roulette we define where 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.609
 there is a moon 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.440
 so knowing the diameter of the earth which 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.390
 is 12 thousand seven hundred fifty 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.660
 six kilometers and the distance to the moon 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.760
 which is 384 thousand 400 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.430
 kilometers I got it 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.530
 the apple should be at a distance of 4 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 and a half meter from our melon 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.880
 I admit honestly I did not expect the moon 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.430
 is so far away I always thought 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.230
 that she is much closer I have not even escaped 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 this error last week when i 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.560
 did a video about how I watched here 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.680
 moon eclipse 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.979
 I think this is a mistake due to the fact that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.930
 the moon and and the earth depicts on all 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.880
 pictures are much closer to each other than 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.530
 it is actually because of us 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 a false idea is formed 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.240
 distance between them 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.520
 but what's interesting is that it would be with 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.720
 the earth if the moon were to her 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.820
 much closer actually let's say at 20 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.280
 times closer that is for our apple melon 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.500
 this distance would be about 25 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.110
 centimeters as we know the ebb tides 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.300
 caused by lunar attraction so here 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.880
 if the moon approached us 20 times 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.800
 closer then these ebb tides would be 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.630
 so huge that such cities 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.340
 such as london and new york just 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.190
 would completely hide under water under 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 gigantic tsunami so maybe for 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.160
 it's not so bad for us that the moon 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.800
 is so far away 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.180
 Thanks for watching, don't forget 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.590
 like and subscribe to my 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.870
 channel to keep abreast of my new 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.430
 also watch my videos 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.260
 other videos first 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 roller lunar eclipse about which i 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 just I mentioned that thank you very much 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.200
 looked and see you
