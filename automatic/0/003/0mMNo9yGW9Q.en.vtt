00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.240
 so hello to everyone in this video I want 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.290
 tell one warships which 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.490
 built here from let's say now on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 one of them we are 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.160
 well let's start with him that's how we are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.380
 see here two guns principle think over 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.539
 the very basis of the cannon that is here 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.119
 put dynamite 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.970
 will give room here put another one 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.769
 speaker push button dynamite 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.790
 ignites and sends this dynamite 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.379
 back towards the enemy still do not know 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.390
 on the amount laid here is not on vita 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:47.100
 make La Silla shot so well that 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.840
 look from here you can pour see 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.699
 let's say it too 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 observation so here are the boxes with 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.910
 necessary supplies dynamite and so 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.720
 further exactly the same gun here further but 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.580
 let's see another place even 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 felling observation let's say pasta or 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 what is the name I know exactly here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 we see a bow and arrow the case of which we 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 we can shoot almost the enemy here but 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.869
 in practice, I think it will be very 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 difficult but nonetheless let them suddenly 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.590
 called see the insides 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.880
 ship say so 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.689
 the main difference of this ship from 2 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 Well naturally guns and armor thickness 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.399
 this ship is wider thicker 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.450
 i.e. his armor is 4 blocks wrong 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.390
 just and punch so here we see 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 kitchen-dining room 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 the bedroom 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:12.180
 so let's go even lower here warehouse 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:14.220
 we see books and this reactor was made 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.190
 rather, for beauty, let's say this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.540
 the reactor produces energy for everything 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:33.870
 ship you too engine must be it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:35.489
 but actually we rise well in principle 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.860
 with this ship everything is clear to you 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.380
 look the other way here such will 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.209
 niche here is the second ship as we see 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.099
 exactly the same gun work principle 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:53.010
 exactly the same 2 gun more complicated so 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.470
 it is now we hear the engine it 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.410
 is down here the supplies 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.269
 if so too basically guns 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.370
 completely different here automatic 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.280
 loading volley 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.040
 and actually shells work principle 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:17.190
 so here we charge the gun so here 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.490
 way to full charge i do not 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.430
 I will 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.030
 click put the shell here click 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.880
 a button 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.530
 and then we'll see it shells reigned 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:35.050
 down after which the projectile flies away and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:43.480
 hits the enemy so here we see 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:46.530
 too, the stocks of the actors will see 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.990
 the insides the insides of our ship 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.520
 what we have well here's the first floor 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.910
 Basically nothing interesting here is not present 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.790
 except these here is where you can 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:03.220
 watch all the armor here is thinner 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:06.520
 here side armor is equal to one shooting range 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.330
 one or two two blocks we see here 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.290
 Generally in 1 that is, armor is much weaker 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.630
 it is easier to break through here as we see 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:26.430
 bedroom and small kitchen is a ship by 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:29.310
 already a little armor so free blank 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.440
 how do we see the ship's engine 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.840
 ship divisions i work like that 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.230
 way this too 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.950
 purely decorative beauty but 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.880
 it's interesting so well , basically everything 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.760
 crosses all you can say about it 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.860
 ship next video and hope 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.420
 I'll show you the real fight between the two 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.710
 ships that is create 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.550
 multiplayer game anyone 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.650
 will be 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:03.000
 about that ship and I hope for it 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.000
 all good bye all bye
