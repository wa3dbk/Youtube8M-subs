00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.819
 after months talking about him wap arrived 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.830
 our market and it has already caused a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.570
 confusion in the volkswagen line 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.210
 they even lost the lead in sales 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.240
 but Volks seems to know what it does 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.820
 modernized the 1.6 engine and wants the goal 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.859
 or with the slightly higher segment and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 no goal more complete than we take 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.390
 for today's test the rally the name fox 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 vacancy is known throughout the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.160
 as a synonym of automobile 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.320
 present on any street and up to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 on racetracks and rallies from the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.370
 old search was going through the co 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.100
 agile in Brasilia and pass that left a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.160
 Legion of fans in Brazil who enjoy 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.520
 cars with the most sportive footprint as 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.520
 family bag 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.220
 originally launched in 2004 the model 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.920
 2015 continues with the same philosophy of 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.440
 a body with 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.690
 props and mechanical modifications that the 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.670
 difference from the rest of the line and this 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.180
 year has the primacy of launching a new 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.850
 1.6 engine of the brand on the line 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 few replace the current 1.6 of eight 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.170
 valves but for now it's 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 only available on the rallye 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.509
 know the cross is all made in aluminum 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.789
 is more powerful with a series of 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.729
 such as the admission command 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.160
 to use torque and torque. 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.619
 consumer ended up getting more consistent with 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.300
 the sports proposal of the rally you 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.610
 for now he gives that differential 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.220
 that the previous ones suggest 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.460
 performance is very good and it is not 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.679
 just this among the news of the new engine 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.210
 one is that he opened a sick person when 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.789
 tanquinho for from April 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.430
 but it is something that deserves attention without 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.320
 doubt is the fuel consumption is the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.820
 better among all the cars that 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.619
 we tested until today even believe until 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.619
 Popular with motor 1.0 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.580
 the queen version based on the four model 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 doors and it differs from the outside 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:39.360
 details are Jorge because it is expensive what it is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.550
 asked 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.950
 in here the difference was due to 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.860
 of a more sporty finish in the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.200
 pedals and the name rally embroidered on the seats 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.000
 four adults and one child are accommodated 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.700
 well in this environment with materials 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.650
 quality and well done bonuses 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.050
 which still leaves a gap in the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.430
 security continues without a three 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.430
 here in the middle of the back seat 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.090
 one of the differentials of the gol rallye is 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.430
 highest suspension in 28 mm 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.840
 ideal for passing through the holes and streets 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.060
 of our roads 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.190
 to compensate for the greater height has 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.860
 and firmer shock absorbers 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.230
 unit is registered but undermine a 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.959
 little comfort on uneven floors and 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.599
 brakes and steering without the standard consume 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.030
 handicap and the manual exchange of five 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.400
 continued from the benchmark in the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.500
 Brazil by the quality of the couplings 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.430
 I've never seen a goal as sophisticated as 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 that 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.630
 seems even made in Europe is that the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.750
 factory decided to distance the model in 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.180
 price and status of the year so now in 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.670
 more expensive versions of the Gulf to prefer 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.220
 optional equipment as controller 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.140
 automatic speed sensors and sensors 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.510
 accelerate the headlights and crank the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.180
 automatic windshield wipers 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.610
 very cool because in the whole leave a 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.299
 model with face of more evolved 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.030
 the only thing is if the price is 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.630
 when he was told it will be difficult to 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.630
 to believe 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.010
 ae ap 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.010
 just cause 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.970
 Come on then you have a goal ready 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.940
 rallye equal to this crime remains cost 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.990
 exactly 53 thousand two hundred and thirty 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.420
 real 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.440
 She may be well finished, but she still is. 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.940
 a goal, right? 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.350
 of course this is also one of the versions 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.830
 more complete 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.840
 the most basic rally goes for 50 thousand 150 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.850
 but the price can also rise if you 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.510
 opt for robotic exchange said 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.610
 chan 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.280
 are almost three thousand reais more at 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.660
 The comfort of not having to change now is 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.520
 time to talk notes 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.800
 realize that they have stayed there longer 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.300
 or less on a good average we start with 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.190
 8 in performance 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.800
 soon thereafter comes a 10 more than 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.660
 deserved consumption security right not 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.000
 have a three-point belt in the middle of the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.660
 rear seat and neither traction controls 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.450
 and stability drops to 7 stability 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.660
 finish will also get 8 plus 17 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.820
 inner space and other two notes 871 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.820
