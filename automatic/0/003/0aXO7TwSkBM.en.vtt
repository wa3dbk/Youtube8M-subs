to be moving there so what you should do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
to be moving there so what you should do
is<00:02:08.489> keep<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.789> gravity<00:02:09.209> soon<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.660> all

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
is keep the gravity soon out at all

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.300 
is keep the gravity soon out at all
times<00:02:10.610> also<00:02:11.610> improve<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> also<00:02:13.160> makes<00:02:14.160> you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.390 
times also improve it also makes you
take<00:02:14.459> less<00:02:14.700> damage<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.830> if<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.920> don't<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.310> it
