00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hi to all and this is in tribute to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.009
 hundreds of millions of people that 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'm going to make this video so maybe 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.630
 people who are already more where 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.580
 still there but who suffers it is in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.530
 the tribute a person who asked me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.719
 to make a video for his mother who was 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.900
 unfortunately so today it will be 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 a special video a video a video 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 to demonstrate tobacco and problems 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.140
 that it generates over time so 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.140
 I already have to know that tobacco 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.840
 exists since 1556 finally he was found 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 in this time and since then it was pretty 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.719
 first and since until our time where 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.390
 we are now using nicotine 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.489
 to force people to flock and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.610
 rewarding with billions of 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.340
 dollars to have euros companies 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 who sell them people who have 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 nothing to do with the value of life and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 who uses the human being to be 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.870
 living or rather a life to be able to 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 get rich ie thanks to the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.199
 cigarette and tobacco and that's why 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.469
 today that I will express my 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.090
 feeling of youth serves and how 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.820
 describe that feeling where you feel 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 helpless or you feel like you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 defend you have in give you have 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.420
 want to give your opinion on the thing 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.460
 want to say that we must stop 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.990
 to smoke and so that's why I 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 made this video and I hope 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.180
 sincerely that you will have to act and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.189
 get to a little less if you 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.900
 blind to the society that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.360
 you just sell shit 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
 in short I also want to say that it is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.320
 waters contains extremely 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.640
 gore so people who have less of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.920
 12 years old I invite you to leave this 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 video I beg you it's really not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.310
 very nice to see and you will succeed 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 to be really shocked by seeing the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.890
 clips 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.649
 so that's okay listen the video is going 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.479
 start and at every check clip i'm going 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.280
 give my opinion and a slight 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.630
 description on the thing here thank you 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 infinitely and I hope that after this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.380
 video a lot of people will stop 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.290
 to smoke or will not think about 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.830
 touch of siret of envied here is 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.300
 every cigarette destroys you from 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.970
 recent scientific studies demonstrate 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.590
 that tobacco smoke attacks a gene 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.700
 vital that protects the cells 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 pulmonary cancer only one 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.640
 damaged cell is enough to develop a 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.640
 lung cancer 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.980
 so you have to know that cancer is 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.709
 actually a cell that is not going to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.510
 totally destroy actually what we 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.250
 calls the cells are made for themselves 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.900
 destroy and you enjoy restoring 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.519
 thus creating a new cell 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.379
 fully operational who will do 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.510
 operate your body normally but 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.099
 cancer is actually a pill that goes 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.230
 not be totally destroyed and in fact 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.940
 end or not at all and will become 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.590
 bad because in fact she is Russian 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.209
 useless for your body but in addition to it 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.720
 will multiply only in problems 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.459
 irreversible and if we do not cure it quickly 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.370
 you can die very quickly 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.640
 some cancers do not heal I 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.410
 have no more examples in mind but that's it 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.819
 so watch out for the cigarette all 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.140
 just the cigarette destroys the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.630
 famous genes that protect us against 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.890
 cancer and so you can know to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.280
 what time can it be 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.000
 very beneficial to smoke each 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.650
 figueiredo destroyed 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 the lungs work like 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.930
 sponges they are composed of millions 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.330
 of albums that carries oxygen jeanne 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.330
 to fluff attacks its alveoli and decreases 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.750
 the breathing capacity of smokers the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.600
 tobacco for hiller lungs but I think 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.459
 that the way fatou say so our alveoli 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.890
 serve that are located in our lungs 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.020
 in our lungs are used to recover 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.490
 the oxygen that are in the air that 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.830
 we breathe every day every minute 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.910
 at akers every second we 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.680
 to operate our 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.630
 muscles quietly and so you 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.360
 can run could swim could 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.340
 that's just smokers smoking at 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.500
 over time destroys these famous 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.970
 alveoli and therefore decreases their capacity 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.400
 of 2 endurance and physics you 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.870
 making it a bit small bit like a 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 vegetable if you prefer over time 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.220
 every cigarette destroys you 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.610
 the chemical components of tobacco 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.390
 go through your blood and cause 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.980
 definitive lesions in your eye 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.690
 we know today that smoking can 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.640
 cause irreversible blindness 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.799
 the city is actually a disease that 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.630
 actually destroys the optic nerve 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.990
 that is, the nerve is connected to the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.280
 brain so that allows us to 32 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.720
 to pass information from the 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.320
 vision to the brain allowing us to 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.880
 see so 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.200
 and if we could have sounded we can see more 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.200
 nothing basically we become blind 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.430
 every cigarette destroys you with every 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.950
 puff the smoke enters your lungs and 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.240
 forms a layer of tar 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.060
 this is a lung only voice so the 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.460
 amount of tar deposited in one year 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.450
 right now a package a day early 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.070
 from the video we could see that the 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.810
 composition of the cigarette and was 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.270
 with tar so the tar goes 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.160
 to become embedded in your body 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.030
 will cause problems like this 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.900
 we just saw, that is to say 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.610
 clogging the lungs that's very 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.110
 disgusting and it's very dangerous for 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.320
 health causing you too others 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 cancers 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.790
 every cigarette destroys you 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.810
 here is some of the aorta the artery 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.909
 main of the smoking smoke causes a 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.569
 fat deposit that can clog it's 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.659
 an order 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.550
 here is the amount of fat deposits 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.349
 find in the aorta of a smoker of 32 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.580
 years 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.289
 as you know we have a heart 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.569
 to be able to challenge the body with the 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.650
 meaning that is to say for the blood allows for 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.560
 carry oxygen 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.750
 the carbohydrates lipids and proteins in 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.150
 the whole body to be able to live and we 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.120
 so we need what are called 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.770
 arteries the arteries are the most 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.180
 bigger challenge to send back the blood 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.740
 comes the whole body and the veins the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.199
 bring back to the heart to send them 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.479
 in the lungs that allows for re 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.729
 oxygenate the whole body in fact and so 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.069
 as not being able to see on the pictures the 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.830
 sir is cause of the kinds of deposit of 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.360
 fat on our arteries so preventing 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.490
 to pass the blood and can you 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.770
 just kill next or that's 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.900
 to paralyze yourself or to cause others 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.370
 problems like for example before you 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.139
 amputate an arm ie you cut 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.940
 outright because the blood does not go over and 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.650
 the body for there is if the body could 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.909
 to call it the grangrene that is 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.319
 spread throughout the body that's why 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.779
 that it will be necessary to cut the sick part 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.819
 in short, I'm scattering and so it's for 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.840
 that that pilot is really very good 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:33.210
 for health I advise you to smoke 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.349
 every cigarette you destroy can smoke 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.180
 cause blood clots 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:38.279
 sometimes leading to bleeding 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.860
 brain 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.610
 these hemorrhages make it blind or 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.979
 paralyzed 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.060
 here is the consequence of a haemorrhage 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.319
 in a smoker 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.389
 38 years old so there you could see 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.979
 the second example of the aorta so the 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.360
 door I'll say it was the artery 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.090
 main of the heart so it's the most 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.500
 big and so that's what happens 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.379
 when we have too much cholesterol or 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.690
 other his mouth a so a passage without 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.279
 gain is therefore to offer you 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.750
 problems to the causes of problems and 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.400
 reversible like the abs and could not see 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.949
 so the person could not have become 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.469
 blind for example or be paralyzed into 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.759
 become a big vegetable or any 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:17.669
 just die here 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.139
 knowing that all things use 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.699
 so all the organs were really 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.440
 defect must be specified anyway 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.469
 listen I hope this video you 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.729
 will have opened your eyes to the reality of 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.500
 the cigarette I know that a lot 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.160
 of you we will not stop for 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.170
 much 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.640
 well listen and I hope you will live 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.800
 the maximum of time but I can you 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.720
 to say that with a cigarette your 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.490
 life expectancy decrease by almost 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.720
 30 to 40 years old so that would be a 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.850
 little bit stupid to die all because 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.890
 that you smoke a little bit knowing that 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.780
 avoid being selfish for your family 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.380
 tried to smoke away if you can not 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.510
 not stop 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.850
 Thank you all for listening to me 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.860
 I hope this video will have you 

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.800
 really more know that I had to do 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.850
 a lot of research 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.040
 Thursday usually I say no the 

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.110
 share but this time it's more for 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.790
 avoid smoking people does this 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.930
 for this not for me it's not for my 

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.200
 personal interests that I tell you from 

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.880
 video sharing but rather for that 

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.620
 let's say that all people because 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.850
 before this video do not smoke and 

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.830
 I could have saved at least 

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:17.090
 in my life this is thank you refined 

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.090
