00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.069
 like the video went and so I expose my 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.069
 the stove 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:19.939
 long burning rocket 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.939
 I have it because it was obvious razmerchik 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 the barrel on top is not that barrel which 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 fire is an air shirt 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 I have a way out 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 here is the hot air from the bottom entrance 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 cold and there stands 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.300
 the fan that drives it all 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 the case is basically a classic 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 nothing unusual the only thing I want 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.320
 share some nuances 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.649
 thanks to the nature of Ivanovich appeared in 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 this bunker boot it is he 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.979
 lets make harry not long 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.440
 special thanks to him for this shutter 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:20.280
 sandy notion ingenious so now 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.380
 next so here 's what it looks like 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 boot chamber from the inside 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 to swallow on whether there he can see 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:38.259
 but I don’t know how to make pass 12 by 13 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:41.929
 it goes to the combustion chamber but the focus 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.500
 I will find the next one if you close it 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:48.280
 almost half and here we are 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.349
 close it half 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:57.319
 it turns out there somewhere in the 6 to 13, and it 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:01.360
 such a slit imagine this 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:05.020
 enough and the amount of time burning 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.800
 burning time increases 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 for two for three hours 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.400
 and so what is loading 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.250
 to get started 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.409
 kalachev paper on the very bottom and on top of it 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.989
 some small small chips for 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.269
 guarantees still a little can splash 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:50.609
 there or oil working out literally 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:55.319
 low droplet or diesel fuel tons a couple 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:57.900
 spoons now that is my full dense 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.780
 shawl well it's not really tight and let's say 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.819
 so well, more or less on top of that is, sliver 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.260
 packed tightly normal woods 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.099
 lovers so now shutter shut and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.799
 we'll set it on fire later where do 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.299
 a long piece of newspaper set it on fire to sleep 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.939
 bottom 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.000
 where we have a newspaper 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.000
 and 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.810
 but if for a little enjoy 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.180
 that's the way the size of it on this one 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.420
 the barrel here is exactly the barrel sizes 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.700
 here is the barrel itself height 70 and diameter 36 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.290
 centimeters 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.670
 by the way the same exact size barrel 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.250
 inside this airy shirt for sure 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.470
 I have the same solid metal 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:55.060
 and she is working well I don't know 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.980
 can you hear but already heard that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.980
 grabbed for defended firewood 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.150
 Well 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.370
 just equipped here where see 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.310
 initial process later like smoke 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.840
 There is normal normal smoke because 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.840
 until the inner tube is warmed up 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.340
 when it warms up in 15-20 minutes 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.840
 virtually no home 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.880
 We should continue to be heard already fun 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.740
 buzzing 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.069
 our pussy 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.650
 You can hear I do not know, so here it is 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.389
 coming out on mode almost defining it 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.630
 just here 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:49.580
 air is pretty hot 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:56.380
 already passed the heat shop now it is 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:01.940
 think our close saw it 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:05.900
 bricks here they are so feeling cut 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.599
 cool totally nothing like here 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.500
 the gap is almost a centimeter 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:14.150
 here and it is enough and when 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.159
 develops completely there I don’t know 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.960
 where does he take the air like that pulls 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.449
 just a cow 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.509
 I mean and so I specify that's been forgotten 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:27.380
 write a pipe 150 komi and at the outlet and so 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.060
 boot camera sizes are visible for sure 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.460
 such same bochin only up 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.830
 feet standing inside the air 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.659
 shirts exactly the same here are two 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.750
 the same 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:45.169
 under it's going in camera standard 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.770
 don't remember this 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.979
 I did it all by the book rocket furnaces 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:56.300
 if that reference can search so 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:58.820
 here comes the tube inside this barrel 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:04.050
 heats up hot and went gone 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:07.830
 further gases went there and on the way out 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.770
 let's say so and I do not use completely 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.590
 all the effectiveness of this stove since 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.699
 pipe me so hot pretty here 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.530
 I tried to do 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:22.349
 long won he can see jester and then 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.710
 chimney effect is based on the principle but 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.419
 due to the fact that he and brick 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.539
 I did there but very good insulation 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:36.210
 you need to constantly get smoke out there once 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:37.889
 secondly and how hard it is to kindle here 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.789
 kindle a pleasure well, a little bit 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:44.310
 losing energy is not everything and using but 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:50.419
 but it is very convenient and cool 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.539
 I now have this all the time started 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.719
 ignition 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:57.900
 literally 15 minutes have passed I have already blocked 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:07:00.960
 Everything was now see how it can 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:05.930
 smoke from oliver jury what kind of smoke 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:09.509
 went before husband went already completely different 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.770
 somewhere in half an hour 40 m guarantees 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:15.330
 you wouldn't see him at all 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.710
 and so this download should be enough 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.740
 for about 7 hours 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.990
 then even when it goes out warm 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:28.229
 air cleaner will be used as 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:32.270
 at least an hour that is a stove very 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:35.069
 effective very, very pleased 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.830
 good luck to all 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:40.550
 If anything, write with pleasure I will answer 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.550
 to your questions
