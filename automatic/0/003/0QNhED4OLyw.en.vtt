wanting a good solid case and this case

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.740 
wanting a good solid case and this case
does<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:03.069> I<00:03:03.159> definitely<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.299> protects

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
does it I definitely think it protects

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.710 
does it I definitely think it protects
the<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:09.069> protects<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.730> iPad<00:03:10.150> much<00:03:10.420> better

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
the it protects the iPad much better

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.289 
the it protects the iPad much better
than<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.349> grip<00:03:11.829> our<00:03:12.519> box<00:03:12.849> Defender<00:03:13.269> case

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
than the grip our box Defender case

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.599 
than the grip our box Defender case
because<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.170> OtterBox<00:03:14.980> cases<00:03:15.099> does<00:03:15.310> not<00:03:15.489> have

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
because the OtterBox cases does not have

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.490 
because the OtterBox cases does not have
a<00:03:15.700> screen<00:03:16.000> protector<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.019> does<00:03:17.260> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
a screen protector and this does and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.140 
a screen protector and this does and

rocks none of this it's a really
protective<00:03:21.549> case<00:03:21.819> as<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.569> just<00:03:22.810> proves<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
protective case as it just proves the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.619 
protective case as it just proves the
water-resistant<00:03:24.430> shockproof<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.359> all<00:03:25.419> that
