it<00:05:36.360> but<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.690> think<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.230> wrestlers<00:05:37.620> obviously

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
it but I think that wrestlers obviously

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.010 
it but I think that wrestlers obviously
have<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.910> best<00:05:39.150> base<00:05:39.420> to<00:05:39.720> coming<00:05:40.020> into<00:05:40.170> the
