00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the place down there so I'm not

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.940 
the place down there so I'm not
surprised<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.200> were<00:01:22.290> able<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> find<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:22.860> as

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
surprised we were able to find one as

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890

big<00:01:25.560> piece<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> debris<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> think

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
big piece of debris so when I think

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.429 
big piece of debris so when I think
there<00:01:27.330> might<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:27.780> adults<00:01:28.110> under<00:01:28.290> there

there might be some adults under there
