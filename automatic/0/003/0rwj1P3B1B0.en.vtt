00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.560
 Hello welcome to my channel such the 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.370
 today we are going to make a recipe that 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.980
 it's delicious yesterday I went shopping 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.840
 to buy it from my week to eat and 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.590
 I came up with the idea of making some 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.140
 Rich muffins are super easy to 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.060
 doing that is what we're going to need what 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.670
 What we are going to occupy is going to be 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.420
 refried beans here I already have them 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.789
 ready if you do not know how to make them here I'm going 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.020
 to leave the league to be clicked and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.600
 go see how it is prepared 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.870
 apart from that it will occupy bolillo 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.180
 a piece of cheese that melts 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.039
 that you like in this case I 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 I'm going to use Manchego cheese but 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:52.629
 can use cheese gouda oaxaca 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.570
 that melts even the cheese that 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.710
 Sometimes they sell in small towns and that is 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.049
 it melts it looks great I'm going to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.740
 accompany these muffins with a 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:08.830
 pico de gallo with chopped tomato 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.970
 and it is with chopped tomato a chilito 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.909
 jalapeÃ±o a piece of onion a bit of 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.399
 cilantro and half an avocado or if 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.649
 they want or can take full if not 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.069
 they have this also can this 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:28.060
 Serve with salsa sauce which 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.170
 you want red green is to your liking 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.080
 let's start 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.210
 Now let's start cooking 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.880
 let's preheat our oven I'll 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.860
 preheating I'm going to preheat to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.740
 180 degrees centigrade or 350 fahrenheit 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.090
 and well here I will learn it then 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100
 what we make our muffins 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 we turn on the oven so that when 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.760
 we have them we are going to put them here 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.010
 in 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.440
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.370
 that we are going to cut our bobbins 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:08.060
 half if they're in us italian bread is 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.060
 very well played baguette we are going to cut 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.819
 It is always very good to have in the kitchen 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.709
 a bread knife because otherwise 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.709
 I'm going to show you what would happen 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.950
 more to start as being 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.269
 carrying all the bread and how is that left 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.519
 medium 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.269
 feito but good towards chamba nothing 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.269
 more than if it is a bit ugly here with the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.670
 Bread knife is well finished no 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.020
 nothing good happens to him I'm going to cut all 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.110
 the loaves 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.800
 good since I cut the loaves in that only 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.800
 I'm going to grate 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.430
 that we stay like that if they do not have an oven 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.830
 To put your muffins, I advise you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.989
 put your hot beans well 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.620
 hot and cheese do not give it here 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:07.349
 they go on it in the finite because of 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 this way the cheese is going to melt 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.840
 alone and I say in case they do not have an oven 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.510
 See how you can see it's coming out more 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.180
 finite then it will be easier than 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.459
 melts alone but as I'm going to 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.569
 put it in the oven I'm going to grate it a little 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.480
 thicker the cheese 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.950
 well I have everything ready and how 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.950
 I say it 's very easy to do 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.610
 look, I'm going to show you the difference 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.330
 between the bread that was cut with the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 bread knife and the other as seen by 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.990
 that you have to invest in a good knife 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.790
 of bread with a spoon 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.790
 I'm going to make you little beans 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.030
 and I'm going to put cheese 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.980
 so I'm going to do it to all the loaves and 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.980
 I will place them 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.100
 here in a tray that I already have with 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.500
 waxed paper or maybe they can put it 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.010
 well with nothing but so that I do not know 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.470
 I'm going to stick it with the paper I'm going to 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.140
 finish doing all and right now 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.239
 Well as since we started 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.019
 make the muffins we lost the oven already 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.620
 It's hot here I have them I'm just going 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.540
 to put here in 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.120
 more or less about 10 out of 5 to 10 minutes 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.300
 then let the cheese melt and they are 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.430
 ready while our muffins come out 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.229
 of the furnace what we are going to do is that 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.810
 here is already all chopped what they 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.680
 I had said the pico de gallo I already did 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.579
 some lines with the avocado knife 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.139
 It's very easy to do 

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:53.180
 simply mixes you add a 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.270
 little salt 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.120
 there are people who put lemon drops of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.500
 lemon but for this recipe I do not think 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.350
 to put the lemon 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.060
 then it's going to mix very well they have already 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.249
 past 10 minutes and let's see what 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.409
 chilled muffins 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.409
 I'm going to take them out and approve 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.880
 here we have already finished the muffins 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.590
 I'm going to serve you here on this plate 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.729
 accompanied by a little pico de gallo 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.849
 so that it gives little color and flavor 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:36.150
 and not this dish certainly easy to 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.490
 make quick clear if they already have the 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.110
 beans true but with that already 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.230
 they sell canned beans then to 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.409
 sometimes you have to resort to them 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.749
 look 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.749
 I'm going to approach you 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.040
 of how we were left 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.050
 before you try the dish 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.240
 I want to comment that in the comments 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.450

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.310
 recipe that has not yet been prepared and 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.370

 most people and good now 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.270
