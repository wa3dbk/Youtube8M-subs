so the industry is used to doing things

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.040 
so the industry is used to doing things
this<00:05:24.440> way<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:24.920> they<00:05:25.430> can<00:05:25.730> because<00:05:26.570> even<00:05:27.020> now

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
this way and they can because even now
