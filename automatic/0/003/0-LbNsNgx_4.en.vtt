fantastic so I'm just going to show you
what<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> DS<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.579> box<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.000> bear

what the DS can do in this box now bear

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
what the DS can do in this box now bear
in<00:01:27.240> mind<00:01:27.329> this<00:01:27.689> box<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> two<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> twenty<00:01:28.979> nine

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
in mind this box is two to twenty nine

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.550 
in mind this box is two to twenty nine
Hertz<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.000> d<00:01:30.150> DS<00:01:30.360> aren't<00:01:30.750> broken<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.170> yet<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Hertz the d DS aren't broken in yet and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
Hertz the d DS aren't broken in yet and
they<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> higher<00:01:32.130> FS<00:01:32.520> anyway<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.000> start

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
they have a higher FS anyway to start

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.660 
they have a higher FS anyway to start
with<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.620> d<00:01:34.740> DS<00:01:34.920> probably<00:01:35.250> got<00:01:35.370> an<00:01:35.430> FS

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
with so the d DS probably got an FS

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.100 
with so the d DS probably got an FS
around<00:01:35.940> put<00:01:36.120> your<00:01:36.150> 550<00:01:36.630> moment<00:01:36.930> cuz<00:01:37.020> I'm
