I'd say three or four this one the storm
uh<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> ark<00:00:56.030> actually<00:00:57.030> I'd<00:00:57.120> say<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> Covenant

close<00:06:21.229> and<00:06:21.259> then<00:06:21.590> drive<00:06:21.889> away<00:06:22.039> a<00:06:22.220> little

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
close and then drive away a little

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.710 
close and then drive away a little
hit-and-run<00:06:22.880> tactics<00:06:23.300> on<00:06:23.720> the<00:06:24.669> drones<00:06:25.669> if<00:06:26.569> you

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
hit-and-run tactics on the drones if you

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.059 
hit-and-run tactics on the drones if you
