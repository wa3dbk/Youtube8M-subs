00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.020
 ah 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.010
 do not 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.890
 good morning shakira 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.109
 see how pretty 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.300
 here we are with a guinea pig 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.820
 you know that the guinea pigs are also 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.029
 llama guinea pigs are 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.020
 originating in the highlands of Peru and 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.480
 we are going to give the first bathroom x and very 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.699
 well it should not be anything traumatic and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.129
 moreover it should not be more frequent than a 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.199
 once a month we will be very careful of 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.809
 that we do not get product or in the 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.710
 visit neither in eyes nor in ears therefore 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.449
 we will cover how well we 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.950
 it exists for when they are very little 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.350
 a powder product 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.450
 we go there have we have to try 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.090
 that is nothing traumatic for the 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.090
 guinea pig we will take and sprinkle we will 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.040
 by the back and the legs having a lot 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 careful not between us as we 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.750
 said nothing in the face 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.840
 once sprinkled we will take a 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 brush 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.650
 and let's start brushing gently 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.230
 Your first experience with the brush 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.660
 therefore always everything very slowly 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.120
 because if he takes us mania then he's going to 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.540
 traumatize for very likely future occasions 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.760
 all right 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 it's normal to protest a bit you know 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.390
 that guinea pigs vocalize in a bunch 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.520
 they make a lot of noise and this noise that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.520
 is doing now it 's protest 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.500
 even notice here this little detail 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.680
 that we are going to try to get rid of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.480
 which are remains of caritas of the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.500
 mother or litter 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.500
 let's see Gordi 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.650
 we are going to massage so that the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.650
 product 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.599
 this is so much 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.819
 in this way we are going to get it out 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.819
 well clean 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.930
 no need to wet the do not panic 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 for these noises because the guinea pigs 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.390
 they really complain about everything 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.720
 pain we will do both in favor of hair 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.720
 against the grain 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.290
 very well against the grain complains 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.680
 little bit more come let's do the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.680
 last 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.219
 very good very well 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.230
 the sample that I am leaving 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.230
 gorgeous 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.450
 the guinea pigs are herbivorous rodents and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.140
 also as we have already told you in 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.209
 Many times they need the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 intake of vitamin C the same as 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.349
 people we do not synthesize vitamin c the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.940
 rest of the animals yes so you have to 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.730
 give it every day 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.560
 fresh fruit and vegetables and as a curiosity 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.060
 We will tell you that the red pepper has a 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 lots of vitamin c 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.080
 when we do it gently, it arrives 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.480
 to please a lot they even get to 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 fall asleep 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.410
 very well 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.050
 Well, I think 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.480
 that we have finished or shakira you see what 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.890
 pretty that we've left it to the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.130
 shakira and you can go to give a 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.130
 concert
