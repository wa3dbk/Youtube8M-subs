00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.949
 basically this is going to be a gameplay of 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:30.160
 this mini game more than anything in the background 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.720
 because what we have come to take out 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.230

 It's worth to participate 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.300
 you have to 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.390
 for for the draw we are going to 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.410
 put a tweet 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.160
 on twitter and those who are interested 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.640

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.460

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.759

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.180
 of twitter on a page 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:26.860
 I do not know is a little weird but what if 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.739
 obviously we are going to take the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.420
 the ones that you have participated we are going to put 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.970
 the name on a web page that we have 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.640
 found that draws totally 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.890
 random and my job is that only 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.010
 Look, it's good that whoever says it 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.080
 randomly 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.760
 yes and we are going to put also I put a 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.330
 capture to show you that it is not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.170
 our husband 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.390
 and everything is fine and well this is all to 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.140
 not to want to make another game of 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.100
 something else or the best would leave this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.750
 video that is short so that only 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.460
 obviously good to see it 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.930
 all those who can but who 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.930
 has basically focused on 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.870
 information for the draw so nothing 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.930
 if you have any doubt or anything 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.530
 that really has not been clear to you 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.579
 that is, not only in the comments 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.150
 we will try to answer all the doubts 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.959
 and all the comments that have to 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.959
 have logic 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.900
 that is, the ones we read each and every one 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.329
 of the comments and when we see 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.950
 when we see that it is an important thing 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.090
 we have no problem answering 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.780
 so nothing if it has been clear to us 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.579
 leave them do not tell us in the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.549
 comments 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.939
 and good if also if you want more or 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.859
 this has been basically to comment 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.669
 the draw but if you want more tnt gates 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.540
 and that also we have and we will do 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:09.180
 nothing stay tuned to twitter to the channel and 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.129
 good if you liked the video or is it 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.379
 basically information is not a video 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.229
 is what you say but if you liked it 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.509

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.060

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.060
