the second in the Russian beat series
and<00:03:42.890> that's<00:03:43.890> pretty<00:03:44.220> much<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> game<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and that's pretty much the game that I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.509 
and that's pretty much the game that I
currently<00:03:45.450> own<00:03:45.720> right<00:03:46.260> now<00:03:46.470> um<00:03:48.920> but<00:03:49.920> as<00:03:50.190> far<00:03:50.459> as

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
currently own right now um but as far as

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.660 
currently own right now um but as far as
the<00:03:50.730> game<00:03:51.000> itself<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.900> decent<00:03:52.620> enough<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.459> be

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
the game itself it's decent enough to be

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.500 
the game itself it's decent enough to be
a<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:55.200> be<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.410> beat'em<00:03:55.950> up<00:03:56.129> but<00:03:56.459> apparently<00:03:57.359> it's

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
a to be a beat'em up but apparently it's

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.680 
a to be a beat'em up but apparently it's
not<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.079> mean<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:59.010> may<00:03:59.760> not<00:03:59.910> be<00:03:59.970> all<00:04:00.239> day<00:04:00.389> great

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
but honestly it kind of does a fair job

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.300 
but honestly it kind of does a fair job
to<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:04.919> certain<00:04:05.310> extent
