and it was dead

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.360 
and it was dead
it<00:00:09.360> was<00:00:09.480> completely<00:00:09.780> leaked<00:00:10.410> out<00:00:10.590> no<00:00:11.070> pressure

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
it was completely leaked out no pressure

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.520 
it was completely leaked out no pressure
at<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:11.969> Lana<00:00:12.570> from<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> thrift<00:00:13.110> store<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.410> like

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
at all Lana from a thrift store for like

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.430 
at all Lana from a thrift store for like
three<00:00:13.769> bucks<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:15.049> normally<00:00:16.049> there's<00:00:16.230> really

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
three bucks and normally there's really

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.599 
three bucks and normally there's really
not<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> whole<00:00:16.770> lot<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.039> can<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.430> these

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
not a whole lot you can do with these

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.609 
not a whole lot you can do with these
but<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> thought<00:00:18.630> hey<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.900> know<00:00:19.080> since<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.529> was

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
but I thought hey you know since it was

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950 
but I thought hey you know since it was
still<00:00:19.830> full<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.039> powder<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.609> know<00:00:21.539> maybe

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
still full of powder you know maybe

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.529 
still full of powder you know maybe
there's<00:00:22.680> possibly<00:00:23.220> some<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> refill<00:00:24.510> it

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
there's possibly some way to refill it

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.160 
there's possibly some way to refill it
myself

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
myself

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.529 
myself
and<00:00:25.260> actually<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.310> some<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.550> out<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and actually get some use out of it so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.820 
and actually get some use out of it so
what<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> did<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.080> actually<00:00:28.199> tapped<00:00:28.650> into

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
what I did was I actually tapped into

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.970 
what I did was I actually tapped into
the<00:00:28.949> right<00:00:29.070> threads<00:00:29.720> to<00:00:30.720> accept<00:00:31.080> an<00:00:31.199> adapter

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the right threads to accept an adapter

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.250 
the right threads to accept an adapter
here<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> same<00:00:33.450> ones<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.050> on

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
here just like the same ones you see on

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.280 
here just like the same ones you see on
tires<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:34.980> bicycles<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:36.140> anything<00:00:37.140> else

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
tires or bicycles or anything else

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.500 
tires or bicycles or anything else
really<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> way<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.969> could<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.239> filled

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
really so that way it could be filled

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
really so that way it could be filled
from<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> universal<00:00:40.260> point<00:00:40.670> any<00:00:41.670> compressor

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
from a universal point any compressor

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.229 
from a universal point any compressor
would<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.579> I'm<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.610> gonna<00:00:44.850> pump<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
would do it and I'm just gonna pump it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
would do it and I'm just gonna pump it
up<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.610> absolutely

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
up so you can see it's at absolutely

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.740 
up so you can see it's at absolutely
zero<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> says<00:00:48.899> recharge<00:00:50.750> yeah

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
zero right now it says recharge yeah

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.799 
zero right now it says recharge yeah
pump<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.620> put<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.399> air<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:59.809> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
pump it up put a little air in it and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.009 
pump it up put a little air in it and
let's<00:01:01.469> uh<00:01:02.300> see<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.510> thing<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.930> get

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
let's uh see if this thing we can get

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
let's uh see if this thing we can get
this<00:01:04.110> thing<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> work<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.479> it's

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
this thing to work you can see it's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940 
this thing to work you can see it's
actually<00:01:06.900> holding<00:01:07.020> pressure<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually holding pressure now it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
actually holding pressure now it's
closer<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> green<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> haven't<00:01:09.090> charged<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.420> up

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
closer to green I haven't charged it up

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.090 
closer to green I haven't charged it up
all<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> way<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> push<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.010> down

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
all the way but if we push this down

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.060 
all the way but if we push this down
there<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.439> that's<00:01:16.439> how<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> reuse<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there we go and that's how you reuse a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.780 
there we go and that's how you reuse a
fire<00:01:17.280> extinguisher<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:18.119> fill<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
fire extinguisher or fill one up and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.300 
fire extinguisher or fill one up and
actually<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.390> some<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> but

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
actually I get some use out of it but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.499 
actually I get some use out of it but
after<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> empty<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:23.970> all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> fire

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
after this is empty and all the fire

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
after this is empty and all the fire
retardant<00:01:24.720> material<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.530> gone<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.130> use

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
retardant material is gone I can use

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.920 
retardant material is gone I can use
this<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> spread<00:01:27.060> pressurized<00:01:27.600> spray

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.080 
you can just make something like that a
lot<00:01:59.100> easier<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.000> anyways<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.439> go

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
lot easier but anyways there you go

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.899
