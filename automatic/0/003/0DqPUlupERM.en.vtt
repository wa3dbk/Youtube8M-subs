00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
 but I'm not saying that this one is better 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.099
 but I will not disappear 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.000
 we will not see if there is no 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.080
 it seems that the fifth gay jury continues 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.210
 generating controversy and now over 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.910
 sum an issue and I'm going to put the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.160
 shirt of blessed tyrants to the horse 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 to the fifth jury on twitter 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.260
 It is very is very to take with tweezers 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.100
 because why 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.780
 and what can you do? 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.070
 things twitter lends nerve so much I gave myself 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.649
 account and so many things that can be 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.030
 do for good and for evil that 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.659
 put it in a program as white as 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.659
 I spotted 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.940
 it seems like a novelty and as a play and as 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 first of marcelo I have it pri me 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.920
 It seems like a barbarian but after you decide 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 twitter in big brother 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.740
 as expected in less than 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.740
 lasted evelyn in the dancing and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 counterreplica 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.230
 who incidentally grabbed her with her hair and 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.420
 was a bit against the vote in 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.780
 your distrustful intermediate teach 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.730
 Marian playful distrustful because 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.890
 You can check if you are impossible by not 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.320
 you're going to read the tweets but 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.030
 you can open the hashtags because it's 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.150
 something I anyone to see it is a give 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 I break that they are 44 masses yes but because 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.950

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.260

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.640
 that the impact you have on a 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.250
 brother did not vote for twitter is 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.730
 rotten fish in my life twitter 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.730
 tinelli 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.370
 everything we handle the tool 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:21.200
 twitter of so many years ago in 2009 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.170

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.620
 Program 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.620
 but not all 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.260
 is the orb you play and is right 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.270
 they were not the first to use the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.920
 twitter for the votes and they take 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.000
 payments in this way mouth he always what 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 dismissed Tinelli on Saturday 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.760
 especially because he understood that well 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.930
 it corresponded but so other things 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.930
 I also want to see it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.200
 blessed they do not say vote for dyes yes 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.840
 Do you want the text to remain in the panel or 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.940
 he did not say the teto medina on twitter hello 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.550

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.460
 number was terrible deletes this message 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.140
 porfa 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.030
 people vote and how our program does not 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.950
 we take do before marcelo must 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.780
 say what do you think of such a person or such 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.520
 such another but it was not definitive what 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.380
 Well, what happened was I match 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.300
 defined the people defined the fifth 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.600
 jury seriously because it defined a 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600
 score 

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.999
 they will have it as a spokesperson 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:44.009
 official but we luckily 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:46.879
 we have the text the latest 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.879
 consequences 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.569
 can not dictate since we are close to 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.550
 Christmas 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.069
 is a little bit physically tired and 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.029
 desire for all good controversies 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:17.309
 pibes like good 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:19.439
 manifesting publicly to me 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.389
 tinelli we all know he was trying 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.499
 bribing the kids who participated 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.499
 to be fans 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.210
 and there I was 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.199
 is not true 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:55.650
 the collector that says the one that says the 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.650
 first 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.310
 obviously 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:19.770
 do not make that call marcel 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.920
 but not collaborate 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.920
