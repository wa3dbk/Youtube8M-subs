00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:10.610
 I bring you as you see mac os x lion for 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.320
 pc in 9m war iii so it's going to 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.810
 work on all your computers 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.720
 that you could not or have not 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.169
 managed to install mac os x original in 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.329
 your computers, you can already, but 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.599
 through a virtual machine that is 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:30.400
 the v keep me and I recommend that you 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.340
 download this v water workstation 8 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.930
 and what you have to do basically 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.350
 First of all, download 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.280
 the hard drive of mac os x lion that what 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.370
 you can download here 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.079
 the pirate bay and I recommend this one 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.860
 is the most updated version that as 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.629
 you can see and this download jce is a 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.860
 tournament I recommend a torrent because 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.979
 if you are not going to spend half an hour and then 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.809
 this from here that is the one lock for the 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.780
 user because in signs you can 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.490
 install mac mac os x in 9 equal to them 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.799
 we have to download this good these 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.540
 links I will answer them both in the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.910
 description and basically the a block what 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.700
 what you have to do is go to a blog 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.880
 to the good in this case it would be 102 to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.040
 windows and urges the cmd to open it as 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.650
 administrator 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.830
 and you will have the possibility in the user 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.670
 when creating the virtual machine of this as 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.800
 You see that you had not before and then 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.650
 Now selection eyes you are going to create the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.940
 virtual machine you create this you put it in 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.300
 mac os x 10.7 normal without more 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:52.340
 you go to the hard drive and I recommend you 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.530
 that you put about 4 3 gigas of ram and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.590
 processors half what you have 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.520
 example if you have punctual core then 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 value you put 1 if you have 15 you put 3 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.490
 if you have an i7 you put 4 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.979
 and more than anything to make it better 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.510
 because you think it's not a macintosh and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.989
 the macintosh also consume like 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.240
 fears 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:20.030
 once done that we have everything done 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.210
 of hard drives is going to create one of 200 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.610
 gigas of these that are going to be stored 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.370
 as more saving is being filled in 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.930
 your physical hard drive 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.930
 without further ado we are going to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.720
 also in big you have to leave the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.300
 wifi all components works 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.370
 perfect to the perfection good that is 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.710
 a virtual machine so we 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.300
 the functional internet will work 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.680
 screen resolution good sound and 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.960
 It's true that some of the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.300
 Sometimes it hits you some pulls open 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.340
 many programs at the same time but 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.640
 if you want to attend fifth is why 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.100
 that is to edit music videos 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.710
 then the best operating system for 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.020
 for music and music editing 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.640
 videos and all these things and well what 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.710
 we have here to have loaded of what I see 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.550
 we do not have our password like this 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.630
 we have if not no 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.160
 and we already have loaded macintosh you can 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.220
 watch 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.410
 if you remove this 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.220
 we have as you see busy absolutely 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.850
 all the screen resolution and it goes very 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.950
 well, it's pretty light, like you can 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.840
 watch 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.790
 as I said, sometimes 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.849
 hang up and that but let's go 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.840
 well by that way rather pretty fine the 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:47.050
 true 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.900
 here would have our hard drive this is 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.050
 as all normal applications 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.080
 open the asset 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.050
 tribune to see things and then in 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.520
 As for the configuration, here already 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.530
 you put our parameters will put you 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.780
 a bad resolution we go on a reason 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.250
 option of 1024 then change it here 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.840
 there is yours and you have maximum 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.390
 HD is super to call it that 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.530
 we go that the normal thing is that it arrives until 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.919
 here is full hd 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.010
 and well more things the sound already works 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.950
 all good 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.160
 and well, this was more or less a 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.730
 video tutorial on how to install 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.500
 macintosh on our pc with v-power and 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.090
 Well I hope that it has served you 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.640
 the macintosh lovers that you can us 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.580
 spend on a macintosh since they are 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.260
 extremely lacking and good and this 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.260
 it's all and even another goodbye
