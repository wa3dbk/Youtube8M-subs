00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
disorders that affect humans there are

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.130 
disorders that affect humans there are
chemicals<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.420> are<00:02:32.780> differentially

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
chemicals that are differentially

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.250 
chemicals that are differentially
distributed<00:02:33.980> in<00:02:34.549> these<00:02:34.819> two<00:02:35.060> tissues<00:02:35.480> are<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
distributed in these two tissues are the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.620 
distributed in these two tissues are the
very<00:02:36.440> chemicals<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.090> brain<00:02:38.330> does

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
very chemicals with which the brain does

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.050 
very chemicals with which the brain does
its<00:02:38.810> communicating<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:40.130> turns<00:02:40.459> out<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.880> in

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
its communicating it turns out that in

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.360 
its communicating it turns out that in
the<00:02:41.150> basal<00:02:41.450> ganglia<00:02:41.510> there<00:02:42.170> are<00:02:42.380> different

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
the basal ganglia there are different

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.520 
the basal ganglia there are different
pathways<00:02:44.090> different<00:02:45.080> nerve<00:02:45.230> circuits

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
pathways different nerve circuits

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.559 
pathways different nerve circuits
different<00:02:46.130> neural<00:02:46.310> circuits<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.360> are

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
different neural circuits that are

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.110 
different neural circuits that are
basically<00:02:48.170> competing<00:02:48.739> with<00:02:48.890> one<00:02:49.130> another<00:02:49.190> do

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
basically competing with one another do

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.410 
basically competing with one another do
it<00:02:50.269> don't<00:02:50.840> do<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.010> more<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.940> less<00:02:53.150> and

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
it don't do it do it more do it less and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.740 
it don't do it do it more do it less and
so<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.709> some<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.069> these<00:02:55.329> disorders<00:02:56.329> I<00:02:56.510> think

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
so for some of these disorders I think

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.589 
so for some of these disorders I think
they<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.230> more<00:02:57.680> pathways<00:02:58.209> become<00:02:59.209> dominant

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
they do it more pathways become dominant

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.289 
they do it more pathways become dominant
so<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.530> fact<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.130> keep<00:03:01.459> releasing<00:03:01.819> the

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
so in fact you just keep releasing the

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.180 
so in fact you just keep releasing the
behavior<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.870> case<00:03:03.019> of<00:03:03.170> Parkinson's<00:03:03.709> kind

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
behavior in the case of Parkinson's kind

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.340 
behavior in the case of Parkinson's kind
of<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.340> opposite<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.540> don't<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:06.079> enough

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
of the opposite you don't do it enough

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.830 
of the opposite you don't do it enough
and<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.160> little<00:03:07.430> compartments<00:03:08.180> we<00:03:08.359> found<00:03:08.630> we

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and the little compartments we found we

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.270 
and the little compartments we found we
think<00:03:09.140> are<00:03:09.489> part<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.609> evaluator<00:03:11.359> system

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
think are part of that evaluator system

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.120 
think are part of that evaluator system
and<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> other<00:03:13.579> half<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.090> our<00:03:14.209> work<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.739> how

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
and the other half of our work is on how

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.030 
and the other half of our work is on how
we<00:03:16.609> develop<00:03:17.060> habits<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:18.109> turns<00:03:18.319> out<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.980> a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
we develop habits it turns out that a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.069 
we develop habits it turns out that a
lot<00:03:19.130> of<00:03:19.280> our<00:03:19.459> habits<00:03:19.819> are<00:03:20.000> learned<00:03:20.299> we<00:03:21.049> have

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
lot of our habits are learned we have

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.199 
lot of our habits are learned we have
many<00:03:21.769> different<00:03:21.859> experiments<00:03:22.280> going<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:22.910> in

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
many different experiments going on in

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.289 
many different experiments going on in
the<00:03:23.329> lab<00:03:23.540> where<00:03:23.840> little<00:03:24.109> mice<00:03:24.319> or<00:03:24.709> rats<00:03:25.489> learn

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
the lab where little mice or rats learn

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.080 
the lab where little mice or rats learn
routines<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.590> behavior<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.730> they<00:03:28.910> usually

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
routines of behavior and they usually

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.599 
routines of behavior and they usually
learn<00:03:29.359> them<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.959> get<00:03:30.139> reward<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.340> turns

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
learn them to get reward and it turns

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.720 
learn them to get reward and it turns
out<00:03:31.819> these<00:03:31.970> deep<00:03:32.269> parts<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.019> brain

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
out these deep parts of the brain

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.229 
out these deep parts of the brain
probably<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:35.660> part<00:03:36.109> our<00:03:36.790> evaluation<00:03:37.790> systems

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
probably in part our evaluation systems

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.349 
probably in part our evaluation systems
so<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.260> do<00:03:39.410> something<00:03:39.859> seems<00:03:40.819> pretty<00:03:41.030> good

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
so you do something seems pretty good

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.110 
so you do something seems pretty good
gives<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.319> some<00:03:42.500> reward<00:03:42.889> so<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.549> tend<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:43.970> do

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
gives you some reward so you tend to do

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.240 
gives you some reward so you tend to do
it<00:03:44.239> again<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.720> we<00:03:45.019> think<00:03:45.410> these<00:03:45.620> deep<00:03:45.889> parts

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
it again and we think these deep parts

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.870 
it again and we think these deep parts
of<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.459> brain<00:03:46.670> are<00:03:47.389> critical<00:03:47.989> for<00:03:48.350> that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
of the brain are critical for that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.280 
of the brain are critical for that
evaluation<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.799> eventual<00:03:51.799> stamping<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.670> of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
evaluation and eventual stamping in of

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.330 
evaluation and eventual stamping in of
habits<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.470> routines<00:03:55.450> we<00:03:56.450> would<00:03:57.040> just<00:03:58.040> love

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
habits and routines we would just love

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.479 
habits and routines we would just love
to<00:03:58.400> know<00:03:58.760> enough<00:03:59.150> about<00:04:00.049> how<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.920> plasticity

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
to know enough about how the plasticity

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.509 
to know enough about how the plasticity
of<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.880> basal<00:04:02.239> ganglia<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.650> modify

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
of the basal ganglia that is the modify

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.840 
of the basal ganglia that is the modify
ability<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.239> these<00:04:05.440> systems<00:04:06.440> how<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.400> modify

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
ability of these systems how that modify

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.550 
ability of these systems how that modify
ability<00:04:08.329> can<00:04:08.799> find<00:04:09.799> too

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
ability can find too

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.390 
ability can find too
thoughts<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.880> feelings<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.050> movements<00:04:13.830> we

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
thoughts and feelings and movements we

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.340 
thoughts and feelings and movements we
think<00:04:14.640> we<00:04:14.790> can<00:04:15.000> get<00:04:15.150> close<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.260> we

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
think we can get close to that but we

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.620 
think we can get close to that but we
think<00:04:16.380> we're<00:04:16.680> gonna<00:04:16.799> have<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.100> combine

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
think we're gonna have to combine

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.590 
think we're gonna have to combine
molecular<00:04:18.630> biology<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:20.100> bunch<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.600> systems

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
molecular biology and a bunch of systems

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.750 
molecular biology and a bunch of systems
neuroscience<00:04:22.079> methods<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.220> hit<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.610> an

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
neuroscience methods if you hit on an

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.330 
neuroscience methods if you hit on an
important<00:04:24.180> gene<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.020> really<00:04:25.800> hope<00:04:25.950> we<00:04:26.010> have

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
important gene and I really hope we have

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.230 
important gene and I really hope we have
then<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.960> gene<00:04:28.320> opens<00:04:29.070> all<00:04:29.430> kinds<00:04:30.150> of

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
then that gene opens all kinds of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.350 
then that gene opens all kinds of
pathways<00:04:30.830> into<00:04:31.830> mechanisms<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.910> that

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
pathways into mechanisms that that

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.920 
pathways into mechanisms that that
produce<00:04:33.720> disorders<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:35.070> affect<00:04:35.190> us<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:35.930> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
produce disorders that affect us so so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.210 
produce disorders that affect us so so
these<00:04:37.080> are<00:04:37.260> very<00:04:37.700> powerful<00:04:38.700> ways<00:04:38.910> in<00:04:39.600> which<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
these are very powerful ways in which a

these are very powerful ways in which a
