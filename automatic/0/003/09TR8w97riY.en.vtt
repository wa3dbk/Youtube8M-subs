00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.450
 and so on 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 work down and be and there on the agenda 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:28.040

 and he can go to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.059
 jan terlouw 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.059
 that is 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 6 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.019
 4 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.779
 c 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.169
 all those demands a society 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.659
 ballast outside the posts 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.900
 operation 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.559
 he has his own e-mail premises, both are in his own words 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.589
 although most of all were out 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.109
 therefore not 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.059
 old 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.200
 at the pumping station 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.669
 it is always against it 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.669
 roj 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
 see both parties 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.269
 a stone with the man 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.879
 also look at the cart the south what do you think 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.699
 Then you are 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.629
 and what appears further up 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.140
 it became one 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.479
 an older couple 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.479
 it's just my head 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.099
 this shows that the Koran 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.899
 we have thereby 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.149
 be saved in the nick of time 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.229
 the world 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.989
 with me to solve this 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.989
 when you in the Netherlands also something 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.909
 culemborg 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.199
 didier boxers with the power 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.559
 audience 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.229
 buemi is by the place 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.179
 that's almere 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:03.159
 and that becomes variola 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.369
 ours at a time 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:07.229
 with lots of color 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:12.019
 there you can look at mario there is borsato and humor again and it shows 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.139
 Miami proclaimed that shows when the door of an attack 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.139
 because for example 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.319
 recognition 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 rabobank 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.870
 with his bed either 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.189
 8 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.619
 it not at ds it not there is nothing and 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.680
 it not the other man 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.370
 therefore one can 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.199
 the rest have their own radio channel 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.520
 no, it is not 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.759
 productions 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.620
 So the running of both were FC Twente before the outage 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.219
 I will do that myself 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.739
 manager and then know better than the duel after which cars gent 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.900
 where the car factories have 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 deventer 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.540
 but we have almost finished one of the few stocks 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.059
 the that the year of my children 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.939
 and keep an eye on a fire in a home 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.779
 there were two Palestinians 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.300
 but where
