always going to be a lot of information

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.179 
always going to be a lot of information
and<00:00:30.149> for<00:00:30.930> most<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.290> us<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.739> wanted<00:00:31.950> to<00:00:32.070> get

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and for most of us what we wanted to get

and for most of us what we wanted to get
out<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> was<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:32.940> clinically<00:00:33.480> relevant

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

the highlight of the Congress was a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.760 
the highlight of the Congress was a
presentation<00:00:52.800> by<00:00:52.829> dr.<00:00:53.010> yet<00:00:53.579> vandewalle<00:00:54.770> he's

presentation by dr. yet vandewalle he's
a<00:00:55.800> gross<00:00:56.100> anatomist<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.060> he<00:00:57.989> encourages<00:00:58.590> us

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
a gross anatomist and he encourages us

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.880 
a gross anatomist and he encourages us
to<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> architecture<00:01:00.540> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.560> whole

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to look at the architecture of the whole

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
to look at the architecture of the whole
facial<00:01:02.220> system<00:01:02.730> rather<00:01:02.880> than<00:01:03.120> considering<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
facial system rather than considering it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.280 
facial system rather than considering it
in<00:01:04.110> parts<00:01:04.619> his<00:01:05.489> ideas<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.060> challenged<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
in parts his ideas really challenged the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
in parts his ideas really challenged the
commonly<00:01:07.710> held<00:01:07.829> beliefs<00:01:08.729> about<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
commonly held beliefs about the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
commonly held beliefs about the
relationship<00:01:09.780> between<00:01:09.810> ligaments<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
relationship between ligaments and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.420 
relationship between ligaments and
muscles<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.450> encourages<00:01:12.960> us<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.280> try<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
muscles and he encourages us to try and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.010 
muscles and he encourages us to try and
understand<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> fascist<00:01:15.720> should<00:01:15.869> be

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
understand where the fascist should be

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
understand where the fascist should be
sliding<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:16.950> where<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> should<00:01:17.490> be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
sliding and where it should be

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.120 
sliding and where it should be
transferring<00:01:18.450> stream<00:01:20.210> my<00:01:21.210> best<00:01:21.420> moment<00:01:21.749> was

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
transferring stream my best moment was

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.520 
transferring stream my best moment was
young<00:01:23.130> yup<00:01:23.609> bundoora<00:01:24.210> wall<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> idea

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
young yup bundoora wall and the idea

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.730 
young yup bundoora wall and the idea
that<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.950> ligaments<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:28.289> muscles<00:01:28.619> are

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that the ligaments that the muscles are

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
that the ligaments that the muscles are
linked<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.700> sequence<00:01:30.179> between<00:01:30.359> two<00:01:30.689> ligaments

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
linked in sequence between two ligaments

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.399 
linked in sequence between two ligaments
I<00:01:31.289> think<00:01:32.219> the<00:01:32.280> highlight<00:01:32.659> came<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> second

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
I think the highlight came on the second

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.429 
I think the highlight came on the second
day<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.709> yeah<00:01:35.249> vanderwal<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.840> kind

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
day with yeah vanderwal and he was kind

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.859 
day with yeah vanderwal and he was kind
of<00:01:37.560> quite<00:01:37.889> paradigm<00:01:38.429> shifting<00:01:38.969> I<00:01:39.179> guess

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of quite paradigm shifting I guess

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.730 
of quite paradigm shifting I guess
rather<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.590> viewing<00:01:40.799> things<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.850> terms<00:01:42.179> of

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
rather than viewing things in terms of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.289 
rather than viewing things in terms of
parallel<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.969> arrangement<00:01:44.969> there<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.209> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
parallel and arrangement there in a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.499 
parallel and arrangement there in a
series<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> arrangement<00:01:46.529> in<00:01:46.619> terms<00:01:46.829> of

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
series and arrangement in terms of

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.599 
series and arrangement in terms of
structures<00:01:48.509> around<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.899> joint<00:01:49.139> and<00:01:49.609> the

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
structures around the joint and the

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.279 
structures around the joint and the
sweet<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.029> about<00:01:51.209> that<00:01:51.389> is<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.749> the

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
sweet thing about that is that the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.739 
sweet thing about that is that the
ligaments<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.069> be<00:01:53.279> dynamically<00:01:54.060> stabilizing

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
ligaments can be dynamically stabilizing

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:56.120 
ligaments can be dynamically stabilizing
the<00:01:54.840> joint<00:01:55.049> no<00:01:55.229> matter<00:01:55.469> what<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> angle<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the joint no matter what the angle of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.059 
the joint no matter what the angle of

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
van der Waal we can see how

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.929 
van der Waal we can see how
interconnected<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.709> fissure<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> around<00:02:02.789> the

floating freely above it so it's kind of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.350 
floating freely above it so it's kind of
a<00:02:39.950> bit<00:02:40.159> crude<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.180> one

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
what its functional task is so it seems

what its functional task is so it seems

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
facial research conference in 2007 so it

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.539 
facial research conference in 2007 so it
seems<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.840> be<00:03:35.959> feeling<00:03:36.109> clear<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:37.250> there<00:03:37.459> is

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
seems to be feeling clear that there is

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.210 
seems to be feeling clear that there is
a<00:03:37.579> nonlinear<00:03:38.540> strain<00:03:39.230> transmission<00:03:39.919> through

the<00:03:44.020> force<00:03:44.230> transmission<00:03:44.740> is<00:03:45.130> probably<00:03:46.030> quite

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
the force transmission is probably quite

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.790 
the force transmission is probably quite
different<00:03:46.840> from<00:03:47.110> what<00:03:47.320> we<00:03:47.440> think<00:03:47.680> and

different from what we think and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.940 
different from what we think and
certainly<00:03:48.460> can't<00:03:48.670> be<00:03:48.850> viewed<00:03:49.150> as<00:03:49.590> force<00:03:50.590> into

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
certainly can't be viewed as force into

certainly can't be viewed as force into
