00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.940 
accurate this firearm is from 21 feet so
you<00:03:22.160> can<00:03:22.430> see<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.150> Ruger<00:03:23.570> LCR<00:03:24.049> can<00:03:24.470> be<00:03:24.590> shot

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
you can see the Ruger LCR can be shot

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.910 
you can see the Ruger LCR can be shot
fairly<00:03:25.880> accurately<00:03:26.390> at<00:03:26.720> close<00:03:27.019> range<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.739> this

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
fairly accurately at close range so this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.800 
fairly accurately at close range so this
is<00:03:28.160> difficult<00:03:28.489> gun<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.060> shoot<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.600> does

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
is difficult gun to shoot and it does

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.410 
is difficult gun to shoot and it does
require<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.230> lot<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.470> practice<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:32.090> know<00:03:32.239> we're

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
require a lot of practice you know we're

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.060 
require a lot of practice you know we're
only<00:03:32.570> dealing<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.230> with<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.470> barrel<00:03:33.920> that's

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
only dealing here with a barrel that's

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.699 
only dealing here with a barrel that's
less<00:03:34.340> than<00:03:34.580> two<00:03:34.760> inches<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.360> about<00:03:35.570> 1.8<00:03:36.380> 5

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
less than two inches it's about 1.8 5

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.920 
less than two inches it's about 1.8 5
inches<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.540> makes<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.900> difference

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
inches so that really makes a difference

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.890 
inches so that really makes a difference
in<00:03:39.470> comparison<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.400> barrel<00:03:40.880> that's<00:03:41.570> three

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
in comparison to a barrel that's three

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.280 
in comparison to a barrel that's three
inches<00:03:42.140> long<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.330> difficult<00:03:44.750> gun<00:03:45.170> to

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
inches long so it is a difficult gun to

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.050 
inches long so it is a difficult gun to
fire<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:45.980> do<00:03:46.160> need<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.459> practice<00:03:46.670> with

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
fire and you do need to practice with

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.310 
fire and you do need to practice with
this<00:03:47.239> gun<00:03:47.480> if<00:03:47.630> you're<00:03:47.750> going<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.959> carry<00:03:48.230> it

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
this gun if you're going to carry it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.650 
this gun if you're going to carry it
however<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.100> accurate<00:03:49.730> for<00:03:49.910> its<00:03:50.330> intended

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
however it is accurate for its intended

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.410 
however it is accurate for its intended
purpose<00:03:50.840> which<00:03:51.410> is<00:03:51.440> about<00:03:51.830> 21<00:03:52.340> feet<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.910> it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
purpose which is about 21 feet and it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.570 
purpose which is about 21 feet and it
certainly<00:03:53.780> will<00:03:54.140> go<00:03:54.650> into<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.100> silhouette<00:03:55.549> of

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
certainly will go into the silhouette of

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.080 
certainly will go into the silhouette of
a<00:03:55.790> person<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.739> from<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.860> standpoint<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
a person so from that standpoint the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.240 
a person so from that standpoint the
accuracy<00:03:59.600> in<00:03:59.780> comparison<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.530> other<00:04:00.709> ones<00:04:01.010> is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
accuracy in comparison to other ones is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.150 
accuracy in comparison to other ones is
quite<00:04:01.610> good<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.630> from<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.170> art<00:04:03.380> factor<00:04:03.920> for

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
quite good so from the art factor for

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.660 
quite good so from the art factor for
accuracy<00:04:04.790> I'm<00:04:05.000> going<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.180> give<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.480> 4.5<00:04:06.490> it's

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670
