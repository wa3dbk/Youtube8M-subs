what the hell is bad oh my skittles i

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269 
what the hell is bad oh my skittles i
thought<00:00:24.899> i<00:00:24.930> deleted<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.500> those<00:00:25.710> wonder<00:00:26.220> how

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
thought i deleted all those wonder how

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.900 
thought i deleted all those wonder how
they<00:00:26.399> ended<00:00:26.579> up<00:00:26.669> here<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.869> made<00:00:28.230> those<00:00:28.500> Oh

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
they ended up here you made those Oh

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.700 
they ended up here you made those Oh
what<00:00:29.910> well<00:00:30.509> it<00:00:31.020> all<00:00:31.110> started<00:00:31.469> when<00:00:31.559> I<00:00:31.680> was

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
what well it all started when I was

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
what well it all started when I was
doing<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.130> algorithms<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.880> antivirus

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
doing some algorithms for antivirus

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
doing some algorithms for antivirus
software<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.770> program<00:00:35.129> will<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.340> designed

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
software this program will be designed

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.150 
software this program will be designed
so<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.270> auto<00:00:36.600> reason<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.500> anger<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so that it would auto reason to anger in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.550 
so that it would auto reason to anger in
order<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> defend<00:00:38.730> itself<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.720> programmed<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
order to defend itself you programmed it

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.250 
order to defend itself you programmed it
to<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.920> angry<00:00:41.540> she<00:00:42.540> should<00:00:42.720> be<00:00:42.840> fine<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.230> long

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
to be angry she should be fine as long

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.530 
to be angry she should be fine as long
as<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> maintains<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:44.040> distance<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
as it maintains a distance and if it

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.100 
as it maintains a distance and if it
doesn't<00:00:46.670> termination<00:00:47.670> termination<00:00:48.540> that<00:00:48.990> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
doesn't termination termination that is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.790 
doesn't termination termination that is
just<00:00:49.380> great<00:00:50.750> fantastic<00:00:51.750> why<00:00:52.140> why<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.650> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
just great fantastic why why do you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
just great fantastic why why do you
always<00:00:52.920> make<00:00:53.190> these<00:00:53.400> ridiculous<00:00:54.060> tests<00:00:54.570> what

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
always make these ridiculous tests what

00:00:55.440 --> 00:03:41.300 
always make these ridiculous tests what
he<00:00:55.620> always<00:00:55.770> yell<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.310> me

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.770 

just<00:03:42.310> admit<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.850> test<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.330> mine<00:03:43.540> actually

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
just admit it a test of mine actually

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.810 
just admit it a test of mine actually
worked<00:03:44.230> for<00:03:44.350> one<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.980> shut<00:03:45.190> up<00:03:45.220> for<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.520> second

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
worked for one you shut up for a second

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.190 
worked for one you shut up for a second
we<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.030> slightly<00:03:46.480> more<00:03:46.720> pressing<00:03:47.080> issue

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
we have a slightly more pressing issue

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.530 
we have a slightly more pressing issue
at<00:03:47.410> hand<00:03:47.440> she'll<00:03:48.340> be<00:03:48.370> fine<00:03:48.760> she<00:03:49.180> can<00:03:49.210> clearly

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
at hand she'll be fine she can clearly

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.390 
at hand she'll be fine she can clearly
adapt<00:03:49.960> if<00:03:50.230> she's<00:03:50.410> smart<00:03:50.530> enough<00:03:50.740> she'll<00:03:51.130> avoid

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
adapt if she's smart enough she'll avoid

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.310 
adapt if she's smart enough she'll avoid
anything<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.910> may<00:03:52.030> hurt<00:03:52.240> her<00:03:52.390> that's<00:03:52.990> not<00:03:53.230> what

anything to may hurt her that's not what
I'm<00:03:53.440> worried<00:03:53.710> about<00:03:53.770> its<00:03:54.250> movements<00:03:54.790> almost

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
I'm worried about its movements almost

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.930 
I'm worried about its movements almost
seemed<00:03:55.510> human<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:57.040> keeps<00:03:57.280> climbing<00:03:57.640> up

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
seemed human and it keeps climbing up

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:08.190 
seemed human and it keeps climbing up
where<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.390> it<00:03:58.510> going<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:07.450> is<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.690> sale<00:04:07.959> was

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
where is it going what is the sale was

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.470 
where is it going what is the sale was
programmed<00:04:08.620> for<00:04:08.800> anyway<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.970> real<00:04:10.209> world

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480

sentient AI when we found one I didn't

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.620 
sentient AI when we found one I didn't
think<00:04:14.860> we'd<00:04:15.070> actually<00:04:15.130> ever<00:04:15.790> find<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.420> though

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.449 
think we'd actually ever find one though
this<00:04:17.200> looks<00:04:17.380> nothing<00:04:17.650> like<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.070> real<00:04:18.100> world

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
this looks nothing like the real world

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.009 
this looks nothing like the real world
it's<00:04:18.700> still<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.299> process<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.780> being<00:04:19.959> built

it's<00:04:20.620> probably<00:04:20.769> had<00:04:21.040> this<00:04:21.160> AI<00:04:21.370> got<00:04:21.700> in<00:04:21.880> found

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
it's probably had this AI got in found

some loose file link or something why do

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.030 
some loose file link or something why do
we<00:04:24.550> need<00:04:24.669> this<00:04:24.820> world<00:04:25.120> for<00:04:25.419> her<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:26.650> was<00:04:26.830> built

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
we need this world for her it was built

we need this world for her it was built
