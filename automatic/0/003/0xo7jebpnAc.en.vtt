kott photo got a cute idea so what this

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.360 
kott photo got a cute idea so what this
item<00:00:33.180> master<00:00:33.300> does<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.230> lures<00:00:34.860> enemies

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.369 
item master does is it lures enemies
into<00:00:35.719> specific<00:00:36.719> areas<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.500> user<00:00:37.620> choice

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
into specific areas of the user choice

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
into specific areas of the user choice
so<00:00:40.379> noisy<00:00:40.710> Moe<00:00:40.890> Bock's<00:00:41.040> Kaiba<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.180> know

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so noisy Moe Bock's Kaiba and you know

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.740 
so noisy Moe Bock's Kaiba and you know
she's<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.770> marker<00:00:44.180> which<00:00:45.180> attach<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> towel

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
she's your marker which attach the towel

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
she's your marker which attach the towel
so<00:00:45.960> they<00:00:45.989> either<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.530> move<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> think

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
so they either don't move on so I think

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.779 
so they either don't move on so I think
if<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.719> effectively<00:00:49.200> use<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.890> item<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
if we can effectively use this item it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.540 
if we can effectively use this item it
will<00:00:51.059> probably<00:00:51.480> help<00:00:51.719> us<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.350> terms<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.829> trying

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
will probably help us in terms of trying

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.510 
will probably help us in terms of trying
