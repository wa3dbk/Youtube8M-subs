00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 I have been around for the October book 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.489
 away for the stages with the dark and the evenings 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.030
 in the middle of the week when I was at 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.520
 home 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 I tried to see them but they were well who 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.379
 visas no maximum duration of one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.470
 minute they were type 3 oct I would like to say 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 however, you work around 350 360 videos 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.320
 so they were really data to see 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.339
 everyone wanted to thank every person 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.770

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.449
 practically here comes out that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.399
 hateful screen for spam 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.229
 there I have to enter the certain code 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.690
 digits leaker makes me not able to 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 understand they make them too complicated and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.280
 so he finally gave up also 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 I thank everyone for participating 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.929

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 written under olympic thanks though there 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.340
 I saw all the many videos I reviewed 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 several times because obviously I looked at them 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.840
 we draw the ones I like about 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.789
 more then revise was a short 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.590
 work neither because I wanted 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.479
 I didn't want to choose carefully 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.610
 to make choices so thrown away by 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.720
 this to give 339 in short, see you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.209
 in place 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.330
 so no more talk and I would say that 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.830
 immediately start telling you the third 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.280

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.280
 first three classified 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.590
 how to organize this thing in the box 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.630

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.400
 I arrived by selection let's say 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.060

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.670
 for serious and certain that they have me 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.250
