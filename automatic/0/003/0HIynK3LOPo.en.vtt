the cart was getting some paint made up
and<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.610> thought<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:15.089> Co<00:00:15.420> cutting<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and I thought about Co cutting out the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.220 
and I thought about Co cutting out the
table<00:00:16.289> saw<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.310> hit<00:00:17.490> me<00:00:17.609> then<00:00:17.840> DIY<00:00:18.840> Tyler

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
table saw and it hit me then DIY Tyler

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
table saw and it hit me then DIY Tyler
this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.789> business<00:00:20.970> around

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
this is not how we do business around

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.500 
this is not how we do business around
here<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> went<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.289> got<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.769> $7<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> $0.14

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
here so I went and got two $7 and $0.14

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.330 
here so I went and got two $7 and $0.14
one<00:00:24.750> by<00:00:24.900> eights<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> try<00:00:26.310> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
one by eights and I'm going to try to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.820 
one by eights and I'm going to try to
make<00:00:26.519> our<00:00:26.580> own<00:00:26.730> Colt<00:00:27.150> molding<00:00:27.769> hopefully<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
make our own Colt molding hopefully it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.759 
make our own Colt molding hopefully it
works<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.300> plan<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:31.230> got<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
works out so this is the plan we got a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.680 
works out so this is the plan we got a
bunch<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.989> 1<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.140> 8<00:00:35.239> I'm<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> run<00:00:36.600> them

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
bunch of 1 by 8 I'm going to run them

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.510 
bunch of 1 by 8 I'm going to run them
through<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> planer<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> I'm<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.190> plane

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
through the planer and I'm gonna plane

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
through the planer and I'm gonna plane
them<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.450> 5/8<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> an<00:00:40.320> eighth<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> then

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
them down to 5/8 of an eighth and then

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
them down to 5/8 of an eighth and then
we're<00:00:41.309> gonna<00:00:41.399> run<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> table<00:00:42.300> saw

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
we're gonna run them to the table saw

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.650 
we're gonna run them to the table saw
and<00:00:43.050> I'm<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> cut<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.879> 5/8

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and I'm going to cut them to one in 5/8

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.200 
and I'm going to cut them to one in 5/8
and<00:00:45.930> we'll<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.100> how<00:00:47.250> many<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.000> then

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and we'll see how many we get and then

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:15.950 
and we'll see how many we get and then
try<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> miss<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> knots

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.430 

once<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.340> trimmed<00:01:17.880> down<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:19.260> and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
once we have it trimmed down to one and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.460 
once we have it trimmed down to one and
five-eighths<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.210> five-eighths<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:22.200> we're

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
five-eighths and five-eighths then we're

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
five-eighths and five-eighths then we're
going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.800> put<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.160> cove<00:01:23.730> using<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.750> table<00:01:25.050> saw

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
going to put a cove using the table saw

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.680 
going to put a cove using the table saw
the<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.160> I'm<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.760> is<00:01:27.060> table

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
the way I'm going to do that is table

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.790 
the way I'm going to do that is table
saw<00:01:27.840> blade<00:01:28.550> table<00:01:29.550> saw<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.140> have<00:01:31.140> made<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.440> test

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
saw blade table saw I have made a test

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.190 
saw blade table saw I have made a test

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
mark on my table saw and on here I need

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.790 
mark on my table saw and on here I need
to<00:01:34.290> put<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> cross<00:01:35.310> pieces<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:36.440> twenty<00:01:37.440> point

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
to put the cross pieces at twenty point

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.910 
to put the cross pieces at twenty point
five<00:01:38.070> degrees<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.650> run<00:01:40.800> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
five degrees and then I will run the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:02:03.950 
five degrees and then I will run the
cove<00:01:41.160> on<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.930> pieces<00:01:43.410> of<00:01:43.560> trim

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.929 

once<00:02:04.960> I've<00:02:05.140> got<00:02:05.170> all<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.310> pieces<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.640> trim

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
once I've got all of the pieces of trim

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.440 
once I've got all of the pieces of trim
code<00:02:07.299> I'm<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:08.619> put<00:02:08.890> 45s<00:02:09.670> on<00:02:09.819> one<00:02:10.149> side

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
code I'm going to put 45s on one side

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.580 
code I'm going to put 45s on one side
I'm<00:02:11.410> gonna<00:02:11.739> do<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.160> at<00:02:13.150> obviously<00:02:13.690> 45

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I'm gonna do that at obviously 45

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.949 
I'm gonna do that at obviously 45
degrees<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.519> then<00:02:15.910> once<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.330> have<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.540> side

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
degrees and then once I have that side

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.280 
degrees and then once I have that side
cut<00:02:17.230> I'm<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.580> cut<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.970> side<00:02:19.239> at<00:02:19.629> 45

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
cut I'm going to cut this side at 45

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.110 
cut I'm going to cut this side at 45
degrees<00:02:20.650> then<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.310> gonna<00:02:21.430> flip<00:02:21.790> them<00:02:21.970> over

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
degrees then I'm gonna flip them over

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.500 
degrees then I'm gonna flip them over
and<00:02:22.480> I'm<00:02:22.930> gonna<00:02:23.110> put<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.380> 45<00:02:23.650> here<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:25.030> 45

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
and I'm gonna put a 45 here and a 45

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.420 
and I'm gonna put a 45 here and a 45
here<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.019> then<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.040> should<00:02:27.190> give<00:02:27.400> us

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
here and then that should give us

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:57.860 
here and then that should give us
something<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.290> looks<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.380> this

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.960 

something<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.830> note<00:02:59.010> when<00:02:59.250> you're<00:02:59.340> cutting<00:02:59.580> Co

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
molding on the miter saw is you don't

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
molding on the miter saw is you don't
need<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.060> bevel<00:03:03.420> your<00:03:03.569> miter<00:03:03.780> saw<00:03:04.080> just<00:03:04.530> angle

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
need to bevel your miter saw just angle

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.850 
need to bevel your miter saw just angle
it<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.970> natural<00:03:06.690> angle<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.650> the

trim<00:03:08.130> against<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.640> fence<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.000> what<00:03:09.150> gives<00:03:09.360> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
trim against the fence is what gives you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.589 
trim against the fence is what gives you
this<00:03:10.080> angle<00:03:10.560> for<00:03:11.099> doing<00:03:11.370> your<00:03:11.489> 45s<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
this angle for doing your 45s in the

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.780 
this angle for doing your 45s in the
Koch<00:03:12.810> molding<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.800> make<00:03:14.250> sure<00:03:14.280> you've<00:03:14.610> got<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
Koch molding so make sure you've got the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.059 
Koch molding so make sure you've got the
angle<00:03:15.239> right<00:03:15.269> against<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.170> base<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.890> saw

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
angle right against the base of the saw

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.640 
angle right against the base of the saw
index<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:18.269> against<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> fence<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.140> make

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
index it up against the fence and make

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:40.309 
index it up against the fence and make
your<00:03:19.830> cut

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.690 

you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.690 

so<00:03:47.180> there<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.810> can<00:03:47.960> see<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.770> trim<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.340> it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
so there you can see the the trim and it

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.160 
so there you can see the the trim and it
came<00:03:49.819> out<00:03:49.940> pretty<00:03:50.060> good<00:03:50.180> I'm<00:03:50.540> pretty<00:03:50.870> sure

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
came out pretty good I'm pretty sure

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.590 
came out pretty good I'm pretty sure
that<00:03:51.350> we<00:03:51.470> will<00:03:51.680> probably<00:03:51.890> never<00:03:52.550> buy<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:53.240> piece

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
that we will probably never buy a piece

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.320 
that we will probably never buy a piece
of<00:03:53.720> trim<00:03:53.900> from<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.140> box<00:03:54.410> store<00:03:54.709> ever<00:03:55.550> some<00:03:56.270> of

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
of trim from the box store ever some of

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.000 
of trim from the box store ever some of
you<00:03:56.390> might<00:03:56.569> asked<00:03:56.900> if<00:03:57.020> it's<00:03:57.170> worth<00:03:57.470> for<00:03:57.920> the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
you might asked if it's worth for the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.680 
you might asked if it's worth for the
amount<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.370> time<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.640> we<00:03:59.030> spent<00:03:59.330> making<00:03:59.480> it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
amount of time that we spent making it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.270 
amount of time that we spent making it
but<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.900> took<00:04:00.020> me<00:04:00.200> about<00:04:00.350> two<00:04:00.620> hours<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:01.130> make

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
but it took me about two hours to make

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.230 
but it took me about two hours to make
the<00:04:02.120> 70<00:04:02.900> or<00:04:02.930> 80<00:04:03.200> feet<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.530> trim<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.310> did<00:04:04.520> so

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
the 70 or 80 feet of trim that we did so

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.090 
the 70 or 80 feet of trim that we did so
in<00:04:05.600> our<00:04:05.690> book<00:04:05.930> that's<00:04:06.320> pretty<00:04:06.590> much<00:04:06.740> worth<00:04:06.920> it

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
in our book that's pretty much worth it

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.770 
in our book that's pretty much worth it
