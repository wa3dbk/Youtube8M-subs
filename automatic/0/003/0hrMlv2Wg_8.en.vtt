because shouldn't they be testing all
different<00:01:06.370> types<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.790> memories<00:01:07.120> on<00:01:07.150> on<00:01:07.540> their

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
different types of memories on on their

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.440 
different types of memories on on their
systems<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:08.980> they<00:01:09.460> know<00:01:09.730> what's<00:01:10.090> going

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
systems just so they know what's going

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.280 
systems just so they know what's going
on<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.590> if<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.890> happens<00:01:12.430> okay<00:01:13.240> let<00:01:13.780> them<00:01:13.960> try

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
on so if that happens okay let them try

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.290 
on so if that happens okay let them try
to<00:01:14.320> own<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:14.860> maybe<00:01:15.730> they<00:01:15.940> made<00:01:16.120> a<00:01:16.150> mistake

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
to own it that maybe they made a mistake

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.139 
to own it that maybe they made a mistake
this<00:01:16.780> time<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:18.009> in<00:01:18.100> any<00:01:18.250> case<00:01:18.369> what<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:18.790> wanted

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
this time but in any case what I wanted

in the original review I was having

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.280 
in the original review I was having
memory<00:01:26.890> compatibility<00:01:27.729> issues<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.509> yes<00:01:29.020> that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
memory compatibility issues and yes that

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.929 
memory compatibility issues and yes that
was<00:01:29.439> across<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.009> board<00:01:30.250> with<00:01:30.460> every<00:01:30.670> board

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
was across the board with every board

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.819 
was across the board with every board
that<00:01:31.090> I've<00:01:31.210> tested<00:01:31.540> now<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:31.899> haven't<00:01:32.320> tested<00:01:32.530> a

that I've tested now I haven't tested a

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.490 
that I've tested now I haven't tested a
couple<00:01:33.060> manufacturers<00:01:34.060> boards<00:01:34.420> yet<00:01:34.600> which<00:01:35.290> I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
couple manufacturers boards yet which I

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.219 
couple manufacturers boards yet which I
here<00:01:35.920> might<00:01:36.640> have<00:01:37.000> better<00:01:37.240> compatibilities

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
here might have better compatibilities

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.620 
here might have better compatibilities
than<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.590> boards<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.100> had<00:01:39.430> well<00:01:40.390> what<00:01:40.600> I

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
than the boards that I had well what I

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.100 
than the boards that I had well what I
was<00:01:40.869> going<00:01:40.960> through<00:01:41.439> was<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.960> either

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
was going through was I was either

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.350 
was going through was I was either
having<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:44.500> set<00:01:44.799> manual<00:01:45.280> timings<00:01:45.759> or<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.090> was

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
having to set manual timings or I was

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.670 
having to set manual timings or I was
having<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:47.039> basically<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:49.619> try<00:01:50.619> different

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
things to get memory to work I would get

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.529 
things to get memory to work I would get
it<00:01:53.200> into<00:01:53.320> Windows<00:01:53.829> it<00:01:54.039> would<00:01:54.159> crash<00:01:54.430> on<00:01:54.729> now

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
2667 there is no setting for 2133 so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.030 
2667 there is no setting for 2133 so
when<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> put<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.170> my<00:03:17.319> system<00:03:17.769> what<00:03:18.010> happens

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
when I put it in my system what happens

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.910 
when I put it in my system what happens
is<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.880> memory<00:03:19.180> fails<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.690> initialize<00:03:20.260> or<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
is the memory fails to initialize or it

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.460 
is the memory fails to initialize or it
even<00:03:21.190> tells<00:03:21.430> me<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.450> there's<00:03:22.840> no<00:03:23.080> memory

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
even tells me that there's no memory

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.210 
even tells me that there's no memory
installed<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:25.000> reason<00:03:25.330> why<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.569> because

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
installed and the reason why is because

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.599 
installed and the reason why is because
the<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:28.209> coding<00:03:28.690> for<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.829> XMP<00:03:30.579> settings<00:03:31.090> for

the the coding for the XMP settings for

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.970 
the the coding for the XMP settings for
z170<00:03:33.609> is<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:34.150> little<00:03:34.540> bit<00:03:34.690> different<00:03:35.230> than<00:03:35.799> the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
z170 is a little bit different than the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.300 
z170 is a little bit different than the
x99<00:03:36.840> i've<00:03:37.840> also<00:03:38.079> found<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.709> there<00:03:38.980> are<00:03:39.010> very

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
x99 i've also found that there are very

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.670 
x99 i've also found that there are very
few<00:03:39.430> memory<00:03:40.090> modules<00:03:40.660> out<00:03:40.840> there<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.440> say

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
few memory modules out there that say

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.009 
few memory modules out there that say
that<00:03:41.859> they<00:03:41.980> are<00:03:42.100> compatible<00:03:42.549> with<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.209> z170

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
that they are compatible with the z170

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.440 
that they are compatible with the z170
chipset<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.769> even<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:45.609> they<00:03:45.760> said<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.299> they

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
chipset and even if they said that they

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.440 
chipset and even if they said that they
are<00:03:46.720> they<00:03:47.500> might<00:03:47.799> not<00:03:47.980> be<00:03:48.250> totally<00:03:48.489> compatible

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
are they might not be totally compatible

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.640 
are they might not be totally compatible
with<00:03:49.750> XMP<00:03:50.650> because<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.549> this<00:03:51.730> issue<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.440> what

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
with XMP because of this issue so what

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.400 
with XMP because of this issue so what
you're<00:03:53.799> gonna<00:03:53.889> need<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.400> do<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.609> if<00:03:55.410> you're

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
you're gonna need to do is if you're

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.559 
you're gonna need to do is if you're

have<00:06:23.860> a<00:06:23.890> J<00:06:24.220> deck<00:06:24.430> of<00:06:25.170> 2133<00:06:26.170> you<00:06:26.920> could<00:06:27.070> probably

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
have a J deck of 2133 you could probably

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.310 
have a J deck of 2133 you could probably
get<00:06:27.610> into<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:27.970> BIOS<00:06:28.270> now<00:06:28.540> the<00:06:28.600> other<00:06:28.810> thing<00:06:29.080> is

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
get into the BIOS now the other thing is

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.140 
get into the BIOS now the other thing is
is<00:06:29.560> make<00:06:30.220> sure<00:06:30.250> when<00:06:30.670> you<00:06:30.790> get<00:06:30.970> your

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
is make sure when you get your

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.660 
is make sure when you get your
motherboards<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:31.990> flash<00:06:32.380> your<00:06:32.410> BIOS<00:06:33.190> before

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
motherboards you flash your BIOS before

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.360 
motherboards you flash your BIOS before
you<00:06:33.880> do<00:06:34.090> anything<00:06:34.930> if<00:06:35.890> you<00:06:36.130> have<00:06:36.160> a

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
you do anything if you have a

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.820 
you do anything if you have a
motherboard<00:06:36.880> that<00:06:37.240> has<00:06:37.420> BIOS<00:06:37.900> flashback<00:06:38.620> I

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
motherboard that has BIOS flashback I

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.470 
motherboard that has BIOS flashback I
would<00:06:38.980> suggest<00:06:39.160> not<00:06:39.490> putting<00:06:39.940> the<00:06:40.060> memory<00:06:40.360> in

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
would suggest not putting the memory in

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.180 
would suggest not putting the memory in
there<00:06:40.660> not<00:06:40.870> putting<00:06:41.170> the<00:06:41.290> processor<00:06:41.860> in<00:06:42.010> there

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
there not putting the processor in there

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.930 
there not putting the processor in there
go<00:06:42.700> ahead<00:06:42.880> and<00:06:43.030> and<00:06:43.300> hook<00:06:43.660> up<00:06:43.810> your<00:06:43.960> 24<00:06:44.440> pin

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
go ahead and and hook up your 24 pin

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.830 
go ahead and and hook up your 24 pin
24-pin<00:06:45.940> connector

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
24-pin connector

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.560 
24-pin connector
use<00:06:47.050> usb<00:06:47.740> BIOS<00:06:48.070> flash<00:06:48.280> back<00:06:48.700> and<00:06:48.940> do<00:06:49.270> it<00:06:49.389> that

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
use usb BIOS flash back and do it that

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.260 
use usb BIOS flash back and do it that
way<00:06:49.630> then<00:06:50.350> put<00:06:50.740> your<00:06:50.860> processor<00:06:51.520> and<00:06:51.730> your

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
way then put your processor and your

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.840 
way then put your processor and your
memory<00:06:52.570> into<00:06:52.900> it<00:06:53.100> I'm<00:06:54.100> gonna<00:06:54.280> go<00:06:54.490> ahead<00:06:54.610> and

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
memory into it I'm gonna go ahead and

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.520 
memory into it I'm gonna go ahead and
