00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
putting videos up so I'm gonna try to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.939 
putting videos up so I'm gonna try to
change<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.730> with<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> tutorial<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.949> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
change that with a tutorial here I in

change that with a tutorial here I in
this<00:00:23.789> server<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:25.369> there's<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> restriction

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this server here there's a restriction

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.630 
this server here there's a restriction
on<00:00:27.150> lava<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> place<00:00:28.170> lava<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> will

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
on lava you can place lava but it will

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.620 
on lava you can place lava but it will
only<00:00:29.849> flow<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.689> smooth<00:00:31.199> stone<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.920> obsidian

this makes mmm cobblestone generator is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.790 
this makes mmm cobblestone generator is
difficult<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> design<00:00:39.800> but<00:00:42.290> I've<00:00:43.290> managed<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
difficult to design but I've managed to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.670 
difficult to design but I've managed to
create<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.420> only<00:00:45.750> works<00:00:46.050> but

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
create one that not not only works but

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.750 
create one that not not only works but
is<00:00:47.420> incredibly<00:00:48.420> efficient<00:00:48.960> using<00:00:49.800> designs

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is incredibly efficient using designs

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.840 
is incredibly efficient using designs
that<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.239> seen<00:00:51.660> from<00:00:52.340> one<00:00:53.809> youtuber<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
that I've seen from one youtuber I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
that I've seen from one youtuber I
forgot<00:00:56.850> who<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.780> saw<00:00:58.050> him<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.350> reddit<00:00:58.829> he

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
forgot who it was I saw him on reddit he

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
forgot who it was I saw him on reddit he
was<00:00:59.100> given<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> tour<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.910> his<00:01:00.210> house<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.109> believe

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
was given a tour of his house I believe

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.729 
was given a tour of his house I believe
and<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.910> came<00:01:03.149> across<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.739> cobblestone

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and I came across this cobblestone

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.899 
and I came across this cobblestone
generator<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.600> two<00:01:07.189> source<00:01:08.189> blocks<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
generator with two source blocks on a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.490 
generator with two source blocks on a
single<00:01:10.700> lava<00:01:11.700> source<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
single lava source and you just and it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
single lava source and you just and it's
it<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:17.159> instantaneous<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.180> single<00:01:18.630> player<00:01:18.750> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it be instantaneous on single player but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
it be instantaneous on single player but
it's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.619> slower<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> lag

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it's a little slower because of the lag

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.499 
it's a little slower because of the lag
on<00:01:21.000> multiplayer<00:01:22.220> but<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.790> pretty<00:01:24.420> much

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
on multiplayer but you can pretty much

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.950 
on multiplayer but you can pretty much
just<00:01:24.810> stand<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:26.060> go<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> forth<00:01:29.840> for<00:01:30.840> as

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
just stand here go back and forth for as

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.730 
just stand here go back and forth for as
long<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:33.290> because<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.500> water

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
long as you want and because the water

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.270 
long as you want and because the water
is<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:36.630> block<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> doesn't<00:01:37.650> flow<00:01:37.920> down

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
is on one block and it doesn't flow down

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.050 
is on one block and it doesn't flow down
and<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.950> it'll<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.549> current<00:01:41.909> will

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and that way it'll the current will

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.730 
and that way it'll the current will
actually<00:01:42.420> carry<00:01:43.220> your<00:01:44.220> cobblestone<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
actually carry your cobblestone to you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
actually carry your cobblestone to you
however<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.159> any<00:01:47.820> does<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
however if any does get in there you can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.100 
however if any does get in there you can
walk<00:01:49.380> over<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.250> against<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.329> gap<00:01:52.079> here

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
walk over here up against this gap here

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
walk over here up against this gap here
and<00:01:52.890> collect<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:54.110> there's<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.170> spot<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and collect it there's a spot in here so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.289 
and collect it there's a spot in here so
you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.390> against<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
you can go up against it

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
you can go up against it
and<00:02:00.299> there's<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:00.929> over<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:05.119> there's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
and there's one over here so there's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
and there's one over here so there's
that<00:02:07.700> now<00:02:08.700> there's<00:02:09.229> there's<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.830> danger<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that now there's there's a danger to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.160 
that now there's there's a danger to
using<00:02:11.910> these<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.510> cobblestone

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
using these kind of cobblestone

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.750 
using these kind of cobblestone
generators<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.019> danger<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.760> easily

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
generators now the danger is easily

it's<00:03:54.720> not<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.290> best<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.950> considering<00:03:56.700> the

it's not the best but considering the

it's not the best but considering the

limitations on the server because we've

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.210 
limitations on the server because we've

that's made entirely out of wood or

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.650 
that's made entirely out of wood or
almost<00:04:04.709> entirely<00:04:05.160> majority<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.420> out<00:04:06.630> of

almost entirely majority of it is out of

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
wood and that wasn't fun to rebuild

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.230 
wood and that wasn't fun to rebuild
multiple<00:04:12.270> times<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:14.490> fire<00:04:14.730> making

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240
