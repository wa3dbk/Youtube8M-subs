the<00:01:11.220> problem<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.240> there's<00:01:12.689> no

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
the problem with this one is there's no

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.320 
the problem with this one is there's no
insulation<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> inside<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.090> thing

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
insulation on the inside of this thing

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.520 
insulation on the inside of this thing
so<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> acts<00:01:15.869> kind<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> funny<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:18.200> I've<00:01:19.200> used

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

this ever since then I keep getting
emails<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.000> people<00:01:24.150> saying<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.229> using

and<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.340> supposedly<00:02:56.640> builds<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> heat<00:02:57.989> not

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
and it supposedly builds up the heat not

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.199 
and it supposedly builds up the heat not
sure<00:02:59.010> how<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.130> works<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.880> guess<00:03:00.030> we'll

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
sure how that works but I guess we'll

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.479 
sure how that works but I guess we'll
find<00:03:00.239> out

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
find out

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.370 
find out
it<00:03:02.850> looks<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.360> way<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.660> goes<00:03:03.900> together

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.140 

is<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.769> ever<00:03:10.950> new<00:03:11.160> burner<00:03:11.459> goes<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.940> like<00:03:12.120> that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
is the ever new burner goes in like that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.340 
is the ever new burner goes in like that
and<00:03:13.850> this<00:03:16.640> somehow<00:03:17.640> or<00:03:18.000> another<00:03:18.030> am<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.079> doing

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and this somehow or another am I doing

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.930 
and this somehow or another am I doing
this<00:03:19.380> right

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.080 

yeah<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.810> goes<00:03:26.960> on<00:03:27.170> like<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.430> there<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.580> go

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.370 

so<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.240> three<00:03:34.450> pieces<00:03:34.690> are<00:03:34.960> like<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.350> you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
so the three pieces are like that you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.830 
so the three pieces are like that you
got<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.650> lower<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.190> upper<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.820> then<00:03:37.540> your

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
got to lower the upper and then your

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.750 
got to lower the upper and then your
burner<00:03:38.110> in<00:03:38.410> size<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:38.980> holding<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.460> up<00:03:39.580> off

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
burner in size it's holding it up off

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.300 
burner in size it's holding it up off
the<00:03:39.790> ground<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.720> can<00:03:40.900> see<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.200> there<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.770> then

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
the ground you can see it there and then

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.050 
the ground you can see it there and then
the<00:03:42.460> power<00:03:42.640> plate<00:03:44.430> let's<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.520> if<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.760> remember

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the power plate let's see if I remember

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.330 
the power plate let's see if I remember
the<00:03:46.150> instructions<00:03:46.750> just<00:03:46.890> yeah<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:47.950> goes<00:03:48.100> in

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
the instructions just yeah it goes in

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.430 
the instructions just yeah it goes in
like<00:03:48.520> that<00:03:48.550> and<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.480> heat<00:03:49.660> supposedly<00:03:50.200> comes

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
like that and the heat supposedly comes

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.430 
like that and the heat supposedly comes
up<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.740> hits<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:52.050> amplifies<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.290> heat

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
up and hits this and amplifies the heat

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.270 
up and hits this and amplifies the heat
somehow<00:03:53.790> we'll<00:03:54.790> find<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.860> other<00:03:57.010> thing

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
somehow we'll find out the other thing

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.190 
somehow we'll find out the other thing
that<00:03:57.310> they<00:03:57.550> say<00:03:57.760> with<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.390> when<00:03:59.050> you're

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
that they say with this is when you're

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.220 
that they say with this is when you're
lighting<00:03:59.500> it<00:04:00.030> never<00:04:01.030> try<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.570> hold<00:04:01.750> your<00:04:01.930> flame

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
lighting it never try to hold your flame

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.280 
lighting it never try to hold your flame
in<00:04:02.410> here<00:04:02.710> they<00:04:02.890> put<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.190> little<00:04:04.020> lighting<00:04:05.020> hole

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
in here they put a little lighting hole

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.560 
in here they put a little lighting hole
right<00:04:05.710> here<00:04:06.010> on<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.280> side<00:04:06.550> that<00:04:07.270> you<00:04:07.420> can

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
right here on the side that you can

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.410 
right here on the side that you can
supposedly<00:04:07.960> light<00:04:08.380> from<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:09.360> now<00:04:10.360> the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
supposedly light from there now the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.690 
supposedly light from there now the
other<00:04:10.690> thing<00:04:10.990> that<00:04:11.020> this<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.470> used<00:04:11.710> for<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:14.700> you

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
other thing that this is used for is you

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
other thing that this is used for is you
can<00:04:15.850> take<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.120> apart<00:04:16.450> take<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.959> burner<00:04:17.230> out

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
can take it apart take the burner out

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.180 
can take it apart take the burner out
put<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.900> power<00:04:20.230> plate<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:23.290> bottom<00:04:23.500> how<00:04:24.130> do

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
put the power plate on the bottom how do

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.740 
put the power plate on the bottom how do
you<00:04:24.340> do<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.670> oh<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.820> see<00:04:25.180> there's<00:04:25.390> slots<00:04:25.750> here

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
you do that oh I see there's slots here

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.140 
you do that oh I see there's slots here
put<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.900> Power<00:04:29.110> Plate<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:31.120> it's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
put the Power Plate in like so so it's

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.610 
put the Power Plate in like so so it's
on<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.570> lower<00:04:31.780> part<00:04:32.170> see<00:04:32.950> it<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.070> little<00:04:33.310> window

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
on the lower part see it a little window

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.420 
on the lower part see it a little window
put<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.770> back<00:04:36.010> on<00:04:36.280> top<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.990> now<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.380> use

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.580 

solid<00:04:42.430> fuel<00:04:42.570> like<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.600> speck<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.200> be<00:04:44.290> or<00:04:44.470> what

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
solid fuel like a speck to be or what

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.280 
solid fuel like a speck to be or what
not<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.910> could<00:04:46.060> also<00:04:46.210> just<00:04:46.390> use<00:04:46.720> wood

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
not and you could also just use wood

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.770 
not and you could also just use wood
small<00:04:47.800> pieces<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.610> wood<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.210> put<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.480> in<00:04:49.600> like

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
small pieces of wood and put it in like

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.140 
small pieces of wood and put it in like
so<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.290> this<00:04:50.919> supposedly<00:04:51.370> becomes<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.940> wood

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
so and this supposedly becomes a wood

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.460 
so and this supposedly becomes a wood
burner<00:04:54.390> now<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.450> ones<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.900> one<00:04:56.050> thing<00:04:56.230> that<00:04:56.440> I

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
burner now the ones the one thing that I

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.830 
burner now the ones the one thing that I
did<00:04:56.710> read<00:04:56.980> about<00:04:57.250> this<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.610> they<00:04:57.760> say<00:04:58.030> when

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
did read about this is they say when

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.500 
did read about this is they say when
you're<00:04:58.990> carrying<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.880> put<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.150> something

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
you're carrying this put it in something

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.960 
you're carrying this put it in something
wrap<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.260> in<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.470> cloth<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.010> put<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.820> inside

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
wrap it in a cloth and put it inside

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.800 
wrap it in a cloth and put it inside
something<00:05:04.419> because<00:05:04.960> by<00:05:05.650> itself<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:07.330> kind

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
something because by itself it is kind

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.720 
something because by itself it is kind
of<00:05:07.900> flimsy<00:05:08.200> you<00:05:08.530> could<00:05:08.710> flatten<00:05:09.160> this<00:05:09.400> i<00:05:09.550> guess

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
of flimsy you could flatten this i guess

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.170 
of flimsy you could flatten this i guess
real<00:05:10.090> easy<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:12.430> it's<00:05:12.640> all<00:05:12.790> made<00:05:12.970> out<00:05:13.000> of

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
real easy but it's all made out of

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.720 
real easy but it's all made out of
titanium<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.860> should<00:05:15.070> be<00:05:15.220> very<00:05:15.370> heat

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
titanium so it should be very heat

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.960 
titanium so it should be very heat
resistant<00:05:16.380> but<00:05:17.380> as<00:05:17.500> far<00:05:17.740> as<00:05:17.970> squashing

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
resistant but as far as squashing

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.770 
resistant but as far as squashing
resistance<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.840> just<00:05:20.110> isn't<00:05:20.290> there<00:05:21.780> and

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
resistance that just isn't there and

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.950 
resistance that just isn't there and
again<00:05:23.350> this<00:05:23.560> goes<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:28.060> goes<00:05:28.300> in<00:05:28.480> like<00:05:28.690> so

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
again this goes that goes in like so

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.760 
again this goes that goes in like so
this<00:05:29.950> goes<00:05:30.220> on<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.430> top<00:05:30.790> I<00:05:31.500> guess<00:05:32.500> in<00:05:32.680> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
this goes on the top I guess in the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.050 
this goes on the top I guess in the
summer<00:05:33.040> and<00:05:33.190> stuff<00:05:33.370> you<00:05:33.490> don't<00:05:33.669> really<00:05:33.790> need

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
summer and stuff you don't really need

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.580 
summer and stuff you don't really need
to<00:05:34.120> do<00:05:34.360> this<00:05:34.540> but<00:05:34.750> if<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:35.050> want<00:05:35.260> it<00:05:35.350> you<00:05:35.440> can

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
to do this but if you want it you can

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.440 
to do this but if you want it you can
put<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:35.830> in<00:05:35.919> like<00:05:36.100> so<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.550> then<00:05:37.060> your<00:05:37.210> pot

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
put it in like so and then your pot

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.240 
put it in like so and then your pot
comes<00:05:37.840> on<00:05:37.990> top<00:05:38.200> of<00:05:38.410> this<00:05:39.210> so<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:40.479> is<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:41.250> ever

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250

when<00:05:48.010> you're<00:05:48.160> done<00:05:48.400> with<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.670> let's<00:05:49.600> see<00:05:49.780> if<00:05:49.870> I

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
when you're done with it let's see if I

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.260 
when you're done with it let's see if I
can<00:05:50.140> do<00:05:50.320> this<00:05:53.520> goes<00:05:54.520> in<00:05:54.760> together<00:05:54.880> like<00:05:55.300> that

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270

with<00:06:03.490> the<00:06:03.580> power<00:06:03.760> plate<00:06:04.150> I<00:06:04.420> thought<00:06:05.050> that

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
with the power plate I thought that

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.110 
with the power plate I thought that
