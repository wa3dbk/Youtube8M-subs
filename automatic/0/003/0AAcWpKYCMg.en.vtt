00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello guys welcome back to new blog but 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.550
 that blog but blog and you guys today 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.469
 teaches one thing about networks already 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.860
 begins a myth thanks a lot 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.920
 how would i do without you guys then 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.220
 activate how to activate activation 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.390
 the parallels desktop service 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 version 8 ie the latest version that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 exits costs 1000 thousand euros 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.660
 there is a way we say not to activate them 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.859
 illegally everything is all legal that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.739
 what we do is all completely 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.780
 legal 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.340
 it is simply an extension 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.120
 we can make an extension 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.559
 of the trial version 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.350
 we simply don't do them for 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.789
 to show let us start the the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.050
 text see 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.660
 here it is if we start 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.399
 speak the same that the version is over 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 proof that I took advantage of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.899
 trial version for 14 days work 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 It just arrived the day zero and I 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.430
 I ask in segments to buy it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.689
 rightly however I found a bug 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 I found a bug boarding a bug that I was 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.430
 allows you to always have it to try again is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 a very interesting thing 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.670
 I'll show you the version logically 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.900
 version 8.0 version point 8 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.299
 sorry 8.0 point 18 35 December 4 in 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.729
 2012 bar bla bla who cares anyway 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 paralles 8 0 days remaining 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.350
 the only way to activate is to buy or 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 change what code and I have to buy 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.329
 in short, a code that I don't want 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.399
 buy but I want to continue giving 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.680
 improper that 14 days are not 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.119
 enough what we do for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 continue going on the trial we have 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 simply in our library 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 but he had this is the hard drive 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.079
 mother let's call the hard drive 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.960
 where we have the system a party of 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.960
 also installed the program 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.189
 parallel we go to the library 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.189
 after which we go inside 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.160
 preferences we delete preferences e 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.130
 let's right click sic click 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.050
 secondary guys if not on mike and what 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.270
 we do we eliminate there is not 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.940
 it eliminates because because already 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.670
 keyboard delete press command command 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.220
 delete delete of perfect book 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.990
 deleted and preferences is a cane 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.730
 sorry i'm wrong you don't have to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 eliminating preferences is one thing 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.750
 important 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.010
 it is necessary to eliminate within the preferences 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.450
 Parallel Parallel viewer 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.850
 delete will require the password 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.130
 logically it will be bla bla bla bla bla bla 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.510
 bla bla bla 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.210
 delete the folder now the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.240
 folder logically there is no longer see 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.280
 there is nothing left but to close 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.070
 on the contrary we also leave open 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.810
 leave our legendary parallel itself 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.390
 what happens that he tells us 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.460
 be careful the copy a registered you want 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.060
 go in trial period and there is a 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:16.850
 why no trials and now we invite 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:22.459
 a one my name a random email from 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:25.070
 mel trials and the current as in words 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:31.310
 now this other activates activated in 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:33.620
 way in the summer comes from a success 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.860
 done and finished with everyone happy everyone 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.170
 at home and if you use it, it looks the same every 14 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.320
 days I will be doing stuff is that if I do 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.090
 simply care if you guys don't 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.280
 would be dodgy giacomin would do 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.440
 save money every day forever 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.510
 living proof and trial periods is not 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.850
 legal guys is simply a 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.940
 extended trial period because why 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.440
 I don't know I want to go on trial 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.560
 always because I like the periods of 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.390
 test must say no no no no I'm not 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.850
 using legal inches I did not fuck 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.420
 code none simply for one 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.630
 try again 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.800
 15 to 14 days is enough hello girls 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.800
