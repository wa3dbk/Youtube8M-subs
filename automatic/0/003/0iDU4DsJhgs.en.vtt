00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.540 
strength to the skate going on to the
outsole<00:00:53.620> this<00:00:54.070> is<00:00:54.160> gonna<00:00:54.250> be<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.400> most

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
outsole this is gonna be the most

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.340 
outsole this is gonna be the most
affordable<00:00:54.850> skate<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.540> Bauer<00:00:55.750> Vapor<00:00:55.870> line

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
affordable skate in the Bauer Vapor line

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.680 
affordable skate in the Bauer Vapor line
that's<00:00:56.650> using<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.190> fiber<00:00:57.850> composite<00:00:58.540> outsole

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
that's using a fiber composite outsole

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.180 
that's using a fiber composite outsole
so<00:00:59.080> that's<00:00:59.200> going<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.350> offer<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.650> more<00:00:59.920> rigid

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
so that's going to offer a more rigid

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.650 
so that's going to offer a more rigid
fuel<00:01:00.610> as<00:01:00.790> well<00:01:00.970> as<00:01:01.060> being<00:01:01.180> very<00:01:01.270> lightweight

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
fuel as well as being very lightweight

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.300 
fuel as well as being very lightweight
so<00:01:02.140> it's<00:01:02.530> gonna<00:01:02.650> make<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.920> skate<00:01:03.130> more

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
so it's gonna make the skate more

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.039 
so it's gonna make the skate more
responsive<00:01:03.940> making<00:01:04.239> sure<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.600> any<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:04.960> the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
responsive making sure that any of the

in this material basically this is gonna
be<00:01:19.780> what<00:01:19.900> they're<00:01:19.990> calling<00:01:20.200> an<00:01:20.380> ultra<00:01:20.770> light

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
be what they're calling an ultra light

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.850 
be what they're calling an ultra light
tech<00:01:21.340> mesh<00:01:21.670> this<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> kind<00:01:23.650> of<00:01:23.710> has<00:01:23.830> a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
tech mesh this is a kind of has a

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.500 
tech mesh this is a kind of has a
fiberglass<00:01:24.430> like<00:01:24.640> feel<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:25.390> gone

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
fiberglass like feel to it so it's gone

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.060 
fiberglass like feel to it so it's gone
for<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.690> better<00:01:25.900> durability<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.620> as<00:01:26.980> I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
for a better durability and as I

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.649 
for a better durability and as I
mentioned<00:01:27.460> has<00:01:27.550> a<00:01:27.580> lot<00:01:27.790> more<00:01:27.940> support<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.540> the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
mentioned has a lot more support to the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.610 
mentioned has a lot more support to the
skate<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.140> gonna<00:01:29.230> make<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.500> more

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
skate so it's gonna make it more

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.380 
skate so it's gonna make it more
responsive<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.430> should<00:01:30.850> last<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.210> little<00:01:31.300> bit

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
responsive and should last a little bit

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.810 
responsive and should last a little bit
longer<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> back<00:01:33.280> side<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:33.580> can

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
longer going on to the back side you can

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090 
longer going on to the back side you can
see<00:01:33.850> those<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.960> same<00:01:35.200> rib<00:01:35.440> design<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.010> it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
see those that same rib design so it's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.680 
see those that same rib design so it's
still<00:01:36.250> gonna<00:01:36.340> have<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.580> same<00:01:36.850> overall<00:01:37.030> design

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
still gonna have the same overall design

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.630 
still gonna have the same overall design
as<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.530> rest<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.830> vapor<00:01:38.979> series<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:39.550> it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
as the rest of the vapor series so it's

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.580 
as the rest of the vapor series so it's
going<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.820> offer<00:01:39.880> great<00:01:40.030> stability<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.990> as<00:01:41.380> I

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
going to offer great stability and as I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.219 
going to offer great stability and as I
mentioned<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.220> has<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.610> great<00:01:43.390> responsive<00:01:44.020> feel

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
mentioned it has a great responsive feel

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.740 
mentioned it has a great responsive feel
as<00:01:44.380> well<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.970> back<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.420> front<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.659> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
as well going back to the front of the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.870 
as well going back to the front of the
skate<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.590> tongue<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.370> they<00:01:48.460> use<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.729> this

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
skate this tongue that they use on this

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.060 
skate this tongue that they use on this
is<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.150> little<00:01:49.750> bit<00:01:49.840> more<00:01:50.409> of<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.530> beefy<00:01:50.920> or<00:01:51.010> a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
is a little bit more of a beefy or a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.770 
is a little bit more of a beefy or a
thicker<00:01:51.460> tongue<00:01:51.790> than<00:01:51.970> what<00:01:52.120> you<00:01:52.240> saw<00:01:52.450> on<00:01:52.690> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
thicker tongue than what you saw on the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.660 
thicker tongue than what you saw on the
4<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.650> basically<00:01:53.860> we<00:01:54.010> have<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.220> lot<00:01:54.280> thicker

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
4 so basically we have a lot thicker

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.580 
4 so basically we have a lot thicker
foams<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.330> lace<00:01:55.570> bite<00:01:55.870> area<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.380> give<00:01:56.530> you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
foams in that lace bite area to give you

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.649 
foams in that lace bite area to give you
a<00:01:56.650> little<00:01:56.770> more<00:01:56.950> protection<00:01:57.580> against<00:01:58.510> lease

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
a little more protection against lease

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.780 
a little more protection against lease
by<00:01:58.870> as<00:01:59.020> well<00:01:59.560> as<00:01:59.619> maybe<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.010> stray<00:02:00.250> shot<00:02:00.520> or<00:02:00.729> a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
by as well as maybe a stray shot or a

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.789 
by as well as maybe a stray shot or a
slash<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.049> fairly<00:02:02.650> traditional

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
slash and this is a fairly traditional

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.410 
slash and this is a fairly traditional
tongue<00:02:03.340> still<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.000> gonna<00:02:04.090> be<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.240> white

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
tongue still so it's gonna be a white

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.240 
tongue still so it's gonna be a white
felt<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:05.470> can<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.740> there<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.010> stitched

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
right down the center so it's gonna wrap

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.699 
right down the center so it's gonna wrap
around<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:08.019> ankle<00:02:08.319> give<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> nice
