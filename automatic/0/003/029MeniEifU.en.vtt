minutes now to keep your extra red and
white<00:02:35.699> from<00:02:35.910> setting<00:02:36.419> I<00:02:36.600> place<00:02:37.320> mine

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
white from setting I place mine

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.400 
white from setting I place mine
the<00:02:38.000> sink<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.810> little<00:02:38.930> bit<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.230> hot

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
the sink with just a little bit of hot

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.320 
the sink with just a little bit of hot
water<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.100> make<00:02:40.280> sure<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.670> didn't<00:02:41.000> set<00:02:41.180> up

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330
