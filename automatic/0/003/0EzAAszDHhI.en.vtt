00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
not really sure where I'm at I'm just

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.589 
not really sure where I'm at I'm just
spreading<00:02:35.579> around<00:02:35.700> with<00:02:35.940> mp5<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.299> hadn't

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
spreading around with mp5 I hadn't

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.170 
spreading around with mp5 I hadn't
played<00:02:36.750> called<00:02:37.049> d<00:02:37.170> black<00:02:37.349> ops<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.829> past

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
played called d black ops in the past

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.910 
played called d black ops in the past
two<00:02:39.180> weeks<00:02:39.209> or<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.690> maybe<00:02:40.079> even<00:02:40.319> longer<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
two weeks or so maybe even longer and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.970 
two weeks or so maybe even longer and
the<00:02:41.760> reason<00:02:41.879> why<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.629> games<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.170> i

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the reason why is just the games I i

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.470 
the reason why is just the games I i
might<00:02:44.489> get<00:02:44.579> back<00:02:44.730> into<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.030> I'm<00:02:45.299> gonna

might get back into it I'm gonna

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.309 
might get back into it I'm gonna
probably<00:02:45.660> play<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.930> after<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.230> this

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
probably play it after I do this

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.830 
probably play it after I do this
