00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
fan base and i just figured i'd go ahead

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
fan base and i just figured i'd go ahead
and<00:00:26.939> talk<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.359> those<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.560> guess<00:00:28.769> we

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and talk about those but i guess we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.320 
and talk about those but i guess we
should<00:00:29.070> talk<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> elephant<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.150> room

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
should talk about the elephant the room

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
should talk about the elephant the room

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
going to happen well to be honest I've

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
going to happen well to be honest I've
kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.790> lost<00:00:38.940> hope<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:40.649> not

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
kind of lost hope and all but that's not

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.319 
kind of lost hope and all but that's not
to<00:00:40.980> say<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.370> won't<00:00:41.610> happen<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.210> it's

to say that it won't happen but it's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.790 
to say that it won't happen but it's
just<00:00:42.510> very<00:00:42.690> unlikely<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> will<00:00:43.590> happen

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
just very unlikely that it will happen

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
just very unlikely that it will happen
at<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.250> point<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.120> guys<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.510> feel<00:00:45.750> free

at this point but you guys can feel free

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
at this point but you guys can feel free
to<00:00:46.110> continue<00:00:46.289> supporting<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.250> trying<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
to continue supporting it and trying to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
to continue supporting it and trying to
get<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> happen<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.480> back<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.410> hundred

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
get it to happen I back at one hundred

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
get it to happen I back at one hundred
percent<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.629> rather

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
percent that's just that I'm will rather

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
percent that's just that I'm will rather
pessimistic<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> don't<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.699> happening

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
pessimistic so I don't see it happening

been<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> lot<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> ideas<00:01:11.610> thrown<00:01:12.060> around<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
been a lot of ideas thrown around like I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
been a lot of ideas thrown around like I
said<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> cover<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.340> three

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
said and I'm going to cover the three

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
said and I'm going to cover the three
big<00:01:14.909> ones<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.420> I've<00:01:15.509> heard<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.439> do

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
big ones that I've heard and all them do

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.770 
big ones that I've heard and all them do
seem<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.189> good<00:01:17.460> ideas<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
seem like pretty good ideas now the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
seem like pretty good ideas now the
first<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> least

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
first one and to me this is the least

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
first one and to me this is the least
likely<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> happened<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.590> i'll<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.310> ahead<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
likely to happened but i'll go ahead and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
likely to happened but i'll go ahead and
talk<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> first<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:25.140> Young

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
talk about it first is that Young

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
talk about it first is that Young
Justice<00:01:25.560> season<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.430> should<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.790> put<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
Justice season three should be put on

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080 
Justice season three should be put on
toonami<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.979> completely<00:01:29.549> unlikely

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
toonami now it's not completely unlikely

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
toonami now it's not completely unlikely
but<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.750> less<00:01:30.960> likely<00:01:31.350> than<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> other

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but it's just less likely than the other

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.580 
but it's just less likely than the other
two<00:01:31.890> reasons<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> here's<00:01:32.820> why<00:01:33.200> when<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> put

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
two reasons and here's why when you put

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
two reasons and here's why when you put
something<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.130> young<00:01:35.640> justice<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.299> adult

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
something like young justice on adult

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
something like young justice on adult
swim<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.710> makes<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.250> less<00:01:38.549> marketable<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
swim it makes it less marketable to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
swim it makes it less marketable to
children<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.350> most<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> DC

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
children which is what most of the DC

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
children which is what most of the DC
cartoons<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.079> ages<00:01:43.770> mostly

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
cartoons are there for all ages mostly

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
cartoons are there for all ages mostly
trying<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> pertain<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> children<00:01:45.689> which<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
trying to pertain to children which is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.840 
trying to pertain to children which is
why<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.619> Teen<00:01:46.890> Titans<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> where

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
why they like Teen Titans go and where

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
why they like Teen Titans go and where
the<00:01:47.970> Batman<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.540> much<00:01:48.750> well<00:01:49.140> mainly<00:01:49.409> Teen

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the Batman so much well mainly Teen

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
the Batman so much well mainly Teen
Titan<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> very<00:01:51.360> very<00:01:51.630> kid

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
Titan go because it is very very kid

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
Titan go because it is very very kid
friendly<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.009> why<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.399> rerun<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
friendly and it is why they rerun it so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.850 
friendly and it is why they rerun it so
much<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.409> reason<00:01:55.439> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
much that and for some reason it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
much that and for some reason it's
insanely<00:01:56.219> popular<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:58.049> even<00:01:58.140> know

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
insanely popular right I don't even know

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
videos on but anyway it's not completely

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.420 
videos on but anyway it's not completely
unlikely<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> happen<00:02:10.739> though<00:02:11.039> because

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
unlikely for it to happen though because

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.480 
unlikely for it to happen though because
if<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> remember<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
if you remember the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.730 
if you remember the
booted<00:02:12.760> thundercats<00:02:13.270> cartoon<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:14.020> also<00:02:14.470> put

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
booted thundercats cartoon was also put

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.160 
booted thundercats cartoon was also put
on<00:02:14.980> adult<00:02:15.280> swim<00:02:15.430> now<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.330> course<00:02:16.540> nothing<00:02:17.080> has

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
on adult swim now of course nothing has

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110 
on adult swim now of course nothing has
happened<00:02:17.650> with<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.980> even<00:02:18.130> though<00:02:18.310> was<00:02:18.730> put<00:02:18.970> on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
happened with it even though was put on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.670 
happened with it even though was put on
there<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.110> fact<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.590> was

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
there but it's the fact that it was

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.800 
there but it's the fact that it was
still<00:02:20.920> put<00:02:21.070> on<00:02:21.190> there<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.580> good<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.630> it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
still put on there is good for it and it

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.840 
still put on there is good for it and it
could<00:02:23.020> happen<00:02:23.200> young<00:02:23.530> justice<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.580> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
could happen young justice it's just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.640 
could happen young justice it's just
rather<00:02:25.030> unlikely<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.750> me<00:02:25.930> because<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.350> I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
rather unlikely to me because like I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.380 
rather unlikely to me because like I
said<00:02:26.710> they<00:02:27.040> can't<00:02:27.280> market<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> children<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
said they can't market the children and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.080 
said they can't market the children and
that's<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.320> quote<00:02:29.560> unquote<00:02:29.740> reason<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.940> it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that's the quote unquote reason that it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.880 
that's the quote unquote reason that it
was<00:02:31.240> cancelled<00:02:31.690> because<00:02:31.840> they<00:02:32.290> didn't<00:02:32.590> sell

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
was cancelled because they didn't sell

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.430 
was cancelled because they didn't sell
enough<00:02:32.920> things<00:02:33.520> yeah<00:02:34.450> calling<00:02:34.930> BS<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.410> that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
enough things yeah calling BS on that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.220 
enough things yeah calling BS on that
one<00:02:35.740> but<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.080> reason

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
one but if that if that was the reason

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.660 
one but if that if that was the reason
why<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.590> canceled<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.100> then<00:02:39.310> why<00:02:39.460> do<00:02:39.520> they

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
why they canceled it then why do they

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.190 
why they canceled it then why do they
put<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.000> adult<00:02:40.300> swim<00:02:40.420> where<00:02:40.720> they<00:02:40.840> wouldn't

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
put it on adult swim where they wouldn't

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.650 
put it on adult swim where they wouldn't
get<00:02:41.590> any<00:02:41.890> toys<00:02:42.220> sold<00:02:42.610> or<00:02:42.940> any<00:02:43.120> comics<00:02:43.540> or

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
get any toys sold or any comics or

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.510 
get any toys sold or any comics or
whatever<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.680> wouldn't<00:02:45.130> make<00:02:45.160> as<00:02:45.340> much

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
whatever it just wouldn't make as much

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.890 
whatever it just wouldn't make as much
sense<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.880> me<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.360> course<00:02:46.510> they<00:02:46.720> could

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
sense to me now of course they could

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.810 
sense to me now of course they could
advertise<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.710> adult<00:02:48.040> swim<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.520> those<00:02:48.670> kind

saying I have not seen it I didn't even
know<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.860> were<00:03:02.980> toys<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.580> knew<00:03:03.970> that

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
know that there were toys I knew that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.550 
know that there were toys I knew that
they<00:03:04.210> were<00:03:04.270> comics<00:03:04.720> though<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.080> we<00:03:05.200> won't<00:03:05.440> get

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
they were comics though but we won't get

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.120 
they were comics though but we won't get
into<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.800> later<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.420> past<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.560> fact<00:03:08.710> that<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
into that later so past the fact that it

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.710 
into that later so past the fact that it
could<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.430> adult<00:03:09.850> swim<00:03:09.970> here<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.600> other

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
could go on adult swim here the other

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.470 
could go on adult swim here the other
two<00:03:10.960> reasons<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.920> second<00:03:12.310> being<00:03:12.490> that<00:03:13.150> there

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
two reasons the second being that there

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.200 
two reasons the second being that there
could<00:03:13.690> be<00:03:13.720> an<00:03:13.930> animated<00:03:14.530> movie<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:15.490> tie<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.940> and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
could be an animated movie to tie in and

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.210 
could be an animated movie to tie in and
finish<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.870> series<00:03:17.290> now<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.590> think<00:03:17.800> this

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
finish off the series now I think this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.520 
finish off the series now I think this
is<00:03:18.340> pretty<00:03:18.520> likely<00:03:18.850> why<00:03:19.630> because<00:03:20.230> let's<00:03:20.440> look

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
is pretty likely why because let's look

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.410 
is pretty likely why because let's look

and then I got a movie to finish the
entire<00:03:32.860> series<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:34.270> why<00:03:34.960> did<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:35.230> happen

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
entire series now why did this happen

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.140 
entire series now why did this happen
because<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:35.950> lot<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.190> people<00:03:36.280> loved<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.030> it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
because a lot of people loved it and it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.330 
because a lot of people loved it and it
was<00:03:37.270> very<00:03:37.450> popular<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:39.130> guessed

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
was very popular just like you guessed

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.820 
was very popular just like you guessed
it<00:03:39.550> young<00:03:40.000> justice<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:41.080> what's<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.350> say<00:03:41.620> that

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
it young justice so what's to say that

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.590 
it young justice so what's to say that
it<00:03:41.950> won't<00:03:42.160> happen<00:03:42.400> with<00:03:42.730> young<00:03:42.880> justice<00:03:43.330> I

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
it won't happen with young justice I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600 
it won't happen with young justice I
think<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.470> movie<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:44.950> very<00:03:45.310> likely

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
think that the movie is a very likely

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.130 
think that the movie is a very likely
possibility<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.690> think<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.020> a<00:03:47.110> great

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
possibility and I think it's a great

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.410 
possibility and I think it's a great
idea<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:48.340> could<00:03:48.490> be<00:03:48.610> about<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.940> invasion<00:03:49.180> of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
idea it could be about the invasion of

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.180 
idea it could be about the invasion of
dark<00:03:49.720> side<00:03:49.990> while<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:50.380> was<00:03:50.650> coming<00:03:51.010> back<00:03:51.130> from

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
dark side while I was coming back from

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.310 
dark side while I was coming back from
the<00:03:51.430> Speed<00:03:51.700> Force<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.360> Nightwing<00:03:52.840> coming<00:03:53.230> to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
the Speed Force and Nightwing coming to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.290 
the Speed Force and Nightwing coming to
realization<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.040> who<00:03:54.190> he<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.460> you<00:03:55.270> know

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
realization of who he is and you know

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.180 
realization of who he is and you know
other<00:03:55.660> plot<00:03:56.080> threads<00:03:56.380> but<00:03:56.830> those<00:03:57.010> are<00:03:57.160> just

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
other plot threads but those are just

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.730 
other plot threads but those are just
the<00:03:57.340> ones<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.730> think<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:58.090> mainly<00:03:58.300> focus<00:03:58.750> on<00:03:58.900> you

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
the ones I think it mainly focus on you

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
whatever else you want to do well yeah I

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.300 
whatever else you want to do well yeah I
think<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:05.020> movie<00:04:05.290> would<00:04:05.380> be<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.530> great<00:04:05.770> idea<00:04:05.800> and

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
think a movie would be a great idea and

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.030 
think a movie would be a great idea and
of<00:04:06.970> course<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.330> final<00:04:07.690> reason<00:04:07.900> which<00:04:08.290> or<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
of course the final reason which or the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.920 
of course the final reason which or the
final<00:04:09.400> thing<00:04:09.580> rather<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.510> thing<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.750> I

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
final thing rather and the thing that I

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.540 
final thing rather and the thing that I
think<00:04:11.020> is<00:04:11.230> going<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.560> happen<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.950> most<00:04:12.130> likely

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
think is going to happen the most likely

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.460 
think is going to happen the most likely
is<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:13.030> comic<00:04:13.510> book<00:04:13.690> series<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.260> there's

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
is a comic book series and there's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.680 
is a comic book series and there's
actually<00:04:14.620> been<00:04:14.890> talks<00:04:15.340> about<00:04:15.670> this<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.120> think

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
actually been talks about this I think

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.090 
actually been talks about this I think
at<00:04:16.840> some<00:04:17.020> point<00:04:17.080> they<00:04:17.410> even<00:04:17.620> said<00:04:17.799> there<00:04:17.980> might

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
at some point they even said there might

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.130 
at some point they even said there might
be<00:04:18.160> an<00:04:18.340> exclusive<00:04:18.910> digital<00:04:19.120> comic<00:04:19.690> for<00:04:19.870> season

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
be an exclusive digital comic for season

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.080 
be an exclusive digital comic for season
3<00:04:20.410> but<00:04:21.040> yeah<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.190> do<00:04:21.340> think<00:04:21.669> it's<00:04:21.820> very<00:04:21.970> likely

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
3 but yeah I do think it's very likely

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.730 
3 but yeah I do think it's very likely
like<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.780> said<00:04:22.990> Teen<00:04:23.229> Titans

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
like I said Teen Titans

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.320 
like I said Teen Titans
its<00:04:23.919> own<00:04:24.069> comic<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:24.669> a<00:04:24.699> movie<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.300> I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
its own comic and then a movie so I

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.120 
its own comic and then a movie so I
think<00:04:25.449> it's<00:04:25.690> very<00:04:25.870> likely<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.800> could<00:04:27.009> get

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
think it's very likely that it could get

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.980 
think it's very likely that it could get
a<00:04:27.190> comic<00:04:27.550> book<00:04:27.729> as<00:04:27.880> well<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.360> hey<00:04:28.660> there

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
a comic book as well and hey there

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.140 
a comic book as well and hey there
