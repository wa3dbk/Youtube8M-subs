patch<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.300> beauty<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.930> don't<00:00:19.470> need<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
patch the beauty is you don't need a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490 
patch the beauty is you don't need a
very<00:00:20.220> large<00:00:20.580> area<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.480> fact<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.230> theory

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
very large area in fact it's a theory

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
very large area in fact it's a theory
that<00:00:22.769> says<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.490> could<00:00:23.699> grow<00:00:23.910> enough

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that says you could grow enough

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
that says you could grow enough
vegetables<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:25.050> feed<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> family<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.369> on

the size of a dog now that's quite
amazing<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.060> key<00:00:30.300> thing<00:00:30.570> though<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> make

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
amazing the key thing though is to make

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
amazing the key thing though is to make
sure<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.399> plant<00:00:32.730> little<00:00:33.690> bits<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sure that you plant little bits at the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.080 
sure that you plant little bits at the
time<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.829> make<00:00:34.980> sure<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.399> success<00:00:35.850> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
plant the entire pack of seed and all

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.990 
plant the entire pack of seed and all
your<00:00:40.950> vegetables<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.460> show<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> same

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
your vegetables will show at the same

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.549 
your vegetables will show at the same
time<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.719> don't<00:00:42.840> know<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.410> with

today to make sure that it's able to
fruit<00:00:55.910> secondly<00:00:56.910> make<00:00:57.840> sure<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
fruit secondly make sure that it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.099 
fruit secondly make sure that it's
prepared<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.609> really<00:01:00.090> well<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.960> we've

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
prepared really really well now we've

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
prepared really really well now we've
done<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.379> already<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.250> area<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> we've

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
done that already in this area and we've

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.440 
done that already in this area and we've
created<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.650> pathway<00:01:05.220> where<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.240> can

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
created a bit of a pathway where we can

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
created a bit of a pathway where we can
walk<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.930> between<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> vegetables<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.159> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
walk in between the vegetables when we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.789 
walk in between the vegetables when we
pick<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.630> preparation<00:01:10.229> our<00:01:10.320> vegetable

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
pick it the preparation our vegetable

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
pick it the preparation our vegetable
garden<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.490> simple<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.030> started<00:01:12.450> off<00:01:12.600> by

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
garden was very simple we started off by

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
garden was very simple we started off by
breaking<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> soil<00:01:14.010> breaking<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
breaking up the soil breaking down the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
breaking up the soil breaking down the
clods<00:01:15.630> preparing<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> beautifully<00:01:17.009> fine<00:01:17.310> seed

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
clods preparing a beautifully fine seed

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
clods preparing a beautifully fine seed
bed<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.689> ready<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> plant<00:01:19.530> seed<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.009> well

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
bed really ready to plant seed as well

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.820 
bed really ready to plant seed as well
as<00:01:20.340> seedlings<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.479> worked<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.020> loads<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
as seedlings we then worked in loads of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
as seedlings we then worked in loads of
organic<00:01:23.280> material<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.180> make<00:01:24.330> sure<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.810> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
organic material to make sure that we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.249 
organic material to make sure that we
have<00:01:25.259> lots<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.310> room<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.000> microorganisms<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
have lots of room for microorganisms to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
have lots of room for microorganisms to
grow<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:29.640> course<00:01:29.700> fertilizing<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> hugely

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
grow of course fertilizing is hugely

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
grow of course fertilizing is hugely
important<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.920> added<00:01:32.100> super<00:01:32.579> phosphates

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
important so we added super phosphates

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
important so we added super phosphates
that<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.869> feed<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> root<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> plant<00:01:34.829> we

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that will feed the root of the plant we

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
that will feed the root of the plant we
use<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.360> 50<00:01:36.689> grams<00:01:37.229> per<00:01:37.619> square<00:01:37.920> meter<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
use about 50 grams per square meter and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.480 
use about 50 grams per square meter and
dig<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.450> well<00:01:39.659> 50<00:01:40.320> grams<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
dig that in well 50 grams is about a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.350 
dig that in well 50 grams is about a
palm<00:01:41.970> full<00:01:42.530> broadcast<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.399> metre<00:01:45.030> squared

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
palm full broadcast over a metre squared

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.319 
palm full broadcast over a metre squared
which<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.869> by<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.430> then<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.579> added<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.060> one

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
which is one by one then we added in one

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.840 
which is one by one then we added in one
dose<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.689> 3/4<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> fertiliser

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
dose to 3/4 which is a fertiliser

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.929 
dose to 3/4 which is a fertiliser
ideally<00:01:51.600> blended<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.770> give<00:01:53.070> vegetables<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
ideally blended to give vegetables and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.450 
ideally blended to give vegetables and
any<00:01:54.270> plant<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.869> planting<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.530> great<00:01:56.070> start
