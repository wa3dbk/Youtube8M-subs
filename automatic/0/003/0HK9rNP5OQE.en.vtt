00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
many years ago when I was a student one

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.400 
many years ago when I was a student one
of<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.359> things<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.629> impressed<00:00:07.049> me<00:00:07.140> most

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
of the things that impressed me most

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.820 
of the things that impressed me most
about<00:00:07.740> our<00:00:08.309> faculty<00:00:09.300> was<00:00:09.990> their<00:00:10.230> ability<00:00:10.679> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
about our faculty was their ability to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.640 
about our faculty was their ability to
take<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.639> biblical<00:00:12.179> text<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.780> relate<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
take the biblical text and relate it to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.279 
take the biblical text and relate it to
everyday<00:00:13.920> life<00:00:14.389> but<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.450> soon<00:00:15.719> learned<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.109> knew

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
everyday life but I soon learned I knew

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.380 
everyday life but I soon learned I knew
very<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.520> context<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
very little about the context of the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
very little about the context of the
Bible<00:00:18.800> one<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> things<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.279> controls

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.660 
Bible one of the things that controls
meaning<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.289> context<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> audience

helping one another along the way it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.580 
helping one another along the way it's
the<00:01:27.360> best<00:01:27.450> freshman<00:01:28.080> year<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.530> know

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the best freshman year that I know

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.090 
the best freshman year that I know
available<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:30.049> think<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> strongest<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.920> in

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
available I think the strongest point in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
available I think the strongest point in
this<00:01:32.250> entire<00:01:32.579> program<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.350> much<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this entire program is that much of the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
this entire program is that much of the
things<00:01:34.920> we'll<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> classroom<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:36.780> be

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
things we'll do in the classroom will be

things we'll do in the classroom will be
hands-on<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> artifacts<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
hands-on will have the artifacts to

hands-on will have the artifacts to
handle<00:01:39.509> we'll<00:01:39.930> look<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.259> things<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> lab

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
handle we'll look at things in the lab

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.730 
handle we'll look at things in the lab
will<00:01:41.820> make<00:01:42.329> things<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> work<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
will make things and work through the
