one<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> those<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:20.029> local<00:00:21.029> electronics<00:00:21.510> store

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
one of those a local electronics store

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
one of those a local electronics store
and<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.470> don't<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.920> works<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and I don't know if it works with the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.320 
and I don't know if it works with the
wireless<00:00:25.189> xbox360<00:00:26.189> controller<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> bet<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
wireless xbox360 controller but I bet it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.439 
wireless xbox360 controller but I bet it
probably<00:00:27.720> does<00:00:28.010> just<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
probably does just some way but this is

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.950 
probably does just some way but this is
the<00:00:30.630> easiest<00:00:30.900> way<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> um<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> want<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
wireless controller into the wired

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.340 
wireless controller into the wired
