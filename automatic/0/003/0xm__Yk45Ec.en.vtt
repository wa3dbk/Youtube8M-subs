well<00:03:03.069> three<00:03:03.340> line<00:03:03.489> potential<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.060> don't<00:03:04.209> really

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
well three line potential I don't really

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.330 
well three line potential I don't really
care<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.689> all<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.139> gotta<00:03:05.500> feel<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.829> dirt

really<00:04:19.889> this<00:04:20.889> is<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.159> really<00:04:21.519> i<00:04:21.549> don't<00:04:21.669> really

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
really this is it really i don't really

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.089 
really this is it really i don't really
have<00:04:22.090> any<00:04:22.240> attack<00:04:22.479> buffs<00:04:22.840> do<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.169> nope<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:24.039> don't

but<00:04:25.500> yeah<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.740> pretty<00:04:26.889> much<00:04:27.039> it<00:04:27.539> which<00:04:28.539> is

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
but yeah this is pretty much it which is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.830 
but yeah this is pretty much it which is
I<00:04:29.389> guess<00:04:29.720> pretty<00:04:29.960> decent<00:04:30.560> considering<00:04:31.840> my

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
I guess pretty decent considering my

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.559 
I guess pretty decent considering my
level<00:04:33.199> and<00:04:35.139> and<00:04:36.139> considering<00:04:36.889> my<00:04:37.240> class<00:04:38.240> which

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
level and and considering my class which

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.040 
level and and considering my class which
is<00:04:38.889> paladin<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:40.430> um<00:04:41.030> oh<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.569> also<00:04:41.780> goes<00:04:41.900> up

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
is paladin so um oh it also goes up

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.360 
is paladin so um oh it also goes up
because<00:04:42.139> i<00:04:42.259> have<00:04:42.409> defined<00:04:42.560> shield<00:04:43.009> so<00:04:43.250> now

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
because i have defined shield so now
