thing you're going to notice when you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
thing you're going to notice when you
receive<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.340> Hakata<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.270> you're<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
receive your Hakata is you're going to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.469 
receive your Hakata is you're going to
see<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.649> did<00:02:04.890> indeed<00:02:05.159> start<00:02:05.850> from<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.210> seed

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
see that it did indeed start from a seed

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.919 
see that it did indeed start from a seed
and<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.789> root<00:02:09.119> stock<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.780> root

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and that is just the root stock the root

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.920 
and that is just the root stock the root
stock<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.800> dwarf<00:02:11.610> root<00:02:11.940> stock<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.690> does

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
stock is a dwarf root stock that does

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.030 
stock is a dwarf root stock that does
not<00:02:13.200> produce

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
not produce

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.630 
not produce
edible<00:02:14.670> fruit<00:02:14.909> whatsoever<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:17.400> chose

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
edible fruit whatsoever and so we chose

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.759 
edible fruit whatsoever and so we chose
the<00:02:17.849> rootstock<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.480> keep<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.930> actual<00:02:19.319> tree

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
the rootstock to keep the actual tree

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.809 
the rootstock to keep the actual tree
from<00:02:20.310> staying

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
from staying

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.270 
from staying
from<00:02:21.209> getting<00:02:21.329> too<00:02:21.599> tall<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:22.799> if<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> come

talking about with the graft the graft
is<00:02:27.689> right<00:02:28.470> here<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:30.209> graft<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.409> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
is right here and this graft is going to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.009 
is right here and this graft is going to
ensure<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.819> beautiful<00:02:33.599> top<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
ensure that the beautiful top of the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.069 
ensure that the beautiful top of the
plant<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.560> stays<00:02:35.489> at<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.849> decent<00:02:36.390> height<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
plant here stays at a decent height and

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.220 
plant here stays at a decent height and
does<00:02:37.920> not<00:02:38.129> get<00:02:38.430> too<00:02:38.879> tall<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:40.140> will

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
does not get too tall and it will

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.140 
does not get too tall and it will
pervert<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.709> will<00:02:40.920> provide<00:02:41.190> fruit<00:02:41.579> because<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
pervert I will provide fruit because the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
pervert I will provide fruit because the
the<00:02:43.280> actual<00:02:44.280> graft<00:02:44.609> is<00:02:45.049> about<00:02:46.049> three<00:02:46.650> years

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the actual graft is about three years

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.490 
the actual graft is about three years
old<00:02:47.040> already<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.239> old<00:02:48.510> enough<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.840> fruit

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
old already so it's old enough to fruit

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
old already so it's old enough to fruit
because<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.459> old<00:02:50.640> enough<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.599> be<00:02:51.720> grafted<00:02:53.000> so

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
because it's old enough to be grafted so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.580 
because it's old enough to be grafted so
now<00:02:54.090> we're<00:02:54.239> going<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.510> talk<00:02:54.720> about<00:02:54.959> growing

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
now we're going to talk about growing

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.470 
now we're going to talk about growing
them<00:02:55.889> so<00:02:56.430> when<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.609> get<00:02:56.760> your<00:02:56.790> avocado<00:02:57.269> you're

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
them so when you get your avocado you're

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.030 
them so when you get your avocado you're
going<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.750> want<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> repot<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.590> when<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
going to want to repot it and when you

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.649 
going to want to repot it and when you
repot<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.430> you're<00:02:59.849> going<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> probably<00:03:00.359> want

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
repot it you're going to probably want

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.839 
repot it you're going to probably want
to<00:03:00.690> put<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.170> one<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.409> two<00:03:01.709> gallon<00:03:02.280> pot<00:03:02.579> to

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
to put it in a one to two gallon pot to

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.819 
to put it in a one to two gallon pot to
start<00:03:03.150> off<00:03:03.299> with<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.780> doesn't<00:03:03.900> need<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.200> big

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
start off with it doesn't need that big

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.619 
start off with it doesn't need that big
of<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> pot<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.459> begin<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.909> just<00:03:05.940> because<00:03:06.389> of

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
of a pot to begin with just because of

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.729 
of a pot to begin with just because of
the<00:03:06.690> fact<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.109> roots<00:03:07.290> aren't<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
the fact that the roots aren't that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.240 
the fact that the roots aren't that
mature<00:03:08.129> yet<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.629> chances<00:03:09.629> are<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.920> will<00:03:11.069> be

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
mature yet and chances are it will be

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.479 
mature yet and chances are it will be
fine<00:03:11.519> for<00:03:11.549> about<00:03:12.409> two<00:03:13.409> or<00:03:13.560> three<00:03:13.620> years<00:03:14.190> in

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
fine for about two or three years in

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.910 
fine for about two or three years in
that<00:03:14.790> two<00:03:15.030> gallon<00:03:15.420> pot<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.530> don't<00:03:16.709> need<00:03:16.829> to

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
that two gallon pot so you don't need to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.189 
that two gallon pot so you don't need to
worry<00:03:17.129> when<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> comes<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.970> also<00:03:18.599> when<00:03:19.109> it

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
worry when it comes to that also when it

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.809 
worry when it comes to that also when it

me it's not it's not very compost rich
stuff<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.909> water<00:03:57.180> does<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:57.510> really<00:03:58.019> set

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
stuff so the water does not really set

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.229 
stuff so the water does not really set
in<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.889> soil<00:03:59.220> very<00:03:59.310> long<00:03:59.760> and<00:03:59.940> that's<00:04:00.060> what

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
in the soil very long and that's what

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.819 
in the soil very long and that's what
avocados<00:04:00.720> are<00:04:00.870> used<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.379> you're<00:04:01.530> going<00:04:01.739> to

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
avocados are used to so you're going to

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.979 
avocados are used to so you're going to
want<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.010> give<00:04:02.159> them<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.609> cactus<00:04:03.540> mix<00:04:03.780> and

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
want to give them a cactus mix and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.559 
want to give them a cactus mix and
that's<00:04:04.109> what<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.409> actually<00:04:05.280> recommend<00:04:05.970> for

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
that's what we actually recommend for

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.740 
that's what we actually recommend for
our<00:04:07.010> not<00:04:08.010> only<00:04:08.220> our<00:04:08.340> avocados<00:04:09.060> about<00:04:09.629> our

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
our not only our avocados about our

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.379 
our not only our avocados about our
citrus<00:04:10.169> is<00:04:10.319> as<00:04:10.440> well<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:11.669> your<00:04:11.970> basic

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
citrus is as well so just your basic

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.680 
citrus is as well so just your basic
cactus<00:04:13.019> mix<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.440> going<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.769> be<00:04:13.859> just<00:04:14.159> fine<00:04:14.690> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
cactus mix is going to be just fine and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.000 
cactus mix is going to be just fine and
that<00:04:15.840> will<00:04:16.019> ensure<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.409> have<00:04:16.470> good<00:04:16.739> drainage

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
that will ensure you have good drainage

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.520 
that will ensure you have good drainage
but<00:04:17.750> make<00:04:18.750> sure<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:19.019> do<00:04:19.169> water<00:04:19.440> them

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
but make sure you do water them

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.379 
but make sure you do water them
frequently<00:04:20.070> because<00:04:20.549> they<00:04:20.729> they<00:04:21.150> can

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
frequently because they they can

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.930 
frequently because they they can
tolerate<00:04:21.599> it<00:04:21.900> they<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.109> enjoy<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.940> also

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
tolerate it they do enjoy it also

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.700

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.840 
is a is a dwarf root stock but the
actual<00:05:44.450> growing<00:05:44.840> plant<00:05:45.590> here<00:05:45.890> is<00:05:46.160> about<00:05:46.640> 3

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
actual growing plant here is about 3

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.310 
actual growing plant here is about 3
years<00:05:46.940> old<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.450> comes<00:05:47.600> from<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.900> mature

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
years old and it comes from a mature

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.940 
years old and it comes from a mature
tree<00:05:48.650> so<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.630> plant<00:05:50.960> itself<00:05:51.380> doesn't

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
tree so the the plant itself doesn't

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.880 
tree so the the plant itself doesn't
know<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.990> roots<00:05:54.560> are<00:05:54.740> not

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
know that it that the roots are not

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.710 
know that it that the roots are not
mature<00:05:55.160> enough<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.700> sustain<00:05:55.910> all<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.479> fruit

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
mature enough to sustain all that fruit

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.610 
mature enough to sustain all that fruit
so<00:05:56.870> it'll<00:05:57.050> try<00:05:57.289> to<00:05:57.320> fruit<00:05:57.740> 5<00:05:58.520> 10<00:05:59.150> avocados<00:06:00.020> but

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
so it'll try to fruit 5 10 avocados but

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.710 
so it'll try to fruit 5 10 avocados but
make<00:06:01.100> sure<00:06:01.130> not<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.460> grow<00:06:01.729> that<00:06:01.910> many<00:06:02.150> because

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
make sure not to grow that many because

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.420 
make sure not to grow that many because
it'll<00:06:02.930> kill<00:06:03.110> itself<00:06:03.410> so<00:06:03.800> you<00:06:03.860> just<00:06:04.190> want<00:06:04.370> to

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
it'll kill itself so you just want to

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.190 
it'll kill itself so you just want to
keep<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.669> to<00:06:04.789> about<00:06:04.880> one<00:06:05.090> or<00:06:05.210> two<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:05.930> first

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
keep it to about one or two that first

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.290 
keep it to about one or two that first
year<00:06:06.500> then<00:06:07.070> maybe<00:06:07.310> about<00:06:07.460> five<00:06:07.760> or<00:06:07.940> six<00:06:08.180> a

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
year then maybe about five or six a

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.090 
year then maybe about five or six a
second<00:06:08.600> year<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:08.900> then<00:06:09.320> after<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.860> about<00:06:09.979> the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
second year and then after the about the

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.340 
second year and then after the about the
third<00:06:10.460> year<00:06:10.729> you<00:06:10.940> can<00:06:11.270> let<00:06:11.419> it<00:06:11.539> just<00:06:12.020> go

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
third year you can let it just go
