00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.649
 What happens on Earth when a giant meteor of 400 km in diameter collides 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:25.369
 Beneath a simulation on the basis of the supervision of scientists who specialize in geophysics 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:28.179
 It is said that there was a collision on the present earth to make it easy to understand the size of the meteorites and the impact of the collision 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.179
 I assumed 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.840
 400 km and Montignac 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.840
 The size exceeds the width of Honshu 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.070
 me 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:57.240
 The fall location was in the Pacific Ocean 1500 km south of Japan 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:03.890
 The speed of meteorites is 72,000 places per hour 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.890
 But because the meteorites are so huge they look creepy and slow 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.930

 Now, nearly 10 kilometers will be rolled up entirely 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.480
 It is called a tsunami near by 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.659
 It looks like it is used as if it was 4000m deep that was stuck to the tsunami nearby 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.319
 Huge fragments of the city ​​exposition 1 km rise up the town 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:01.220
 The Japanese archipelago will also be on the rise

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:14.110
 The shredded fragments are several thousand kilometers high 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.110
 It drenched the earth's surface again become a meteorite after the other until the space to penetrate the atmosphere

 The edge of the beautiful ー is 6 meters in height 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.550
 It looks like a huge mountain range 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 The diameter of the crater is 4000 k 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.370
 Swallow from Uwa Muto to a part of mainland China

 [musics] 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:57.430
 Immediately after the impact of meteorites 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.430
 When it sees from space, the leading role of the inn appears in the center of the crater's ring 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.270

 It is better to have a huge glowing glowing color 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:12.160
 This is the bullet specific rock epithelium became subject

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:45.810
 It is about 3 hours if it falls to the south meeting place of Japan if it is assumed on the present earth 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.810
 The situation of remaining seats will be in the Himalayas 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:55.559
 Temperature 4000 degree nets run through at 300 meters per minute

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:11.350
 The medium snow covered in the rock melts instantly to make a face and evaporates soon

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.029
 The rock above hits the back of the collision store 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:26.340
 It also reaches amazon

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:35.770
 Because of the high fever, the ignites will fire spontaneously one after another 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.770
 The jungle will instantly turn into a sea of ​​fire 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:52.000
 One day after the collision , the earth seems to be completely covered with scorching rocks.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.690
 The rock wins the whole uterus and continues for nearly a year 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:08.100
 It is the same as the countless correspondence appeared

 I started to boil 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:48.689
 The sea ​​surface will simmer for 1 minute at a horizontal speed of centigrade by intense evaporation 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.480
 A white revision appears when the seawater dries up 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.850
 Specification is 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.850
 The salt also evaporates quickly 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:11.090
 Exposed revision is exposed to heat without mercy 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.090

 Collision of a giant meteorite with a diameter of 400 km 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:09.579
 It is a horrible event that will end the creature
