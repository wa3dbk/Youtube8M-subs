about foods that can absolutely immune

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
about foods that can absolutely immune
system<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.210> need<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:57.570> about<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
system so we need to think about this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.599 
system so we need to think about this
and<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.379> need<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> cook<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.430> much

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and we need to cook with these as much

and we need to cook with these as much
as<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
as we can right now right so as you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.569 
as we can right now right so as you
heard<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.649> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> focus<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> things<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
heard we want to focus on the things to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
heard we want to focus on the things to
add<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.390> also<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> things<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> stay<00:01:04.229> away

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
add in but also the things to stay away

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
add in but also the things to stay away
from<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.070> some<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> those<00:01:05.430> processed

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
from and so some of those processed

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
from and so some of those processed
foods<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> harvest<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
foods can actually kind of harvest the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
foods can actually kind of harvest the
bad<00:01:08.100> bacteria<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.060> exacerbate<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
bad bacteria that can exacerbate the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
bad bacteria that can exacerbate the
colds<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.530> flu<00:01:10.680> symptoms<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.520> we're<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
colds or flu symptoms but we're going to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.130 
colds or flu symptoms but we're going to
talk<00:01:11.970> today<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> foods<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
talk today about the foods we want to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
talk today about the foods we want to
include<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.650> help<00:01:13.860> boost<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.280> our<00:01:14.400> immune

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
include to help boost up our immune

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.800 
include to help boost up our immune
system<00:01:15.000> I'll<00:01:15.119> right<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.720> even

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
system I'll right so what do you even

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
system I'll right so what do you even
start<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> first<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.770> garlic

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
start with well the first one is garlic

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.880 
start with well the first one is garlic
so<00:01:17.729> garlic<00:01:18.150> has<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> compound<00:01:18.900> called<00:01:19.200> allicin

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so garlic has a compound called allicin

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.940 
so garlic has a compound called allicin
and<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.759> antiviral<00:01:21.600> antibacterial<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and it's antiviral antibacterial and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.190 
and it's antiviral antibacterial and
actually<00:01:23.189> anti-parasitic<00:01:23.939> very<00:01:24.689> powerful

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually anti-parasitic very powerful

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
actually anti-parasitic very powerful
fighter<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> system<00:01:26.159> helps<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> boost<00:01:26.729> our

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
fighter in the system helps to boost our

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.210 
fighter in the system helps to boost our
white<00:01:27.150> blood<00:01:27.299> cell<00:01:27.630> production<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.680> fights

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
white blood cell production which fights

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
white blood cell production which fights
off<00:01:29.400> foreign<00:01:29.700> invaders<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.409> use

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
off foreign invaders so we can use

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
off foreign invaders so we can use
garlic<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> almost<00:01:32.340> every<00:01:32.790> recipe<00:01:33.090> starts

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
garlic and almost every recipe starts

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
garlic and almost every recipe starts
with<00:01:33.630> saute<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> garlic<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
with saute a little bit of garlic so I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
with saute a little bit of garlic so I
recommend<00:01:36.390> bumping<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
recommend bumping it up a little bit and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.319 
recommend bumping it up a little bit and
what<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> recommend<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.310> also<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> roasting

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
what I recommend doing also is roasting

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
what I recommend doing also is roasting
a<00:01:39.420> head<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> garlic<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a head of garlic so what I do here is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
a head of garlic so what I do here is
you're<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.820> gonna<00:01:42.060> cross<00:01:42.390> section<00:01:42.930> cut<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you're just gonna cross section cut on

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
you're just gonna cross section cut on
the<00:01:43.890> top<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> bulb<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.540> never<00:01:45.780> done

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the top of the bulb I have never done

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
the top of the bulb I have never done
this<00:01:46.170> before<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.649> you're<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.100> dispose

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
this before so you're just gonna dispose

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.660 
this before so you're just gonna dispose
each<00:01:48.350> clove<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.159> you'll<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
each clove and then you'll just take a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.719 
each clove and then you'll just take a
thin<00:01:50.790> slice<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.299> butter<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> use<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.729> pasture

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
thin slice of butter I use the pasture

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
thin slice of butter I use the pasture
Organic<00:01:54.600> Valley<00:01:54.869> butter<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.649> more<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
Organic Valley butter so it has more of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.459 
Organic Valley butter so it has more of
the<00:01:56.130> omega-3<00:01:56.820> fatty<00:01:57.090> acids<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.320> just

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the omega-3 fatty acids and I'm just

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.550 
the omega-3 fatty acids and I'm just
gonna<00:01:58.590> place<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.460> slice<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.119> top<00:02:00.560> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
gonna place this little slice on top and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.899 
gonna place this little slice on top and
then<00:02:01.680> sprinkle<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.250> bit<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.520> sea<00:02:02.880> salt

in foil like this and keep in mind the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.529 
in foil like this and keep in mind the
roots<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.220> still<00:02:08.250> intact<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.179> keeps<00:02:09.330> all

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
roots are still intact so that keeps all

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.809

those<00:03:05.769> three<00:03:06.010> will<00:03:06.220> help<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.489> boost<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
those three will help to boost the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.150 
those three will help to boost the
immune<00:03:06.850> system<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.540> also<00:03:07.930> vitamin<00:03:08.319> D<00:03:08.800> so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
immune system and also vitamin D so

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.800 
immune system and also vitamin D so
vitamin<00:03:09.519> d<00:03:09.790> we're<00:03:10.000> gonna<00:03:10.090> find<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.540> our<00:03:10.660> egg

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
vitamin d we're gonna find in our egg

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.170 
vitamin d we're gonna find in our egg
yolks<00:03:11.200> also<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.100> our<00:03:12.190> milk<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.640> fortified

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
yolks also in our milk and fortified

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.990 
yolks also in our milk and fortified
grains<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.769> having<00:03:15.190> hard<00:03:15.459> boiled<00:03:15.760> eggs

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
grains and so having hard boiled eggs

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.400 
grains and so having hard boiled eggs
and<00:03:16.180> your<00:03:16.330> kiddos<00:03:16.510> lunches<00:03:16.989> would<00:03:17.110> be<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> good

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and your kiddos lunches would be a good

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.539 
and your kiddos lunches would be a good
way<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.560> kind<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.829> boost<00:03:17.980> up<00:03:18.190> their<00:03:18.340> immune

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
way to kind of boost up their immune

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.250 
way to kind of boost up their immune
system<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.239> then<00:03:19.420> tea<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.780> always<00:03:20.049> good<00:03:20.230> to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
system and then tea is always good to

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.590 
system and then tea is always good to
tea<00:03:20.530> as<00:03:20.650> well<00:03:20.890> yes<00:03:21.310> actually<00:03:21.820> both<00:03:21.940> black<00:03:22.299> tea

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
tea as well yes actually both black tea

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.720 
tea as well yes actually both black tea
and<00:03:22.840> green<00:03:23.260> tea<00:03:23.410> are<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:23.980> potent<00:03:24.489> immune

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and green tea are very potent immune

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.850 
and green tea are very potent immune
boosters<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.600> my<00:03:25.959> last<00:03:26.200> one<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.440> really<00:03:26.620> want

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
boosters and my last one I really want

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.620 
boosters and my last one I really want
to<00:03:26.920> focus<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.549> going<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.820> be<00:03:27.940> chicken<00:03:28.299> soup

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
to focus on is going to be chicken soup

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.990 
to focus on is going to be chicken soup
we<00:03:29.590> heard<00:03:29.829> we<00:03:29.980> hear<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.310> that's<00:03:30.459> always<00:03:30.670> good

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
we heard we hear that that's always good

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.880 
we heard we hear that that's always good
for<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.239> common<00:03:31.660> cold<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.200> it's<00:03:32.380> really<00:03:32.650> quick

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.530 
for a common cold and it's really quick
to<00:03:33.070> make<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.220> simple<00:03:33.670> bone<00:03:33.820> broth<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.329> I'm<00:03:34.450> gonna

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
to make a simple bone broth so I'm gonna

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
to make a simple bone broth so I'm gonna
pop<00:03:34.750> over<00:03:35.019> here<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.410> show<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.620> how

pop over here and just show you how
quickly<00:03:36.489> we<00:03:36.640> can<00:03:36.790> throw<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> together<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:37.870> I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
quickly we can throw it together so I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.080 
quickly we can throw it together so I
have<00:03:37.989> some<00:03:38.320> water<00:03:38.590> heating<00:03:39.070> here<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.670> I'm

could have this for dinner one night and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.460 
could have this for dinner one night and
then<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.269> as<00:03:46.480> after<00:03:46.870> everyone<00:03:47.079> picks<00:03:47.290> away

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
then just as after everyone picks away

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.720 
then just as after everyone picks away
at<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.829> leave<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.980> little<00:03:48.130> bit<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.519> meat

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
at it you can leave a little bit of meat

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.699 
at it you can leave a little bit of meat
on<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.940> bone<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.959> we're<00:03:50.049> just<00:03:50.079> gonna<00:03:50.230> toss<00:03:50.530> in

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
on the bone but we're just gonna toss in

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.140 
on the bone but we're just gonna toss in
the<00:03:50.799> bone<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:50.980> kept<00:03:51.250> some<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.579> drumsticks

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the bone I kept some of the drumsticks

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.599 
the bone I kept some of the drumsticks
and<00:03:52.450> I'm<00:03:52.930> gonna<00:03:53.049> reserve<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:54.070> some<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
and I'm gonna reserve the some of the

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.099 
and I'm gonna reserve the some of the
meat<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:54.970> pulled<00:03:55.239> off<00:03:55.359> for<00:03:55.600> after<00:03:56.079> I

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
meat that I pulled off for after I

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.319 
meat that I pulled off for after I
strained<00:03:56.500> my<00:03:56.560> bra<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.670> we'll<00:03:57.820> let<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.030> chicken

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
strained my bra so we'll let the chicken

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.520 
strained my bra so we'll let the chicken
sit<00:03:58.359> in<00:03:58.660> there<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.049> then<00:03:59.170> I'm<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.410> gonna

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
sit in there and then I'm just gonna

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.560 
sit in there and then I'm just gonna
quarter<00:04:00.070> an<00:04:00.190> onion<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:06.940> again<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.390> is

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
quarter an onion and so again this is

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.449 
quarter an onion and so again this is
something<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.140> say<00:04:08.350> we<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:08.709> make

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
something that you say we can just make

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.270 
something that you say we can just make
really<00:04:09.850> real<00:04:10.120> absolutely<00:04:10.930> we<00:04:11.350> always<00:04:11.829> hear

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
really real absolutely we always hear

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.220 
really real absolutely we always hear
that<00:04:12.310> chicken<00:04:12.850> soup<00:04:13.120> can<00:04:13.450> help<00:04:13.750> when<00:04:14.079> you're

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that chicken soup can help when you're

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.259 
that chicken soup can help when you're
sick<00:04:14.650> or<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.920> can<00:04:15.100> help<00:04:15.280> boost<00:04:15.910> your<00:04:16.060> immune

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
sick or that can help boost your immune

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.449 
sick or that can help boost your immune
system<00:04:16.299> what<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.229> about<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.220> there's

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
system what is it about it so there's

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.120 
system what is it about it so there's
two<00:04:18.940> amino<00:04:19.390> acids<00:04:19.870> found<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.410> bone<00:04:20.650> there

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
two amino acids found in the bone there

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.580 
two amino acids found in the bone there
is<00:04:21.370> one<00:04:21.789> called<00:04:21.970> cysteine<00:04:22.510> which<00:04:22.840> actually

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
is one called cysteine which actually

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.420 
is one called cysteine which actually
mimics

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
mimics

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.029 
mimics
a<00:04:24.840> acetylcysteine<00:04:25.840> compound<00:04:26.620> that's<00:04:26.710> used<00:04:26.830> in

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
a acetylcysteine compound that's used in

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.920 
a acetylcysteine compound that's used in
bronchitis<00:04:27.460> medications<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.509> there's

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
bronchitis medications and there's

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.320 
bronchitis medications and there's
another<00:04:29.259> amino<00:04:29.620> acid<00:04:29.949> called<00:04:30.070> glutamine<00:04:30.699> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
another amino acid called glutamine that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.150 
another amino acid called glutamine that
they're<00:04:31.630> both<00:04:31.810> released<00:04:32.229> from<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> bone<00:04:32.919> and

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
they're both released from the bone and

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.490 
they're both released from the bone and
the<00:04:33.550> glutamine<00:04:34.000> helps<00:04:34.419> to<00:04:34.660> heal<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.110> gut<00:04:35.289> and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
the glutamine helps to heal the gut and

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.740 
the glutamine helps to heal the gut and
boost<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.919> immune<00:04:36.070> system<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.449> I'm<00:04:37.570> just

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
boost the immune system so I'm just

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.350 
boost the immune system so I'm just
roughly<00:04:38.139> chopping<00:04:38.530> just<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.039> thirds<00:04:39.370> carrots

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
roughly chopping just in thirds carrots

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.420 
roughly chopping just in thirds carrots
celery<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.169> onion<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.680> quarter<00:04:42.009> and<00:04:42.190> kept<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
celery and onion I quarter and kept the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.620 
celery and onion I quarter and kept the
skin<00:04:42.610> on<00:04:42.669> you'll<00:04:42.910> see<00:04:43.060> for<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.270> onion<00:04:43.509> that

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
skin on you'll see for the onion that

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.450 
skin on you'll see for the onion that
cuz<00:04:43.750> it's<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.960> nice<00:04:44.110> yellow<00:04:44.380> color<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.220> then

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
cuz it's a nice yellow color and then

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.830 
cuz it's a nice yellow color and then
you're<00:04:45.580> gonna<00:04:45.669> want<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:45.970> put<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.300> trick<00:04:46.539> to<00:04:46.720> it

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
you're gonna want to put the trick to it

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.629 
you're gonna want to put the trick to it
is<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.139> putting<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.650> little<00:04:47.860> bit<00:04:47.979> of<00:04:48.190> vinegar

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
is is putting a little bit of vinegar

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.040 
is is putting a little bit of vinegar
and<00:04:48.729> this<00:04:48.820> helps<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> leach<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.419> minerals<00:04:49.930> out

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
and this helps to leach the minerals out

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.620 
and this helps to leach the minerals out
of<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.440> bone<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.060> that's<00:04:52.419> gonna<00:04:52.539> be

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
of the bone and so that's gonna be

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.270 
of the bone and so that's gonna be
really<00:04:52.990> important<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.830> optimal

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
really important to get the optimal

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.010 
really important to get the optimal
mineral<00:04:54.639> content<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.300> about<00:04:55.419> two<00:04:55.600> tablespoons

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
mineral content so about two tablespoons

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.260 
mineral content so about two tablespoons
and<00:04:56.590> then<00:04:57.099> you<00:04:57.220> do<00:04:57.430> want<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.639> be<00:04:57.759> a<00:04:57.789> little<00:04:58.120> bit

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
and then you do want to be a little bit

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.180 
and then you do want to be a little bit
generous<00:04:58.509> keep<00:04:59.289> in<00:04:59.380> mind<00:04:59.530> there's<00:04:59.650> no<00:04:59.800> sodium

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
generous keep in mind there's no sodium

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.860 
generous keep in mind there's no sodium
in<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.490> all<00:05:00.550> yet<00:05:00.880> so<00:05:01.389> I'm<00:05:01.449> gonna<00:05:01.539> put<00:05:01.840> a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
in this at all yet so I'm gonna put a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.350 
in this at all yet so I'm gonna put a
good<00:05:01.960> tablespoon<00:05:02.620> or<00:05:02.979> two<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.160> sea<00:05:03.759> salt<00:05:04.060> in

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
good tablespoon or two of sea salt in

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.810 
good tablespoon or two of sea salt in
there<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:05.349> salt<00:05:05.590> helps<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.979> thin<00:05:06.250> our<00:05:06.400> mucus

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
there the salt helps to thin our mucus

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.930 
there the salt helps to thin our mucus
ducts<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:08.289> like<00:05:08.650> we<00:05:08.770> said<00:05:08.949> earlier<00:05:08.979> you<00:05:09.370> want

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
ducts and like we said earlier you want

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.300 
ducts and like we said earlier you want
to<00:05:10.000> keep<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.270> mucus<00:05:10.960> areas<00:05:11.259> nice<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.770> moist

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
to keep the mucus areas nice and moist

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.850 
to keep the mucus areas nice and moist
to<00:05:12.639> discourage<00:05:13.449> bacteria<00:05:14.050> know<00:05:14.199> to<00:05:14.410> use<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.590> bay

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
to discourage bacteria know to use a bay

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.339 
to discourage bacteria know to use a bay
leaf<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:15.400> chose<00:05:16.240> one<00:05:16.509> or<00:05:16.630> two<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.050> we<00:05:17.139> can<00:05:17.169> do

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
leaf I chose one or two and we can do

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.200 
leaf I chose one or two and we can do
that<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:18.009> that's<00:05:18.220> gonna<00:05:18.340> be<00:05:18.520> nice<00:05:18.669> for<00:05:18.849> flavor

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
that and that's gonna be nice for flavor

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.939 
that and that's gonna be nice for flavor
to<00:05:19.479> just<00:05:19.630> keep<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.900> all<00:05:19.990> around<00:05:20.259> good<00:05:20.470> okay

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
it or what I actually do is I'll dab it

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.040 
it or what I actually do is I'll dab it
on<00:05:42.159> my<00:05:42.250> shower<00:05:42.520> walls<00:05:42.940> allowing<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.659> steam<00:05:43.900> to

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
on my shower walls allowing the steam to

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.719 
on my shower walls allowing the steam to
create<00:05:44.260> a<00:05:44.289> vapor<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:45.190> keeps<00:05:45.400> everything

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
create a vapor that keeps everything

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.219 
create a vapor that keeps everything
really<00:05:46.060> moist<00:05:46.449> in<00:05:46.659> your<00:05:46.750> system<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.139> you

actually<00:05:49.360> both<00:05:49.780> eucalyptus<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.710> the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
actually both eucalyptus and the

antibacterial so they're fighting the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.950 
antibacterial so they're fighting the
bugs<00:05:54.699> in<00:05:54.849> your<00:05:54.970> system<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.330> can<00:05:55.570> breathe<00:05:55.780> them

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
bugs in your system you can breathe them

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.089 
bugs in your system you can breathe them
into<00:05:56.199> the<00:05:56.289> areas<00:05:56.590> where<00:05:56.770> we're<00:05:56.949> really
