00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.890
 good afternoon friends topic 7 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.480
 him video boyle that is fight on 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.970
 used in masses for carp fishing 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.990
 Well, although they tiles crucian as far as 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.029
 people told me friends 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.340
 We went to her 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.059
 sweet stuff i'm strawberry i'm quite 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.710
 can swallow about such more than 14 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.110
 of course means what will be discussed 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.379
 it is in this video that is it to 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.370
 tackle called hair rig 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.720
 that is, for catching something on what it is 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.180
 consists means the most lead 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:02.390
 Well, such a flood material his case 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:05.540
 a hook and more that is the most how to knit 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.530
 we omit this snap in this video 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.210
 will not show because well 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:19.119
 mass information on this topic mass video 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.770
 so it is on 52 we leave aside 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.710
 but there is another option 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:30.679
 fastening the head on the hooks that is 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.219
 Attachments will be slightly different but 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:38.200
 now I want you 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:42.109
 how to demonstrate this method i 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.859
 I think someone does not want to bother with 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.860
 hair snap then you can just 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.100
 quite simply 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:58.650
 grow up sitting there and do this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:02:02.550
 plan to start take more than us 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.360
 so we need to make a hole in 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.920
 boogles 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.390
 i.e. through hole for hole 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:18.060
 we will use this nose 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:22.709
 Christmas tree is now on size 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.550
 gon for what let's say it is done 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.090
 according 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.300
 issue you see well 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.800
 make a hole with u such a lubricant 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.709
 so therefore the acceptable sun is me 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.810
 I think it should 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:45.080
 fisherman present in any more 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.080
 the one who likes to catch it to the full 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.969
 yes all 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.060
 the hole we made now is further needed 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:58.840
 there will be such a thing that is she 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.120
 sold you well such a set in pairs 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.400
 i.e. this is a snoop for tying 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.879
 God does not need and knit knots that is how 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:17.780
 then there will help to hook but in such a plan 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:26.569
 means we do hooks skip 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:27.739
 through the bolt holes I forgot it is important to 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.889
 13 thread 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.879
 then we take the thread in this case 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:39.349
 white thread you can say 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:45.200
 use different colors so and that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:49.780
 do next take the thread and take 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.900
 hooks dress the thread on the hook 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.549
 monadas hook 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:07.019
 don't close it close the circle and 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:12.590
 we stretch the hook through the fight along with 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:16.579
 thread that is, open the hook 2 and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.579
 we have such a plan 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:28.139
 gizmo that is a boiler 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:34.460
 and does not pass through it. now take 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.460
 thread simply knot 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.490
 tying knot 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:55.369
 still an extra distortion of business with you not 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:55.369
 disbanded because it is not. ready 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.599
 give more 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.409
 cut off all the excess 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:21.580
 and it turned out we have such a thing fail 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:24.050
 or a thread goes through it 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.599
 just shopping 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:33.639
 Well, now we take 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:38.870
 hook our hook and do the following 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:46.120
 hooks as if to tackle under not so 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.120
 so that's it 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:56.210
 carp fishing gear 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:06:00.650
 yes not only dad ready with us let's 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:05.360
 tasty pasta comparison yes yes there is 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:08.680
 A little two differences, but I think it 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:14.440
 there will be many more fruitful us 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.440
 work all see you on my channel
