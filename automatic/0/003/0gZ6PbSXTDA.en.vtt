hereditary<00:00:03.990> theory<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> idea<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.130> many

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
hereditary theory is the idea that many

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.309 
hereditary theory is the idea that many
physical<00:00:05.879> traits<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.600> be<00:00:06.660> passed<00:00:07.020> from<00:00:07.200> one

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
physical traits can be passed from one

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.020 
physical traits can be passed from one
generation<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.519> next

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
generation to the next

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.440 
generation to the next
by<00:00:09.420> DNA<00:00:10.380> by<00:00:10.559> passing<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.059> set<00:00:12.330> of

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
your offspring you pass on the physical

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.370 
your offspring you pass on the physical
traits<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.550> possess<00:00:17.880> yourself<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:19.199> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
traits that you possess yourself this is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290 
traits that you possess yourself this is
all<00:00:19.590> based<00:00:19.920> our<00:00:20.189> modern<00:00:20.699> understanding<00:00:20.789> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
all based our modern understanding is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.240 
all based our modern understanding is
all<00:00:21.480> based<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.930> Mendel's<00:00:22.410> work<00:00:22.470> prior<00:00:23.039> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
all based on Mendel's work prior to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.089 
all based on Mendel's work prior to
Mendel<00:00:23.640> people<00:00:24.269> had<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.510> idea<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.930> maybe

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
Mendel people had this idea that maybe

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.550 
Mendel people had this idea that maybe
there<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.220> blending<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.260> very

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
there was blending going on it was very

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.630 
there was blending going on it was very
complex<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.119> didn't<00:00:30.480> match<00:00:30.900> reality

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
complex and it just didn't match reality

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
complex and it just didn't match reality
but<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.910> he<00:00:33.059> discovered<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:34.380> most

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
but what he discovered is that with most

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.280 
but what he discovered is that with most
traits<00:00:35.309> you'll<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.059> dominant<00:00:36.660> versions<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
traits you'll have dominant versions and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
traits you'll have dominant versions and
recessive<00:00:37.739> versions<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> you'll<00:00:38.640> typically

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
recessive versions and you'll typically

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.290 
recessive versions and you'll typically
get<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.480> copies<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.350> gene<00:00:40.730> two<00:00:41.730> alleles<00:00:42.090> for

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
get two copies of a gene two alleles for

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170 
get two copies of a gene two alleles for
every<00:00:42.629> gene<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.040> how<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.309> interact<00:00:45.030> with

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
every gene and how they interact with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.580 
every gene and how they interact with
each<00:00:45.300> other<00:00:45.450> determines<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.170> physical

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
each other determines what physical

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
each other determines what physical
traits<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.160> now<00:00:47.850> since<00:00:48.420> Mendel's<00:00:48.899> time

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
traits you have now since Mendel's time

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.389 
traits you have now since Mendel's time
we've<00:00:49.320> discovered<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> lot<00:00:50.190> more

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
we've discovered it is a lot more

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
we've discovered it is a lot more
complicated<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:51.030> he<00:00:51.539> initially<00:00:51.750> thought

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
complicated than he initially thought

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
complicated than he initially thought
there's<00:00:52.500> things<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.890> can't<00:00:53.160> code<00:00:53.579> dominance

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
there's things I can't code dominance

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.619 
there's things I can't code dominance
where<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.329> gene<00:00:55.260> may<00:00:55.820> share<00:00:56.820> its<00:00:57.149> dominance

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
where one gene may share its dominance

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
where one gene may share its dominance
with<00:00:57.780> another<00:00:58.050> gene<00:00:58.350> etc<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
with another gene etc but one of the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
with another gene etc but one of the
more<00:01:00.000> complex<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:01.230> helps<00:01:01.649> us<00:01:01.800> better

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
more complex things that helps us better

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
more complex things that helps us better
understand<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.090> world<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.960> we've

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
understand the world is that we've

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
understand the world is that we've
learned<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.739> traits<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.580> not

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
learned that some traits are not

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.280 
learned that some traits are not
controlled<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.479> gene<00:01:06.750> they're

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
controlled by one gene they're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.830 
controlled by one gene they're
controlled<00:01:07.650> by<00:01:07.770> many<00:01:08.040> genes<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:09.210> prime

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
controlled by many genes and a prime

controlled by many genes and a prime
example<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.740> height<00:01:11.130> your<00:01:11.909> height<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
example of this is height your height is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.320 
example of this is height your height is
determined<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.409> by<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.860> gene<00:01:14.159> say<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
determined not just by one gene say the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
determined not just by one gene say the
amount<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> growth<00:01:15.930> hormone<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
amount of growth hormone that you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
amount of growth hormone that you
produce<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.400> also<00:01:17.549> influenced<00:01:18.210> by<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
produce but it's also influenced by the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.210 
produce but it's also influenced by the
genes<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.650> absorption<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
genes you have for the absorption of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
genes you have for the absorption of
calcium<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.420> lactose<00:01:21.630> intolerant

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
calcium if you're lactose intolerant

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.830 
calcium if you're lactose intolerant
you'll<00:01:22.680> tend<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.220> drink<00:01:23.610> less<00:01:23.790> milk<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you'll tend to drink less milk and so

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.149 
you'll tend to drink less milk and so
you'll<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.110> getting<00:01:25.229> less<00:01:25.500> calcium<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.130> your

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you'll be getting less calcium in your

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.530 
you'll be getting less calcium in your
diet<00:01:26.280> unless<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.180> sources

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
diet unless you get from other sources

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.410 
diet unless you get from other sources
so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.920> won't<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.700> growing<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.390> fast

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so that you won't be growing as fast

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.319 
so that you won't be growing as fast
because<00:01:30.869> your<00:01:31.220> your<00:01:32.220> osteoblasts<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> cells

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because your your osteoblasts the cells

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.640 
because your your osteoblasts the cells
that<00:01:33.450> build<00:01:33.570> bones<00:01:33.869> won't<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.530> much

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that build bones won't have as much

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
discovered that your environment

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
discovered that your environment
influences<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.000> genes<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.540> lots<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.110> ways

of<00:01:51.479> epigenetics<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> idea<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
of epigenetics this is the idea that

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.980 
of epigenetics this is the idea that
your<00:01:54.360> environment<00:01:55.020> right<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:56.040> diet<00:01:56.460> etc

your environment right now your diet etc

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.980 
your environment right now your diet etc
can<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.439> cause<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:59.450> slight<00:02:00.450> chemical

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
can actually cause some slight chemical

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.990 
can actually cause some slight chemical
changes<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.560> DNA<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.250> between<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
DNA and you can apparently pass these

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
generations past your own so they have

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.690 
generations past your own so they have
