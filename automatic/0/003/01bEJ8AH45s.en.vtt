00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
after the convoy is defended now how

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.330 
after the convoy is defended now how
long<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:20.990> takes<00:05:21.200> them<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.440> defend<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.920> convoy

depends<00:05:22.760> I've<00:05:23.150> had<00:05:23.390> ones<00:05:23.660> where<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.020> takes<00:05:24.170> two

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
depends I've had ones where it takes two

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.800 
depends I've had ones where it takes two
minutes<00:05:24.650> I've<00:05:25.160> had<00:05:25.460> ones<00:05:25.790> where<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.180> takes<00:05:26.360> ten

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
minutes I've had ones where it takes ten

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.010 
minutes I've had ones where it takes ten
minutes<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:28.150> it's<00:05:29.150> really<00:05:29.390> difficult<00:05:29.720> to

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
minutes so it's really difficult to

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.860 
minutes so it's really difficult to
determine<00:05:30.260> how<00:05:30.560> long<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:30.890> will<00:05:31.310> take

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
determine how long it will take

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.810 
determine how long it will take
unless<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:33.080> just<00:05:33.350> look<00:05:33.980> at<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.190> menu<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.520> see
