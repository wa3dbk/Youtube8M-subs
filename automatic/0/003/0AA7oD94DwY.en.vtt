00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.200
 almost a week after the release of the 7-seater version of the C4 Picasso but 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.900
 citroën we put the cover with the 5 places in the segment 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 ultracompetitive compact minivans 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.400
 this newcomer we will try to distinguish itself by its advantageous plastic 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 and these technologies and watch 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.329
 I'm going to think about his earth grille the xsara picasso had already 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.579
 sold more than one million four hundred thousand copies since 2000 and the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.579
 large version 7 seats and the new minivan 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.880
 bigger than 19 centimeters and the first picasso he lost 12 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.940
 centimeters and two places compared to the big c4 picasso who adopt 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.020
 now this new name 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 the main difference and is played at the rear overhang two 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.490
 wreaths on the newcomer 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.440
 europe style and design side did not just shrink the big c4 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.260
 the front we get a more aggressive shield but it's more back 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.150
 and which has been the most reworked 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.250
 exit the vertical taillights 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.469
 then replaced with beautifully drawn horizontal patterns 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.060
 which now bite on the side flanks the fall of the flag very 

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:17.159
 pronounced he participates the oci to the dynamism of the vehicle 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.170
 in the cockpit we find the concept of video space richert in citroën en 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.280
 effect what strikes input and this is the brightness offered by the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 panoramic windshield of two square meters this benefits the sensation 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.090
 of spaced rattles confirmed by the inner ratings leave the c4 picasso 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.110
 one of the longest in the category of 5 places 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.630
 the dashboard partly taken from the sedan presents materials of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050
 quality adjusted with oneself 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.170
 at the rear the three independent seats of identical size 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 allow three burials to settle comfortably 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.290
 the modularity is reinforced by the flat floor that we obtain without 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.830
 be forced to remove any seat as to the trunk its capacity of 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.020
 500 liters will allow you to carry without any fear anyway 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:18.869
 2,658 handed 237 horses and two liters of 143 horses 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.549
 and two diesel iron age 10,638 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.069
 it is the latter that fitted our model the new automatic transmission 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.539
 six-speed 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:32.099
 with a couple culminating at 340 to know me we could have imagined enough 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.059
 demonstrative 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:38.259
 unfortunately the weight of the machine 1715 the tamales that engine that is struggling soon 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.949
 we ask him 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.739
 and let it know by snorting in the cockpit 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.489
 the whipping mechanics is also climbing the consumption that 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.439
 never went down 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.029
 8 liters per 100 km 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.029
 during our test 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.540
 the 5-seater picasso takes over the ground connections of the grand c4 picasso 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.700
 but by changing these amortization laws it results in a 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.659
 very safe behavior with a front train providing good accuracy of 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.149
 driving and a rear train is literally shortly 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.469
 braking side this minivan is not outdone it is distinguished by its 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.459
 system 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 and enduring 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.520
 who does it anyway? 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.969
 new segment reference 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.629
 we regret just the slight lack of liveliness of the version 2 liters hdi 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.539
 what to do with no less than a ton between the two front wheels 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.670
 the 4 610 horsepower version of a quintal 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 a better compromise 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.299
 with this new c4 picasso 5 places the brand chauveron and well armed and 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.299
 expects stiff competition despite low tariffs 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.599
 starting at 19 8 901 euros in petrol engine 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.049
 it would be conducted from 27,000 without the Euro to 138 horsepower diesel
