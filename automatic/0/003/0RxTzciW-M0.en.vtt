I'm<00:02:23.950> kinda<00:02:24.950> lost<00:02:25.129> on<00:02:25.459> why<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:27.110> won't<00:02:27.470> run<00:02:28.340> right

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
I'm kinda lost on why it won't run right

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.699 
I'm kinda lost on why it won't run right
I<00:02:29.150> mean<00:02:29.330> it'll<00:02:29.540> crash<00:02:29.840> occasionally<00:02:30.500> but

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
I mean it'll crash occasionally but

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.380 
I mean it'll crash occasionally but
since<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.069> lowered<00:02:31.550> all<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.819> settings<00:02:32.209> down

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
since I lowered all the settings down

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.949 
since I lowered all the settings down
pretty<00:02:32.780> low<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:34.580> been<00:02:34.879> fine<00:02:35.090> okay<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:35.750> if

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
pretty low it's been fine okay so if

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.460 
pretty low it's been fine okay so if
you're<00:02:36.110> in<00:02:36.260> game<00:02:36.500> options<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.430> you're<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:37.879> the
