00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.640
 hi the wolves it's nono I you 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.920
 find for a little video like that 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.240
 to larache to show you that there is 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.710
 not that pink flowers that can 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.780
 hold to the agreement like sick when 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.220
 we use vibrato including 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.590
 the effigiÃ© then nova it is in the presence 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.730
 from an excalibur vision supra that was 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.839
 slightly modified at the level of 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.939
 microbes and that's not what we 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.279
 interest what interests us is the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.869
 vibrato which is a record number vibrato 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.019
 of these ponds so this turnover to 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.970
 logs with a threshold and not blocking at 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.309
 turn once the lock is so 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.780
 tied a teflon ropes guide all the 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.970
 world is talking about it but no one will climb 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.230
 we will see we kill little what it gives to the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.180
 level of agreement holding this 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.880
 vibrato there so I plugged my guitar 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.380
 in a politics of selectour nics and 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.010
 we will check the agreement before 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.010
 play do not know 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.760
 nickel there we see that all the strings 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.219
 are perfectly tuned to the nearest hair 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.899
 I cut 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.949
 the tuner and let's go for the 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.949
 frenetic vibrate esque 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.580
 they checked okay it's gone 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.450
 at 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.490
 I saw it's still pretty 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.410
 hallucinating this vibrato there and frankly 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.410
 a big massacre I say more
