00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.880 
out it's a really good question because
it<00:00:24.619> was<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.770> really<00:00:25.130> hard<00:00:25.369> thing<00:00:25.400> for<00:00:25.820> me<00:00:26.619> as<00:00:27.619> you

it was a really hard thing for me as you
know<00:00:28.099> all<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.789> previous<00:00:29.150> books<00:00:29.420> I<00:00:29.570> adapted<00:00:30.170> I

did<00:00:30.590> in<00:00:30.740> one<00:00:30.859> movie<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:31.519> instantly<00:00:32.210> you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
did in one movie so instantly you

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.689 
did in one movie so instantly you
certain<00:00:33.230> decisions<00:00:33.620> are<00:00:33.739> honestly<00:00:34.190> made<00:00:34.400> for

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
you I mean you know you can't have this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.590 
you I mean you know you can't have this
again<00:00:36.500> at<00:00:36.589> this<00:00:36.739> on<00:00:37.070> this<00:00:37.820> instead<00:00:38.449> of<00:00:38.510> having

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
again at this on this instead of having

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.240 
again at this on this instead of having
two<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.080> a<00:00:39.110> half<00:00:39.230> hours<00:00:39.470> of<00:00:39.500> screen<00:00:39.800> time<00:00:39.830> I

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
two and a half hours of screen time I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.530 
two and a half hours of screen time I
had<00:00:40.339> five<00:00:40.580> hours<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.970> screen<00:00:41.180> time<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.480> I

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
had five hours of screen time and I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.700 
had five hours of screen time and I
thought<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.839> gonna<00:00:41.960> be<00:00:42.110> fantastic<00:00:42.230> it's

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
thought this is gonna be fantastic it's

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.299 
thought this is gonna be fantastic it's
gonna<00:00:42.829> be<00:00:42.980> easy

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
gonna be easy

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.770 
gonna be easy
and<00:00:43.550> suddenly<00:00:43.790> I<00:00:43.940> open<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.239> book<00:00:44.329> I<00:00:44.390> go<00:00:44.600> wait<00:00:44.750> a

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
and suddenly I open the book I go wait a

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.270 
and suddenly I open the book I go wait a
minute<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.079> decisions<00:00:45.500> aren't<00:00:45.680> made<00:00:45.799> for<00:00:46.190> me

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
minute the decisions aren't made for me

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.649 
minute the decisions aren't made for me
anymore<00:00:46.460> I've<00:00:46.729> got<00:00:46.909> to<00:00:47.000> actually<00:00:47.150> kind<00:00:47.629> of

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
anymore I've got to actually kind of

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.049 
anymore I've got to actually kind of
figure<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.110> out<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.320> little<00:00:48.500> bit<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.010> I<00:00:49.549> mean

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
figure this out a little bit and I mean

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.189 
figure this out a little bit and I mean
it<00:00:50.150> means<00:00:50.239> slightly<00:00:50.570> facetious<00:00:50.720> but<00:00:51.110> not

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
it means slightly facetious but not

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.960 
it means slightly facetious but not
really<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:51.530> was<00:00:51.619> very<00:00:51.680> hard<00:00:52.250> when<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.519> started

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
really it was very hard when I started

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.689 
really it was very hard when I started
hallows<00:00:53.390> can<00:00:54.260> kind<00:00:54.830> of<00:00:54.860> find<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.159> rhythm<00:00:55.339> of

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
hallows can kind of find the rhythm of

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.490 
hallows can kind of find the rhythm of
the<00:00:55.820> choices<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.479> what<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.809> emphasize<00:00:56.960> what

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
the choices and what to emphasize what

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.280 
the choices and what to emphasize what
to<00:00:57.650> lose<00:00:57.860> I<00:00:58.159> found<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:59.119> rhythm<00:00:59.510> but<00:01:00.019> but

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
to lose I found that rhythm but but

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.689 
to lose I found that rhythm but but
initially<00:01:00.769> it<00:01:00.830> was<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:00.949> little<00:01:01.159> bit<00:01:01.339> kind<00:01:01.670> of

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
initially it was a little bit kind of

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.939 
initially it was a little bit kind of
tough<00:01:02.299> sledding<00:01:02.540> because<00:01:03.439> of<00:01:03.559> what<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.710> said

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
tough sledding because of what I said

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.800 
tough sledding because of what I said
you<00:01:04.100> know<00:01:04.189> what<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:04.339> was<00:01:04.430> talking<00:01:04.580> about<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:10.850> just

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
you know what I was talking about I just

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.780 
you know what I was talking about I just
think<00:01:12.520> in<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.820> very<00:01:14.060> cynical<00:01:14.750> age<00:01:15.220> what<00:01:16.220> Joe<00:01:16.549> has

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
think in a very cynical age what Joe has

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.690 
think in a very cynical age what Joe has
done<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.170> she<00:01:18.380> presents<00:01:18.620> things<00:01:19.310> like

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
done is that she presents things like

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.240 
done is that she presents things like
loyalty<00:01:20.480> and<00:01:20.690> courage<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.440> friendship<00:01:21.710> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
loyalty and courage and friendship and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.220 
loyalty and courage and friendship and
honor<00:01:23.150> in<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:24.530> way<00:01:24.710> that's<00:01:24.920> completely

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
honor in a way that's completely

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.720 
honor in a way that's completely
unsaturated<00:01:27.230> and<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.620> think<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.460> world

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
unsaturated and I think so the world

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.200 
unsaturated and I think so the world
world<00:01:29.720> hungers<00:01:30.350> for<00:01:30.380> those<00:01:30.830> things<00:01:31.220> they<00:01:32.000> just

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
world hungers for those things they just

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.790 
world hungers for those things they just
don't<00:01:32.450> want<00:01:32.690> them<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.960> be<00:01:33.050> presented<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.620> this

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
don't want them to be presented in this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.680 
don't want them to be presented in this
cloying<00:01:34.430> saccharine<00:01:35.000> way<00:01:35.150> they<00:01:35.360> want<00:01:35.540> them<00:01:35.570> to

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
cloying saccharine way they want them to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.710 
cloying saccharine way they want them to
be<00:01:36.200> presented<00:01:36.680> earnestly<00:01:37.550> but<00:01:37.820> real<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.420> she

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
be presented earnestly but real and she

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.140 
be presented earnestly but real and she
does<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.980> think<00:01:40.550> we've<00:01:40.880> been<00:01:41.030> able

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150

representation of the book and we then

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.680 
representation of the book and we then
have<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.750> satisfy<00:03:37.049> Jo<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.579> when<00:03:39.060> she<00:03:39.239> sees<00:03:39.510> it
