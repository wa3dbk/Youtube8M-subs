00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
get unlimited vehicles that part was

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.060 
get unlimited vehicles that part was
easy<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.110> trying<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> make

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
easy but in this I was trying to make

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.639 
easy but in this I was trying to make
this<00:00:35.190> machine<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> had<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> 100%<00:00:37.140> chance

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
this machine that had a 100% chance

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
this machine that had a 100% chance
success<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.760> always<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> turret

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
success to always take off the turret
and<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.559> took<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.770> forever<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> make

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and that's what took me forever to make

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
and that's what took me forever to make
this<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.790> mean<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.300> about<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.050> one

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this I mean if you think about it if one

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.049 
this I mean if you think about it if one
guy<00:00:43.500> gets<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> turret<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.700> game<00:00:44.879> is

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.780 
little hillside we call you C's Hill
there's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.710> reason<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.130> call<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.460> Cecil

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
there's a reason we call you Cecil

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
there's a reason we call you Cecil
you'll<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.479> later<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:56.810> yeah

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you'll see a little bit later but yeah

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.280 
you'll see a little bit later but yeah
so<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.380> essentially<00:01:58.770> run<00:01:59.130> away<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> cat

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
so it essentially run away from the cat

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.520 
so it essentially run away from the cat
so<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:01.920> will<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.070> many<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.530> here's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so because there will be many and here's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.940 
so because there will be many and here's
how<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.710> point<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.310> you're<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
how you point if you're a

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.180 
how you point if you're a
you<00:02:06.310> get<00:02:06.490> one<00:02:06.640> point<00:02:06.850> for<00:02:07.240> every<00:02:08.110> Mouse<00:02:08.920> that

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
you get one point for every Mouse that

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.780 
you get one point for every Mouse that
you<00:02:09.399> kill<00:02:10.530> yeah<00:02:11.530> also<00:02:11.769> when<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.340> last<00:02:12.519> man

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you kill yeah also when you last man

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.030 
you kill yeah also when you last man
standing<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.390> earn<00:02:13.540> 5<00:02:13.840> points<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.739> that's<00:02:14.890> for

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
standing you earn 5 points so that's for

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.770 
standing you earn 5 points so that's for
the<00:02:15.099> mice<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.700> your<00:02:15.879> Last<00:02:16.090> Man<00:02:16.209> Standing<00:02:16.360> you

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
the mice if your Last Man Standing you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780 
the mice if your Last Man Standing you
get<00:02:16.900> 5<00:02:17.110> points<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.280> also<00:02:18.430> get<00:02:18.670> an

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
get 5 points and then you also get an

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.050 
get 5 points and then you also get an
extra<00:02:19.060> five<00:02:19.239> points<00:02:19.660> if<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> survive<00:02:20.280> ok<00:02:21.280> yeah

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
extra five points if you survive ok yeah

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.920 
extra five points if you survive ok yeah
so<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:22.630> possible<00:02:22.840> 10<00:02:23.230> points<00:02:23.910> if<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.269> are

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
so it's possible 10 points if you are

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.960 
so it's possible 10 points if you are
the<00:02:26.110> last<00:02:26.290> man<00:02:26.560> standing<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.670> make<00:02:27.849> it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the last man standing and you make it

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.729 
the last man standing and you make it
till<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.390> what<00:02:28.900> are<00:02:28.959> they<00:02:29.080> 4<00:02:29.319> minute<00:02:29.530> games

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
till the what are they 4 minute games

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.400 
till the what are they 4 minute games

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
yes see Darth is just a pro at this math

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.080 
yes see Darth is just a pro at this math
that's<00:02:35.560> why<00:02:35.709> he<00:02:35.860> spent<00:02:36.129> so<00:02:36.280> long<00:02:36.400> making<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.910> v

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
that's why he spent so long making it v

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.479 
that's why he spent so long making it v
twice<00:02:37.629> now<00:02:37.870> I've<00:02:37.900> seen<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.590> where<00:02:39.160> he<00:02:39.280> should

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
twice now I've seen and where he should

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.580 
twice now I've seen and where he should
have<00:02:39.580> died<00:02:39.790> or<00:02:40.060> he<00:02:40.150> he<00:02:40.660> either<00:02:40.810> jumped<00:02:40.959> over<00:02:41.560> it

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
have died or he he either jumped over it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.729 
have died or he he either jumped over it
he<00:02:42.489> didn't<00:02:42.730> make<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.090> tile<00:02:43.480> even<00:02:44.410> jumped

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
he didn't make it that tile even jumped

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.740 
he didn't make it that tile even jumped
over<00:02:44.980> them<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.489> cat<00:02:45.730> or<00:02:46.000> he<00:02:46.150> jumped<00:02:46.450> under<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
over them the cat or he jumped under the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.289 
over them the cat or he jumped under the
cat<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.769> time<00:02:48.010> he<00:02:48.190> ran<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> boost<00:02:48.790> apparently

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
cat that time he ran a boost apparently

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.699 
cat that time he ran a boost apparently
so<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:49.780> let's<00:02:49.989> look<00:02:50.049> at<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.260> from<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.590> angle

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
so now let's look at it from the angle

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.569 
so now let's look at it from the angle
of<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> cat<00:02:51.450> okay<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.370> you'll<00:02:54.370> notice

of the cat okay and you'll notice

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.009 
of the cat okay and you'll notice

different<00:04:24.080> terrain<00:04:24.620> with<00:04:24.980> hills<00:04:25.220> there's

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
different terrain with hills there's

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.070 
different terrain with hills there's
lots<00:04:25.790> of<00:04:25.880> places<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.270> can<00:04:26.390> take<00:04:26.660> cover<00:04:26.840> and

lots of places you can take cover and
whatnot<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.670> can<00:04:28.850> boost<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.570> end<00:04:29.720> up

whatnot so you can boost but you end up

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.660 
whatnot so you can boost but you end up
slowing<00:04:30.110> down<00:04:30.380> because<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.920> go<00:04:31.190> uphill<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
you go downhill and you have the slight

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.900 
you go downhill and you have the slight
chance<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.650> getting<00:04:33.950> up<00:04:34.100> going<00:04:34.370> under<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.730> race

so<00:05:24.290> here<00:05:24.500> is<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:25.340> new<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.760> other<00:05:25.940> version<00:05:26.270> of

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
so here is the new the other version of

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.480 
so here is the new the other version of
the<00:05:26.419> map<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.770> tell<00:05:27.770> us<00:05:27.890> how<00:05:28.010> you<00:05:28.070> created<00:05:28.220> this

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
the map and tell us how you created this

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.460 
the map and tell us how you created this
map<00:05:28.669> because<00:05:28.790> it's<00:05:29.120> actually<00:05:29.300> really<00:05:30.290> clever

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
map because it's actually really clever

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.100 
map because it's actually really clever
thinking<00:05:30.919> on<00:05:31.010> how<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.160> did<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.750> basically<00:05:32.750> it's

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
thinking on how I did it basically it's

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.930 
thinking on how I did it basically it's
in<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.350> exact<00:05:33.680> same<00:05:33.890> spot<00:05:34.100> everything's<00:05:34.760> in

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
in the exact same spot everything's in

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.580 
in the exact same spot everything's in
its<00:05:35.060> same<00:05:35.270> place<00:05:35.540> except<00:05:36.050> that<00:05:36.140> took<00:05:36.320> out<00:05:36.470> the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
its same place except that took out the

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.800 
its same place except that took out the
rocks<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.160> then<00:05:37.550> I<00:05:37.580> lowered<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.090> ceiling<00:05:38.630> and

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
rocks and then I lowered the ceiling and

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.409 
rocks and then I lowered the ceiling and
so<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.550> course<00:05:40.760> I<00:05:40.850> had<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.060> raise<00:05:41.210> the

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
so and of course I had to raise the

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.390 
so and of course I had to raise the
machine<00:05:41.780> up<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.169> you<00:05:42.440> know<00:05:42.530> produces<00:05:43.010> and

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
machine up that you know produces and

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.719 
machine up that you know produces and
destroys<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.270> race<00:05:44.419> turret<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:46.130> had<00:05:46.640> to

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
destroys the race turret and I had to

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.850 
destroys the race turret and I had to
right<00:05:46.910> raise<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.479> ghost<00:05:47.930> spawn<00:05:48.169> area<00:05:48.530> but

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
right raise the ghost spawn area but

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.680 
right raise the ghost spawn area but
other<00:05:49.430> than<00:05:49.580> that<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:50.000> just<00:05:50.210> get<00:05:50.360> this<00:05:50.479> flat

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
other than that you just get this flat

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.930 
other than that you just get this flat
terrain<00:05:51.140> and<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:52.370> they're<00:05:52.490> actually<00:05:52.580> playing

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
terrain and so they're actually playing

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.430 
terrain and so they're actually playing
on<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.240> roof<00:05:53.390> is<00:05:53.570> what<00:05:53.690> you're<00:05:53.810> saying<00:05:54.020> yeah

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
on the roof is what you're saying yeah

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.490 
on the roof is what you're saying yeah
it's<00:05:54.770> a<00:05:54.919> few<00:05:55.070> dropped<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.520> yeah<00:05:56.000> awesome<00:05:56.810> now

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
it's a few dropped it yeah awesome now

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.380 
it's a few dropped it yeah awesome now
the<00:05:57.560> gameplay<00:05:57.890> is<00:05:58.220> different<00:05:58.610> here<00:05:58.790> a<00:05:59.030> little

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
the gameplay is different here a little

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.159 
the gameplay is different here a little
bit<00:05:59.570> because<00:05:59.930> it's<00:06:00.260> faster<00:06:00.740> in<00:06:01.010> my<00:06:01.160> opinion

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
bit because it's faster in my opinion

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.090 
bit because it's faster in my opinion
faster<00:06:03.169> in<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.320> sense<00:06:03.530> that<00:06:03.620> you<00:06:03.770> there's<00:06:03.979> not

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
faster in the sense that you there's not

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.520 
faster in the sense that you there's not
as<00:06:04.220> much<00:06:04.310> stop<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:04.790> go<00:06:04.880> you<00:06:05.030> tend<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.330> slide

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
as much stop and go you tend to slide

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.280 
as much stop and go you tend to slide
especially<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.250> race<00:06:07.870> when<00:06:08.870> they're<00:06:09.020> when

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
especially the race when they're when

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.050 
especially the race when they're when
they're<00:06:09.320> boosting<00:06:09.830> that<00:06:10.370> lose<00:06:10.610> their<00:06:10.640> moment

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
they're boosting that lose their moment

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.730 
they're boosting that lose their moment
I<00:06:11.150> don't<00:06:11.330> lose<00:06:11.479> their<00:06:11.600> momentum<00:06:11.750> right<00:06:12.110> so

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
I don't lose their momentum right so

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.610 
I don't lose their momentum right so
they<00:06:12.890> you<00:06:13.550> know<00:06:13.640> you<00:06:13.700> can

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
they you know you can

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.590 
they you know you can
but<00:06:15.220> one<00:06:15.699> thing<00:06:15.850> we<00:06:15.970> should<00:06:16.120> also<00:06:16.210> point<00:06:16.479> out

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
but one thing we should also point out

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.480 
but one thing we should also point out
that<00:06:16.660> I<00:06:16.840> haven't<00:06:17.380> pointed<00:06:17.919> out<00:06:18.130> yet<00:06:18.340> is<00:06:18.460> that

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
that I haven't pointed out yet is that

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.379 
that I haven't pointed out yet is that
the<00:06:19.120> cats<00:06:19.930> have<00:06:20.169> radar<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.979> mice<00:06:21.160> do<00:06:21.370> not<00:06:21.550> okay

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
the cats have radar the mice do not okay

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.480 
the cats have radar the mice do not okay
so<00:06:23.139> if<00:06:23.229> you're<00:06:23.380> on<00:06:23.470> a<00:06:23.500> ghost<00:06:23.740> you've<00:06:24.100> got<00:06:24.340> to

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
so if you're on a ghost you've got to

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.250 
so if you're on a ghost you've got to
constantly<00:06:24.790> be<00:06:25.180> looking<00:06:25.330> boom

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
constantly be looking boom

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.500 
constantly be looking boom
ouch<00:06:26.350> behind<00:06:27.340> you<00:06:27.520> or<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:27.850> your<00:06:27.970> left<00:06:28.210> or<00:06:28.419> to

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
ouch behind you or to your left or to

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.860 
ouch behind you or to your left or to
your<00:06:28.540> right<00:06:28.630> because<00:06:29.320> if<00:06:29.919> you<00:06:30.130> don't<00:06:30.160> all

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
your right because if you don't all

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.060 
your right because if you don't all
sudden<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:31.960> cat<00:06:32.110> can<00:06:32.290> sneak<00:06:32.590> up<00:06:32.740> and<00:06:32.830> pounce

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
sudden the cat can sneak up and pounce

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.260 
sudden the cat can sneak up and pounce
on<00:06:33.220> you<00:06:33.370> especially<00:06:33.430> especially<00:06:34.180> this

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
on you especially especially this

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.600 
on you especially especially this
version<00:06:34.449> I'd<00:06:34.870> actually<00:06:35.290> suggest<00:06:35.680> is<00:06:35.889> what<00:06:36.580> I

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
version I'd actually suggest is what I

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.250 
version I'd actually suggest is what I
usually<00:06:36.880> do<00:06:37.120> is<00:06:37.240> I<00:06:37.330> usually<00:06:37.479> boost<00:06:37.840> around<00:06:38.020> the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
usually do is I usually boost around the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.219 
usually do is I usually boost around the
map<00:06:38.440> hide<00:06:38.710> on<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.070> corners<00:06:39.460> of<00:06:39.790> the<00:06:40.229> cliff

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
map hide on the corners of the cliff

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.950 
map hide on the corners of the cliff
there<00:06:41.470> and<00:06:41.770> then<00:06:42.760> I<00:06:43.090> look<00:06:43.389> around<00:06:43.720> make<00:06:43.930> sure

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
there and then I look around make sure

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.780 
there and then I look around make sure
there's<00:06:44.350> no<00:06:44.500> Wraith<00:06:44.710> chasing<00:06:45.190> me<00:06:45.250> down<00:06:45.430> when<00:06:45.760> I

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
there's no Wraith chasing me down when I

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.909 
there's no Wraith chasing me down when I
when<00:06:46.330> I<00:06:46.360> have<00:06:46.570> a<00:06:46.600> spot<00:06:47.199> to<00:06:47.350> boost<00:06:47.560> that's<00:06:47.800> when

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
when I have a spot to boost that's when

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.770 
when I have a spot to boost that's when
I<00:06:48.010> boost<00:06:48.720> but<00:06:49.860> boom<00:06:51.060> how<00:06:52.060> did<00:06:52.270> you<00:06:52.360> survive

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
I boost but boom how did you survive

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.650 
I boost but boom how did you survive
that<00:06:53.490> now<00:06:54.490> you<00:06:54.550> see<00:06:54.820> some<00:06:54.940> expert<00:06:55.330> weaving

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
that now you see some expert weaving

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.900 
that now you see some expert weaving
here<00:06:55.840> now<00:06:56.470> I<00:06:56.830> should<00:06:57.250> just<00:06:57.370> say<00:06:57.520> that<00:06:57.729> we<00:06:57.880> are
