when we first in the light on don't be

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.860 
when we first in the light on don't be

of very dim in there

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.870 
of very dim in there
glowy<00:04:54.660> blue<00:04:55.170> light<00:04:55.410> isn't<00:04:55.710> like<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.400> should<00:04:56.790> be

glowy blue light isn't like it should be

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.420 
glowy blue light isn't like it should be
dark<00:04:57.470> because<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.530> think<00:04:58.770> they<00:04:58.950> use<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.160> light

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
dark because I think they use the light

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.470 
dark because I think they use the light
to<00:04:59.460> help<00:04:59.790> them<00:05:00.560> with<00:05:01.560> their<00:05:01.650> colors<00:05:03.800> yeah<00:05:05.420> so<00:05:06.420> I

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
to help them with their colors yeah so I

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.790 
to help them with their colors yeah so I

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800

think that basically covers everything
trying<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.400> think<00:05:08.550> I<00:05:08.640> have<00:05:08.730> everything<00:05:08.940> right

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240
