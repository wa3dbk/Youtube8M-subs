a<00:00:18.060> mess<00:00:18.540> oh<00:00:18.720> wiring<00:00:20.330> I'm<00:00:21.330> sure<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.960> there<00:00:22.110> are

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
a mess oh wiring I'm sure that there are

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.310 
a mess oh wiring I'm sure that there are
people<00:00:22.380> who<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.620> smarter<00:00:23.010> than<00:00:23.040> me<00:00:24.080> we<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.200> do

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
people who are smarter than me we can do

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.210 
people who are smarter than me we can do
this<00:00:25.470> quickly<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> fast<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:26.880> efficiently<00:00:28.220> me

this quickly and fast and efficiently me
I'm<00:00:29.370> doing<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.790> hard<00:00:29.970> way

power<00:00:44.460> steering<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.510> something

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
power steering I think is something

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:47.959 
power steering I think is something
after<00:00:46.559> exactly<00:00:47.249> what<00:00:47.429> it<00:00:47.489> stands<00:00:47.699> for<00:00:47.820> but

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
after exactly what it stands for but

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.149 
after exactly what it stands for but
either<00:00:48.269> way<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.739> sit<00:00:49.949> there<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
either way and you have to sit there and

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.790 
either way and you have to sit there and
label<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.730> wires<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.499> going

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800

if I need either these plugs

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.720 
if I need either these plugs
I<00:01:51.380> think<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> heater<00:01:53.280> blower<00:01:53.580> I

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
I think this is for the heater blower I

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.180 
I think this is for the heater blower I
forget<00:01:54.270> exactly<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:55.080> these<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:56.010> sit

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
forget exactly in these two I got to sit

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.710 
forget exactly in these two I got to sit
there<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.490> figure<00:01:56.820> out<00:01:56.880> open<00:01:57.330> them<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.510> and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
there and figure out open them up and

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.310 
there and figure out open them up and
take<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.080> look<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.440> see<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.680> they're<00:01:58.830> for<00:02:00.320> I'd

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
take a look and see what they're for I'd

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320 
take a look and see what they're for I'd
like<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> hope<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.220> not<00:02:02.400> have<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.730> use<00:02:02.880> any<00:02:03.180> of

Ford belt should because I know some of

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.379 
Ford belt should because I know some of
the<00:04:35.479> Fords<00:04:35.750> are<00:04:35.870> like<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> bitch<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.740> get<00:04:36.830> on<00:04:37.389> as

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
the Fords are like a bitch to get on as

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.060 
the Fords are like a bitch to get on as
mentioned<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.139> need<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.560> remove<00:04:39.800> your

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
mentioned you need to remove your

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.249 
mentioned you need to remove your
tensioner<00:04:40.780> anytime<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.900> want<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.080> change

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
tensioner anytime you want to change

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.870 
tensioner anytime you want to change
your<00:04:42.380> belt<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:42.800> if<00:04:43.070> your<00:04:43.190> belt<00:04:43.340> breaks<00:04:43.520> is

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
your belt so if your belt breaks is

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.580 
your belt so if your belt breaks is
behind<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.419> tensioner<00:04:44.810> there<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.110> no<00:04:45.259> option

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
behind the tensioner there is no option

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.590 
behind the tensioner there is no option
there<00:04:45.850> that's<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:47.030> big<00:04:47.180> deal

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
there that's a big deal

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.990 
there that's a big deal
you<00:04:47.990> also<00:04:48.199> removed<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.740> pulley<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.340> tried

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
you also removed this pulley I tried

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.550 
you also removed this pulley I tried
slop<00:04:50.330> in<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.539> pulleys<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.960> course<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.350> binds

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
slop in the pulleys of course it binds

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.860 
slop in the pulleys of course it binds
up<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.639> try<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:52.970> washer<00:04:53.419> out<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.660> pulley

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
up so you try and washer out the pulley

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.290 
up so you try and washer out the pulley
then<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:55.220> belt<00:04:55.400> doesn't<00:04:55.580> ride<00:04:55.789> on<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.120> pulley

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
then the belt doesn't ride on the pulley

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.210 
then the belt doesn't ride on the pulley
correctly<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.080> then<00:04:57.199> you<00:04:57.289> got<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.470> washer<00:04:57.949> at

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
correctly so then you got a washer at

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.420 
correctly so then you got a washer at
this<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.940> other<00:04:59.120> what<00:04:59.419> yeah<00:04:59.630> just<00:05:00.110> like<00:05:00.430> you

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
this the other what yeah just like you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.180 
this the other what yeah just like you
got<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.580> washer<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.180> out<00:05:02.620> your<00:05:03.620> your

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
got a washer this out your your

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.650 
got a washer this out your your
tensioner<00:05:04.669> out<00:05:04.849> but<00:05:05.120> there's<00:05:05.270> very<00:05:05.419> little

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
tensioner out but there's very little

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.339 
tensioner out but there's very little
thread<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.470> little<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:08.720> was<00:05:08.840> more

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
thread and a little it was more

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.170 
thread and a little it was more
hassle<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.860> put<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.669> just<00:05:10.880> left<00:05:11.060> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
hassle I put a I just left the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.460 
hassle I put a I just left the
smooth<00:05:11.389> belt<00:05:11.630> on<00:05:11.780> there<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.110> guess<00:05:12.229> what<00:05:12.380> it

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
smooth belt on there and guess what it

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.460 
smooth belt on there and guess what it
works<00:05:12.590> just<00:05:13.520> fine<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:14.690> ignore<00:05:15.199> people

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
works just fine so ignore people

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.040 
works just fine so ignore people
when<00:05:15.590> they<00:05:15.710> say<00:05:15.889> change<00:05:16.160> out<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.490> thing

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
when they say change out the thing

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.339 
when they say change out the thing
pushes<00:05:18.050> out<00:05:18.199> my<00:05:18.229> my<00:05:19.330> little<00:05:20.330> grooves<00:05:20.990> on<00:05:21.169> this

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
pushes out my my little grooves on this

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.080 
pushes out my my little grooves on this
well<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:21.770> whatever<00:05:22.190> I'll<00:05:22.460> buy<00:05:22.610> another<00:05:22.849> damn

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
well then whatever I'll buy another damn

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.170 
well then whatever I'll buy another damn
belt<00:05:23.360> sometime

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
belt sometime

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.210 
belt sometime
anyhow<00:05:26.180> that's<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.949> gist<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:28.610> this<00:05:28.849> so<00:05:29.750> 70<00:05:30.740> and

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
anyhow that's the gist of this so 70 and

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.820 
anyhow that's the gist of this so 70 and
a<00:05:31.280> half<00:05:31.310> inches<00:05:32.000> will<00:05:32.300> do<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:33.050> little<00:05:33.560> I

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
a half inches will do it a little I

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.320 
a half inches will do it a little I
bought<00:05:34.159> a<00:05:34.190> little<00:05:34.400> bit<00:05:34.580> shorter<00:05:35.000> because<00:05:35.120> they

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
bought a little bit shorter because they

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.560 
bought a little bit shorter because they
didn't<00:05:35.539> have<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.750> exact<00:05:36.139> length<00:05:36.409> and<00:05:37.570> well

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
didn't have the exact length and well

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.300 
didn't have the exact length and well
looky<00:05:38.990> there<00:05:39.020> that's<00:05:39.530> perfect

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
looky there that's perfect

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.960 
looky there that's perfect

else<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.840> really<00:06:03.320> don't<00:06:03.530> know<00:06:03.740> this<00:06:04.669> is<00:06:04.909> the

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
else I really don't know this is the

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.270 
else I really don't know this is the
problem<00:06:05.509> with<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:06.169> returned<00:06:06.530> list

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
problem with the returned list

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.990 
problem with the returned list
fuel<00:06:07.610> system<00:06:08.030> I<00:06:08.120> think<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:09.669> think<00:06:10.669> it's<00:06:10.820> this

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
fuel system I think I think it's this

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.520 
fuel system I think I think it's this
one<00:06:11.180> right<00:06:11.210> here<00:06:11.509> is<00:06:11.690> your<00:06:11.810> pressure<00:06:12.080> sensor

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
one right here is your pressure sensor

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.870 
one right here is your pressure sensor
how<00:06:12.740> much<00:06:12.919> pressure<00:06:13.250> you<00:06:13.490> have<00:06:13.789> in<00:06:14.449> there<00:06:14.810> oh

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
how much pressure you have in there oh

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.430 
how much pressure you have in there oh
boy<00:06:16.880> that's<00:06:17.330> why<00:06:17.599> you<00:06:17.659> got<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:17.870> have<00:06:18.020> a<00:06:18.050> return

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
boy that's why you got to have a return

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.129 
boy that's why you got to have a return
list<00:06:18.740> and<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.970> can<00:06:20.000> do<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.270> return<00:06:20.659> style<00:06:20.930> you

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
list and you can do a return style you

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.560 
list and you can do a return style you
can<00:06:21.259> convert<00:06:21.530> this<00:06:21.740> over<00:06:22.099> I<00:06:22.130> guess<00:06:22.430> just<00:06:23.330> by<00:06:23.539> a

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
can convert this over I guess just by a

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.870 
can convert this over I guess just by a
fitting<00:06:24.050> change<00:06:24.349> it<00:06:24.500> all<00:06:24.620> out<00:06:24.860> put<00:06:25.190> a<00:06:25.610> key<00:06:25.849> in

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
fitting change it all out put a key in

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.760 
fitting change it all out put a key in
there<00:06:26.210> something<00:06:26.599> like<00:06:26.690> that<00:06:26.840> put<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.020> fuel

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
there something like that put a fuel

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.129 
there something like that put a fuel
pressure<00:06:27.949> regulator<00:06:28.310> in<00:06:28.699> there<00:06:29.020> something<00:06:30.020> I

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
pressure regulator in there something I

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.689
