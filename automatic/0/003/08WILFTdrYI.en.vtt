00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.379
 It is the seed value of the pso version that is introduced in the video to crash it now 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 I will 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:22.960
 The main is that there are three villages and yeah it's a pyramid 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.939
 Since there was little variety in somewhere 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.529
 Such but it may not be the comparatively eventful Well side 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 It is a seed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.440
 Yes Dating So we will introduce a screenshot current table for each point after this 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 I do not want to see it 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.590
 After all who want to discover on your own whether this previously not it be better not to see if 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590
 think 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:00.010
 I'm spawning . Oh, so I do n't think that 's a bad view, so it 's good. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 think 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:09.490
 Though we introduce three villages from here 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.270
 As it is feeling that is between bag playing string playing 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.220
 Just that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.630
 Of these three villages after all map 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.860
 It feels like one on the right and one on the lower left and one on the lower right 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.840
 It will be difficult to connect a little bit 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:34.759
 Well Decide any one of the village because 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.179
 I think it feels like it's going to be a base , I feel a bit messy 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.179
 I will 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:49.500
 There is a warning just south of the grassland village I introduced to this third in Thailand 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 In the alert zombie sponnar yeah 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.290
 Clouds 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.490
 There is a spawner 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.000
 Though we introduce middle height of this treasure box though 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'm sorry I might not change this 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.550
 that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.590
 I haven't confirmed it, but that zombie's spawner is kinda 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.920
 I feel that there are various uses 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:20.300
 I Na Kumonosupo 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:25.910
 In fact what the question Tteyuu I would Do not use is the Hey item I'd I is 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.230
 Hard to make Well I etc. are what do you experience strap but there is to say Rutte got 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.500
 Right 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.500
 i 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.050
 Even closed schools 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.110
 I had it 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:43.640
 I'm lucky I'm actually only found this corner 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.930
 I tried digging, but maybe it might be buried somehow 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.930
 I do not understand for a moment 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.709
 Because here is exposed 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.709
 It was a diamond and it was like this. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:06.490
 There is g of the jungle there Well is it is normal that building pyramids from cat 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:14.290
 Why I love 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:15.130
 There was also a witch's house Oh this's this ps 4 But this fable tree building is a witch's house 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.320
 What 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.320
 Yes I could confirm 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:30.569
 The last thing to introduce is this underground warning 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:37.319
 There is a fine warning in the basement 8 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:39.629
 You do not be a little better search Well Tadeetto had become quite deep feeling 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.460
 But I but also I got to cash likely something 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.340
 so 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:51.510
 It is its entrance is another tremendous small that 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:56.530
 Though I'm hard to understand that it is a little image a bit of a hole in the cliff is Aiteite 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:01.720
 I feel that after Kunichika world has spread its 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:07.330
 It is in I was happy with what I adventurer that very 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.390
 By all means You everyone Nechotto I thought that I want to go to see this movement and underground world 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.390
 The 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.440
 It is this time 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:22.360
 After all, I think that Minecraft underground is not complete 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.510
 The topography of the basement will be in conflict with you 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:32.710
 No, you will admire it in that over true 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:35.250
 I think that it is a playable map because there are 3 villages and a warning is coming from the village. 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.250
 I 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.719
