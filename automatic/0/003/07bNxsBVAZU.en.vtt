bit<00:00:20.250> about<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> you'll<00:00:21.240> never<00:00:21.539> need<00:00:21.750> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
bit about it is you'll never need to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980 
bit about it is you'll never need to
visit<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> these<00:00:22.710> places<00:00:23.090> again

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
visit one of these places again

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.720 
visit one of these places again
okay<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.050> it's<00:00:27.560> going<00:00:27.710> Kevlar<00:00:28.220> belts<00:00:28.640> that

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
okay so it's going Kevlar belts that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.609 
okay so it's going Kevlar belts that
means<00:00:29.090> there's<00:00:29.240> no<00:00:29.300> chain<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.019> sprockets

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
means there's no chain and sprockets

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.639 
means there's no chain and sprockets
there's<00:00:31.400> no<00:00:31.880> spark<00:00:32.750> plugs<00:00:33.110> there's<00:00:33.470> no

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
there's no spark plugs there's no

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.680 
there's no spark plugs there's no
filters<00:00:34.460> there's<00:00:34.730> no<00:00:34.879> oil<00:00:35.210> there's<00:00:35.989> no<00:00:36.489> petrol

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
filters there's no oil there's no petrol

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.590 
filters there's no oil there's no petrol
so<00:00:38.690> there's<00:00:38.870> all<00:00:38.989> that<00:00:39.019> equate<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.470> no<00:00:39.890> fun

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
so there's all that equate to no fun

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:55.710 
so there's all that equate to no fun
let's<00:00:41.600> find<00:00:41.809> out

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.130

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
I have to be honest for someone who's

eight<00:01:01.390> this<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.080> really<00:01:02.560> weird<00:01:02.800> concept<00:01:03.190> it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
eight this is a really weird concept it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.760 
eight this is a really weird concept it
does<00:01:04.120> take<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.449> bit<00:01:04.660> to<00:01:04.720> get<00:01:04.960> past<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.410> whole<00:01:05.530> no

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
does take a bit to get past the whole no

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.400 
does take a bit to get past the whole no
noise<00:01:06.160> part<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.150> ride<00:01:07.300> it's<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:08.140> quite

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
noise part of the ride it's just quite

noise part of the ride it's just quite
eerie<00:01:08.680> as<00:01:08.980> a<00:01:09.040> biker<00:01:09.640> there's<00:01:09.910> something

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
eerie as a biker there's something

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.640 
eerie as a biker there's something
actually<00:01:10.240> quite<00:01:10.570> nice<00:01:10.750> about<00:01:11.050> known<00:01:11.320> as<00:01:11.530> an

actually quite nice about known as an

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.860 
actually quite nice about known as an
engine<00:01:12.040> between<00:01:12.400> your<00:01:12.550> legs<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:13.210> can<00:01:13.390> feel<00:01:13.720> it

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.030 
from work and you sat in traffic a lot
you'd<00:03:04.239> have<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.600> sit<00:03:04.780> there<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.019> we're<00:03:05.739> away

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you'd have to sit there and we're away

you'd have to sit there and we're away
your<00:03:06.280> brakes<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:07.150> know<00:03:07.209> if<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.390> turn<00:03:07.570> that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
your brakes you know if you turn that

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.930 
your brakes you know if you turn that
into<00:03:07.780> sport<00:03:08.080> mode<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.500> come<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.190> line<00:03:09.670> here

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
into sport mode I come to a line here

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.140 
into sport mode I come to a line here
it's<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:11.350> standard<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:12.070> guess<00:03:12.820> what<00:03:13.000> you'd

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it's your standard I guess what you'd

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.699 
it's your standard I guess what you'd
normally<00:03:13.180> expect<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.140> have<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.410> apply

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
normally expect and you have to apply

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.970 
normally expect and you have to apply
your<00:03:15.489> brakes<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.200> that's<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.470> quite<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.769> big

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
your brakes so that's a quite a big

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.729 
your brakes so that's a quite a big
difference<00:03:18.400> between<00:03:18.610> both<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.450> modes<00:03:19.810> eco

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
difference between both of the modes eco

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.690 
difference between both of the modes eco
in<00:03:20.920> sport<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:22.590> yeah<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> think<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:23.950> makes<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.250> big

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
in sport and yeah I think it makes a big

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.100 
in sport and yeah I think it makes a big
difference<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.299> kind<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.510> explains<00:03:25.870> why<00:03:26.080> I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
difference and it kind of explains why I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.479 
difference and it kind of explains why I
know<00:03:26.260> we<00:03:26.440> were<00:03:26.500> saying<00:03:26.739> about<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
know we were saying about the the

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.190 
know we were saying about the the
mileage<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.630> get<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.110> these

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
mileage that you can get out of these

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.470 
mileage that you can get out of these
you<00:03:29.440> know<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:29.620> you'll<00:03:29.799> sit<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.130> an<00:03:30.220> eco<00:03:30.549> there

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
you know if you'll sit in an eco there

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.000 
you know if you'll sit in an eco there
is<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.630> big<00:03:31.840> chance<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.290> could<00:03:32.410> put<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.920> know

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
is a big chance you could put you know

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.330 
is a big chance you could put you know
very<00:03:33.190> much<00:03:33.430> surpass<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.100> amount<00:03:36.280> of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
very much surpass the the the amount of

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.850 
very much surpass the the the amount of
my<00:03:36.549> did<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.820> could<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:37.150> had<00:03:37.720> heard<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.320> you
