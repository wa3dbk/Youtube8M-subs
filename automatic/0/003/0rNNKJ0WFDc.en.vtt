hi<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:01.020> iris<00:00:01.680> here<00:00:02.429> in<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.639> design

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hi this is iris here in the design

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi this is iris here in the design
center<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.080> wanted<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.529> show<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.830> how<00:00:05.700> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
center and I wanted to show you how to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.440 
center and I wanted to show you how to
put<00:00:06.060> two<00:00:06.270> sheets<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.109> clay<00:00:07.259> together<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
put two sheets of clay together and

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.509 
put two sheets of clay together and
avoid<00:00:09.450> air<00:00:09.809> bubbles<00:00:09.840> because<00:00:10.800> air<00:00:11.130> bubbles

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
avoid air bubbles because air bubbles

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.089 
avoid air bubbles because air bubbles
are<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:11.969> our<00:00:12.120> friend<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:13.019> always<00:00:13.590> easiest

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
are not our friend it's always easiest

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.400 
are not our friend it's always easiest
to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:14.969> thicker<00:00:15.299> pieces<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.170> clay

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to do it with thicker pieces of clay

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.730 
to do it with thicker pieces of clay
that<00:00:16.440> are<00:00:16.859> smaller<00:00:17.840> we'll<00:00:18.840> try<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.320> work<00:00:19.500> up

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that are smaller we'll try and work up

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.859 
that are smaller we'll try and work up
to<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.520> big<00:00:20.670> pieces<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.330> see<00:00:21.689> what

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to some really big pieces and see what

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.580 
to some really big pieces and see what
happens<00:00:22.199> there<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.570> put<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
happens there what I do is I put the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.120 
happens there what I do is I put the
piece<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> clay<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> top<00:00:26.910> piece<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> clay

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
piece of clay the top piece of clay

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.700 
piece of clay the top piece of clay
right<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> end<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.779> hold<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
right on the end and I hold up this the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
right on the end and I hold up this the
one<00:00:35.010> end<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> whether<00:00:35.880> you're<00:00:36.000> righty<00:00:36.270> or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
one end of it whether you're righty or

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920 
one end of it whether you're righty or
lefty<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.800> take<00:00:38.100> my<00:00:38.370> hand<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
lefty and then I take my hand and I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.970 
lefty and then I take my hand and I
guide<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.770> clay<00:00:41.100> down<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.440> Sheen<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> along

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
guide the clay down and Sheen it along

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.529 
guide the clay down and Sheen it along
to<00:00:44.640> avoid<00:00:45.000> any<00:00:45.480> air<00:00:45.870> getting<00:00:46.350> locked<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.890> there

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
to avoid any air getting locked in there

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.250 
to avoid any air getting locked in there
that<00:00:48.539> looks<00:00:48.690> pretty<00:00:48.899> good

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that looks pretty good

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.340 
that looks pretty good
then<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.770> take<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.600> acrylic<00:00:51.600> roller<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
then I just take my acrylic roller and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.939 
then I just take my acrylic roller and
go<00:00:52.770> over<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.870> that's<00:00:54.870> good<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
go over it so that's good to go so as I

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
go over it so that's good to go so as I
said<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.699> easier<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:58.199> are

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
said it's a little easier when there are

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.979 
said it's a little easier when there are
thicker<00:00:58.559> pieces<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.280> clay<00:00:59.719> now<00:01:00.719> I'm<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
thicker pieces of clay now I'm going to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.820 
thicker pieces of clay now I'm going to
try<00:01:01.260> thinner<00:01:01.949> pieces<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.640> clay<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
try thinner pieces of clay that are a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.030 
try thinner pieces of clay that are a
little<00:01:05.010> larger<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.619> rolled

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
little larger I think this was rolled

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.630 
little larger I think this was rolled
out<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.299> number<00:01:09.750> four<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.340> another

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
out on a number four and I have another

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.580 
out on a number four and I have another
one<00:01:11.850> afterwards<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.720> rolled<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
one afterwards that's rolled out on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
one afterwards that's rolled out on
number<00:01:14.340> six<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.750> same<00:01:16.049> method<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.720> put

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
number six I do the same method I put

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
number six I do the same method I put
the<00:01:18.840> clay<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.100> end<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.430> on

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the clay down on one end so it's on

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.410 
the clay down on one end so it's on
there<00:01:23.790> pretty<00:01:24.000> secure<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.000> keep<00:01:27.150> holding

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there pretty secure but I keep holding

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.469 
there pretty secure but I keep holding
this<00:01:27.780> end<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.340> start<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this end up if you start to do this and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.929 
this end up if you start to do this and
it's<00:01:30.780> crooked<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> crooked

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's crooked just go with the crooked

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.280 
it's crooked just go with the crooked
because<00:01:34.130> taking<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> apart<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:36.329> makes<00:01:36.630> four

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
because taking it apart just makes four

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.740 
because taking it apart just makes four
problems<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> am<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> rolling

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
problems so here I am I'm just rolling

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:49.679 
problems so here I am I'm just rolling
it<00:01:40.790> along<00:01:41.790> inching<00:01:42.630> along<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.380> hands

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.910 

okay<00:01:50.689> have<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.020> lot<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> fingerprints<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:51.890> I

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
okay have a lot of fingerprints but I

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.460 
okay have a lot of fingerprints but I
don't<00:01:52.130> think<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.340> have<00:01:52.460> any<00:01:52.640> air<00:01:52.820> bubbles<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.479> do

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
don't think I have any air bubbles I do

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.230 
don't think I have any air bubbles I do
have<00:01:54.770> some<00:01:54.920> air<00:01:55.130> bubbles<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:55.729> have<00:01:55.880> one<00:01:56.090> right

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
have some air bubbles I have one right

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.130 
have some air bubbles I have one right
there<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.810> if<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.500> just<00:01:57.740> work<00:01:58.009> toward<00:01:59.140> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
there and if you just work toward the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.320 
there and if you just work toward the
air<00:02:00.380> bubble<00:02:00.860> toward<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.369> edge<00:02:01.580> you<00:02:02.000> should<00:02:02.210> be

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
air bubble toward the edge you should be

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:14.229 
air bubble toward the edge you should be
able<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.659> get<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.960> out<00:02:03.310> there<00:02:04.310> we<00:02:04.430> go<00:02:13.030> okay<00:02:14.030> so

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
able to get it out there we go okay so

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.830 
able to get it out there we go okay so
that's<00:02:14.660> together<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.940> now<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.030> are<00:02:20.330> going<00:02:20.569> to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that's together and now we are going to

that's together and now we are going to
try<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:22.430> that's<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:23.120> large<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.930> largest<00:02:24.410> piece

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
try one that's a large the largest piece

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.820 
try one that's a large the largest piece
that<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:25.010> here<00:02:25.250> these<00:02:25.540> are<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.200> think

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
between a five and a six I'm sorry I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.449 
between a five and a six I'm sorry I
