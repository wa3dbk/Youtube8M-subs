cuts it doesn't rock quite so much I

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.070 
cuts it doesn't rock quite so much I
usually<00:01:05.620> brace<00:01:06.010> it<00:01:06.220> with<00:01:06.370> my<00:01:06.520> foot<00:01:06.790> but<00:01:07.750> just

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
usually brace it with my foot but just

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.620 
usually brace it with my foot but just
in<00:01:08.200> case<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.979> problem<00:01:09.370> with<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.640> saw<00:01:10.360> is

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
in case the problem with this saw is

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.190 
in case the problem with this saw is
that<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.170> got<00:01:11.380> some<00:01:12.150> non-standard<00:01:13.200> miter

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
that it's got some non-standard miter

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that it's got some non-standard miter
tracks<00:01:14.590> in<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.479> works<00:01:16.479> fine<00:01:16.810> for<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.260> miter

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
tracks in it works fine for the miter

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.320 
tracks in it works fine for the miter
that<00:01:18.520> they<00:01:18.670> give<00:01:18.880> you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
that they give you

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
that they give you
miter<00:01:19.840> gauge<00:01:20.080> that<00:01:20.380> comes<00:01:20.650> with<00:01:20.830> it<00:01:20.950> but<00:01:21.130> it's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
miter gauge that comes with it but it's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.969 
miter gauge that comes with it but it's
it's<00:01:23.710> too<00:01:23.890> small<00:01:24.420> most<00:01:25.560> industry<00:01:26.560> standard

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
it's too small most industry standard

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's too small most industry standard
would<00:01:27.159> be<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.750> 3/4<00:01:28.750> inch<00:01:28.900> wide<00:01:29.020> by<00:01:29.410> 3/8<00:01:29.920> inch

a dremel tool but I didn't feel like
doing<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.970> there's<00:01:43.570> several<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.590> them

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
doing that and there's several of them

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.610 
doing that and there's several of them
across<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.160> face<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.060> table<00:01:46.420> also<00:01:47.320> in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
this other miter track over here so

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.400 
this other miter track over here so
nothing<00:01:50.860> fits<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.960> craftsman<00:01:52.960> doesn't<00:01:53.260> even

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
nothing fits and craftsman doesn't even

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.310 
nothing fits and craftsman doesn't even
have<00:01:53.650> any<00:01:53.800> aftermarket<00:01:54.570> miter<00:01:55.570> gauges<00:01:56.140> or

would<00:01:58.240> fit<00:01:58.480> this<00:01:58.600> track<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.290> it's<00:02:00.160> very

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
would fit this track so it's very

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.680 
would fit this track so it's very
frustrating<00:02:00.610> I've<00:02:01.120> been<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.390> year's<00:02:01.660> a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
frustrating I've been this year's a

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.090 
frustrating I've been this year's a
bunch<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.050> times<00:02:02.290> looking<00:02:02.680> through<00:02:02.920> their

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
bunch of times looking through their

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.590 
bunch of times looking through their
stacks<00:02:03.430> trying<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.910> find<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.300> I've<00:02:04.390> been<00:02:04.510> on

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
stacks trying to find it I've been on

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.380 
stacks trying to find it I've been on
their<00:02:04.750> website<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.610> finally<00:02:06.610> decided<00:02:06.970> I'd<00:02:07.180> make

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
their website I finally decided I'd make

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.270 
their website I finally decided I'd make
my<00:02:07.600> own<00:02:07.780> crosscut<00:02:08.440> sled<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.599> what<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:10.989> did

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
my own crosscut sled and so what I did

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.650 
my own crosscut sled and so what I did
was<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.700> took<00:02:12.730> some<00:02:13.000> maple<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.739> ripped

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
was I took some maple and I ripped

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.729 
was I took some maple and I ripped
runners<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:18.569> run<00:02:19.569> along<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.870> outside<00:02:20.470> edge

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
runners that run along the outside edge

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.759 
runners that run along the outside edge
of<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.069> table<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.879> table<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.629> about<00:02:23.140> 26

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
of the table and the table is about 26

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.660 
of the table and the table is about 26
inches<00:02:23.920> wide<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:26.220> took<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.430> piece<00:02:27.640> of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
inches wide so I took a piece of

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.200 
inches wide so I took a piece of
melamine<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:31.650> sized<00:02:32.650> those<00:02:32.950> runners<00:02:33.250> with

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
melamine and I sized those runners with

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.360 
melamine and I sized those runners with
a<00:02:34.240> couple<00:02:34.600> extra<00:02:34.900> inches<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.440> spare<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.950> each

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
a couple extra inches to spare on each

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.589 
a couple extra inches to spare on each
side<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.150> saw

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
side of the saw

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.140 
side of the saw
so<00:02:38.079> I<00:02:38.109> could<00:02:38.379> see<00:02:38.590> them<00:02:38.769> when<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.519> go<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> put<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so I could see them when I go to put the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.789 
so I could see them when I go to put the
sled<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.689> saw<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.109> easier<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.469> line<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
sled on the saw it's easier to line it

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.479 
sled on the saw it's easier to line it
up<00:02:41.889> and<00:02:42.849> then<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:44.079> actually<00:02:44.620> took<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.189> existing

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
up and then I actually took the existing

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.660 
up and then I actually took the existing
miter<00:02:45.909> gauge<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.510> screwed<00:02:47.439> it<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.980> my<00:02:48.400> back

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
miter gauge and screwed it into my back

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.259 
miter gauge and screwed it into my back
of<00:02:48.849> my<00:02:48.939> fence<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.650> use<00:02:50.829> it<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.099> a<00:02:51.129> handle

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
of my fence just to use it as a handle

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.569 
of my fence just to use it as a handle
it<00:02:52.510> helps<00:02:52.900> when<00:02:53.109> doing<00:02:53.499> really<00:02:53.859> tough<00:02:54.250> cuts

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
it helps when doing really tough cuts

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.890 
it helps when doing really tough cuts
like<00:02:55.510> two<00:02:55.719> by<00:02:55.900> fours<00:02:56.230> or<00:02:56.530> four<00:02:57.159> by<00:02:57.280> fours<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.909> to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
like two by fours or four by fours to to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.240 
like two by fours or four by fours to to
be<00:02:58.989> able<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.230> push<00:02:59.439> from<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> bottom<00:02:59.920> and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
be able to push from the bottom and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.309 
be able to push from the bottom and
really<00:03:00.489> put<00:03:00.670> your<00:03:00.790> weight<00:03:00.969> on<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
really put your weight on it

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.050 
really put your weight on it
so<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:03.459> handle<00:03:03.819> helps<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.689> this<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.469> my

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
so the handle helps and this is my

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.740 
so the handle helps and this is my
safety<00:03:07.439> block<00:03:08.489> basically<00:03:09.489> my<00:03:09.939> my<00:03:10.329> saw<00:03:10.569> blade

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
safety block basically my my saw blade

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.429 
safety block basically my my saw blade
is<00:03:11.019> right<00:03:11.200> here<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.609> it<00:03:12.760> goes<00:03:12.939> into<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.569> the

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
is right here and it goes into the the

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.149 
is right here and it goes into the the
face<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.760> will<00:03:15.909> go<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.659> few<00:03:17.439> inches<00:03:17.650> into

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
face and it will go in a few inches into

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.439 
face and it will go in a few inches into
this<00:03:19.560> double<00:03:20.560> two<00:03:20.919> by<00:03:21.099> fours<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:22.000> that's<00:03:22.209> a

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
this double two by fours so that's a

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.750 
this double two by fours so that's a
three<00:03:22.840> inches<00:03:23.199> right<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.040> here's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
three inches right here and here's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.349 
three inches right here and here's
another<00:03:24.879> inch<00:03:25.419> and<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.689> half<00:03:25.719> here<00:03:27.180> well<00:03:28.180> what<00:03:28.299> I

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
another inch and a half here well what I

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.929 
another inch and a half here well what I
did<00:03:28.599> was<00:03:28.629> I<00:03:28.870> marked<00:03:29.230> on<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.219> top<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.699> table

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
did was I marked on the top of the table

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.709 
did was I marked on the top of the table
with<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.239> sharpie<00:03:31.689> this<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.799> where<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.879> I've

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 
with a sharpie this is where I I've

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.189 
with a sharpie this is where I I've
reached<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.379> full<00:03:35.620> cut<00:03:35.980> on<00:03:36.189> a<00:03:36.250> 2x4<00:03:37.090> which<00:03:38.049> is

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
reached a full cut on a 2x4 which is

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.509 
reached a full cut on a 2x4 which is
about<00:03:38.469> the<00:03:38.650> thickest<00:03:39.010> thing<00:03:39.189> that<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.489> ever

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
about the thickest thing that I ever

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.969 
about the thickest thing that I ever
really<00:03:39.849> cut<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.299> this<00:03:40.480> anyway<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:41.739> don't

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979 
really cut on this anyway so I don't

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.530 
really cut on this anyway so I don't
really<00:03:42.280> have<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.669> go<00:03:42.790> any<00:03:42.939> farther<00:03:43.209> than<00:03:43.449> that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
really have to go any farther than that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.270 
really have to go any farther than that
I<00:03:43.659> can<00:03:43.930> go<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.079> little<00:03:44.259> past<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.859> before<00:03:45.159> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
I can go a little past it before the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.830 
I can go a little past it before the
stop<00:03:45.519> block<00:03:45.699> hits<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.299> saw<00:03:47.019> blade<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.750> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
stop block hits the saw blade but that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.089 
stop block hits the saw blade but that
make<00:03:50.019> sure<00:03:50.229> that<00:03:50.379> I'm<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:50.620> going<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.799> cut<00:03:50.979> my

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
make sure that I'm not going to cut my

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.580 
make sure that I'm not going to cut my
fingers<00:03:51.430> off<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:52.120> keeps<00:03:52.419> my<00:03:52.629> hands<00:03:52.989> way<00:03:53.229> away

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
fingers off and keeps my hands way away

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.149

from<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.009> spinning<00:03:55.000> blade<00:03:55.319> next<00:03:56.319> step<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.919> to

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
from the spinning blade next step is to

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.960 
from the spinning blade next step is to
get<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.310> piece<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:57.879> acrylic<00:03:58.409> or<00:03:59.409> lexan<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:00.639> put

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
get a piece of acrylic or lexan and put

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.300 
get a piece of acrylic or lexan and put
it<00:04:01.060> across<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.599> top<00:04:01.840> from<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.680> side<00:04:02.949> to<00:04:03.280> that

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.249 
that up on that side I don't know I
think<00:04:18.849> I'll<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.120> put<00:04:19.449> a<00:04:19.479> clear<00:04:20.049> piece<00:04:20.229> of

think I'll just put a clear piece of

and<00:04:50.630> now<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.660> can<00:04:52.020> add<00:04:54.080> other<00:04:55.080> jigs<00:04:55.560> or<00:04:55.830> stops

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
and now I can add other jigs or stops

repeatable<00:05:03.600> cuts<00:05:04.400> now<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.460> also<00:05:05.910> have<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.420> same

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
repeatable cuts now I also have the same

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.930 
repeatable cuts now I also have the same
type<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:07.200> fence<00:05:07.440> but<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:07.830> only<00:05:08.010> 3/4<00:05:08.730> inch

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
type of fence but it's only 3/4 inch

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.370 
type of fence but it's only 3/4 inch
thick<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.330> didn't<00:05:09.600> see<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.840> need<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.020> make<00:05:10.260> it

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
thick I didn't see the need to make it

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.830 
thick I didn't see the need to make it
any<00:05:10.500> heavier<00:05:10.920> than<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.220> already<00:05:11.340> is<00:05:11.720> put<00:05:12.720> the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
any heavier than it already is put the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.730 
any heavier than it already is put the
same<00:05:13.080> dado<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.940> this<00:05:15.270> piece<00:05:15.540> this<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.870> only<00:05:16.110> 36

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
same dado in this piece this is only 36

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.540 
same dado in this piece this is only 36
inches<00:05:16.860> wide

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
inches wide

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.740 
inches wide
this<00:05:18.510> one<00:05:18.720> is<00:05:18.810> 48<00:05:19.380> inches<00:05:20.190> wide<00:05:20.600> just<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:21.690> I

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
this one is 48 inches wide just so I

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.560 
this one is 48 inches wide just so I
have<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.930> really<00:05:22.140> good<00:05:22.610> platform<00:05:23.610> for<00:05:23.970> cutting

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
have a really good platform for cutting

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.850 
have a really good platform for cutting
2x4<00:05:25.290> isn't<00:05:25.560> longer<00:05:25.950> longer<00:05:26.880> stock<00:05:27.710> which<00:05:28.710> has

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
2x4 isn't longer longer stock which has

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.160 
2x4 isn't longer longer stock which has
always<00:05:29.010> been<00:05:29.220> a<00:05:29.280> problem<00:05:29.460> on<00:05:29.760> this<00:05:29.880> air<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:30.870> I

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
always been a problem on this air so I

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.400 
always been a problem on this air so I
think<00:05:32.040> I'm<00:05:32.820> gonna<00:05:33.000> get<00:05:33.210> much<00:05:33.420> better<00:05:33.630> cuts<00:05:34.020> now

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
think I'm gonna get much better cuts now

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.070 
think I'm gonna get much better cuts now
I've<00:05:35.040> also<00:05:35.280> got<00:05:35.700> pretty<00:05:36.060> close<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.600> a<00:05:36.630> zero

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
I've also got pretty close to a zero

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.030 
I've also got pretty close to a zero
clearance<00:05:38.270> top<00:05:39.860> which<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:41.070> a<00:05:41.690> big<00:05:42.690> improvement

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
clearance top which is a big improvement

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.860 
clearance top which is a big improvement
so<00:05:44.300> now<00:05:45.300> I<00:05:45.330> can<00:05:45.630> actually<00:05:45.780> make<00:05:46.670> precision

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
so now I can actually make precision

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.440 
so now I can actually make precision
cuts<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.550> hopefully<00:05:50.550> everything<00:05:50.850> I<00:05:51.120> make<00:05:51.300> will

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
cuts so hopefully everything I make will

00:05:51.450 --> 00:06:15.810 
cuts so hopefully everything I make will
improve<00:05:51.780> now

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.880
