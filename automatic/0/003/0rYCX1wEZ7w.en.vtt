what<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.260> cloud9<00:03:23.440> competition<00:03:23.950> was<00:03:24.040> built<00:03:24.250> to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
what the cloud9 competition was built to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.460 
what the cloud9 competition was built to
do<00:03:24.550> it's<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.420> harder<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:25.960> do<00:03:26.170> when<00:03:26.350> they're

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
do it's just harder to do when they're

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.470 
do it's just harder to do when they're
down<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:26.890> far<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:27.760> kind<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.090> even<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.330> game

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
down so far they kind of even the game

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.020 
down so far they kind of even the game
up<00:03:28.630> with<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.900> fight<00:03:29.110> they<00:03:30.070> said<00:03:30.340> even<00:03:30.790> if

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
up with that fight they said even if

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.210 
up with that fight they said even if
cloud<00:03:31.270> 9<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.660> behind<00:03:31.930> they<00:03:32.260> go<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> hundred<00:03:32.830> per

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
cloud 9 is behind they go a hundred per

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.890 
cloud 9 is behind they go a hundred per
second<00:03:33.580> as<00:03:33.730> reward<00:03:34.210> and<00:03:34.420> now<00:03:34.570> we<00:03:34.630> need<00:03:34.810> to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
second as reward and now we need to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.690 
second as reward and now we need to
rotate<00:03:35.110> minute<00:03:35.620> maybe<00:03:35.830> even<00:03:36.130> find<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.430> fight<00:03:36.610> if

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
rotate minute maybe even find a fight if

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.580
