think i can do you'll be able to do that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.450 
think i can do you'll be able to do that
but<00:00:59.750> one<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.110> fears<00:01:00.380> is<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.130> kind<00:01:01.399> of

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
but one of the fears is and it kind of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.090 
but one of the fears is and it kind of
ties<00:01:01.670> into<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:02.380> environmental<00:01:03.380> all<00:01:03.890> these

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
ties into this environmental all these

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.530 
ties into this environmental all these
environmental<00:01:04.519> issues<00:01:04.969> that<00:01:05.149> people<00:01:05.269> are

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
environmental issues that people are

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.130 
environmental issues that people are
really<00:01:05.750> attuned<00:01:06.469> to<00:01:06.710> around<00:01:07.009> Earth<00:01:07.189> Day<00:01:07.460> is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
really attuned to around Earth Day is

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.660 
really attuned to around Earth Day is
people<00:01:09.140> can<00:01:09.259> throw<00:01:09.439> away<00:01:09.710> all<00:01:09.920> these<00:01:10.039> old<00:01:10.219> TVs

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
people can throw away all these old TVs

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.039 
people can throw away all these old TVs
well<00:01:10.880> our<00:01:10.999> research<00:01:11.329> shows<00:01:11.359> that<00:01:11.600> that's<00:01:11.869> not

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
well our research shows that that's not

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.209 
well our research shows that that's not
going<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.259> happen<00:01:12.350> for<00:01:12.679> a<00:01:12.740> couple<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.069> reasons

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
going to happen for a couple of reasons

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.209 
going to happen for a couple of reasons
first<00:01:14.179> of<00:01:14.299> all<00:01:14.479> some<00:01:15.380> people<00:01:15.679> will<00:01:15.829> just<00:01:16.039> get

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
first of all some people will just get

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.590 
first of all some people will just get
one<00:01:16.399> of<00:01:16.459> these<00:01:16.520> converter<00:01:16.880> boxes<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.420> still

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
one of these converter boxes and still

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.870 
one of these converter boxes and still
use<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.959> TV<00:01:18.170> okay<00:01:18.770> other<00:01:19.189> people<00:01:19.579> will<00:01:19.639> take

videotape<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.889> visto<00:01:25.729> que<00:01:25.939> no<00:01:26.179> DVD<00:01:26.630> so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
videotape so the visto que no DVD so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.379 
videotape so the visto que no DVD so
it's<00:01:26.959> still<00:01:27.139> usable<00:01:27.499> the<00:01:28.159> other<00:01:28.700> people<00:01:29.149> will

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
it's still usable the other people will

it's still usable the other people will
actually<00:01:29.689> recycle<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.709> but<00:01:30.920> that's<00:01:31.130> one<00:01:31.340> of

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
actually recycle it but that's one of

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.399 
actually recycle it but that's one of
the<00:01:31.609> things<00:01:31.639> that<00:01:31.999> we're<00:01:32.420> encouraging

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
the things that we're encouraging

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.589 
the things that we're encouraging
because<00:01:33.889> we<00:01:34.249> find<00:01:34.549> in<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:34.939> research<00:01:35.329> that

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
because we find in the research that

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:36.969 
because we find in the research that
seventy-five<00:01:36.079> percent<00:01:36.319> of<00:01:36.529> people<00:01:36.679> say<00:01:36.950> oh

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
seventy-five percent of people say oh

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.609 
seventy-five percent of people say oh
yeah<00:01:37.279> I<00:01:37.310> definitely<00:01:37.459> recycle<00:01:38.389> it<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:38.990> that

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
yeah I definitely recycle it but that

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.529 
yeah I definitely recycle it but that
same<00:01:39.889> amount<00:01:40.219> of<00:01:40.249> people<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:40.819> no<00:01:40.969> idea<00:01:40.999> how

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
same amount of people have no idea how

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.080 
same amount of people have no idea how
to<00:01:41.569> recycle<00:01:42.109> there's<00:01:42.529> their<00:01:42.709> bad<00:01:42.950> stuff<00:01:43.429> in<00:01:43.700> TV
