00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
I'm gonna teach you a little trick on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.119 
I'm gonna teach you a little trick on
how<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> use<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
how to use it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
how to use it
you<00:00:38.579> don't<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> pour<00:00:39.120> too<00:00:39.180> much<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.930> there

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you don't want to pour too much in there

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.630 
you don't want to pour too much in there
cuz<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:40.680> you're<00:00:40.770> gonna<00:00:40.890> end<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.370> big

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
cuz then you're gonna end up with a big

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
cuz then you're gonna end up with a big
glob<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.329> when<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> first<00:00:43.440> start<00:00:43.590> off

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
glob and when you first start off

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.290 
glob and when you first start off
working<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.180> you're<00:00:45.270> not

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
working and I see that you're not

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
working and I see that you're not
putting<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.899> over<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.860> not

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
putting it all over it I'm not

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.340 
putting it all over it I'm not
it<00:00:47.610> usually<00:00:47.910> recommends<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it usually recommends to do that and you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.540 
it usually recommends to do that and you
want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> do<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.039> gonna<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
want to do that if it's gonna be for a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
want to do that if it's gonna be for a
more<00:00:50.789> heavier<00:00:51.210> ombre<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.559> this

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
more heavier ombre look but this this

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.529 
more heavier ombre look but this this
we're<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> more<00:00:53.850> sunkissed<00:00:54.360> look

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we're going with a more sunkissed look

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
we're going with a more sunkissed look
so<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.469> more<00:00:55.620> towards<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so you want to put it more towards the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
so you want to put it more towards the
end<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.489> you'll<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:57.000> bit

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
end because you'll have a little bit

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.400 
end because you'll have a little bit
more<00:00:57.239> control<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.809> product<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.320> I'm

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
more control over the product so I'm

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.979 
more control over the product so I'm
taking<00:00:58.590> two<00:00:59.160> inch<00:00:59.430> subsections<00:01:00.300> okay

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
taking two inch subsections okay

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
taking two inch subsections okay
bringing<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> hair<00:01:01.649> forward<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> start

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
bringing the hair forward so you start

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
bringing the hair forward so you start
off<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.629> lightly<00:01:04.189> applying<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
off with very lightly applying at the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
off with very lightly applying at the
root<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.479> fine<00:01:06.810> line<00:01:07.189> working<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
root a very fine line working to a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
root a very fine line working to a
thicker<00:01:08.970> line<00:01:09.240> towards<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> ends<00:01:10.229> okay<00:01:10.590> okay

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
thicker line towards the ends okay okay

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.620 
thicker line towards the ends okay okay
and<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.490> you're<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.729> even<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and so you're not even going up to the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.109 
and so you're not even going up to the
top<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:14.010> maybe<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.790> third

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
top you're just going maybe like a third

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
top you're just going maybe like a third
of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.720> exactly<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> make
