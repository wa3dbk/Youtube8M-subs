herbal tea which was jasmine tea so it's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.179 
herbal tea which was jasmine tea so it's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
originally like a Chinese tea and I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.099 
originally like a Chinese tea and I
first<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> when<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:30.109> Chinese
