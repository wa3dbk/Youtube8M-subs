Windows machines anyway Gabe Newell has

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.180 
Windows machines anyway Gabe Newell has
said<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> state<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.510> windows<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.710> need

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
said that the state of windows is a need

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
said that the state of windows is a need
for<00:00:35.550> something<00:00:36.059> new<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.590> wanted<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
for something new and so they wanted a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
for something new and so they wanted a
new<00:00:38.010> platform<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.879> chose<00:00:39.059> linux<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
new platform and they chose linux and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
new platform and they chose linux and
that's<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.850> going

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that's what we have here and I'm going

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's what we have here and I'm going
to<00:00:42.030> go<00:00:42.180> ahead<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> log<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> yeah<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to go ahead and log in and yeah so this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
to go ahead and log in and yeah so this
is<00:00:49.680> steam<00:00:49.950> OS<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.520> running<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
is steam OS which I'm running in a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
is steam OS which I'm running in a
virtual<00:00:51.270> machine<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:52.250> really<00:00:53.250> wanted<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
virtual machine I really wanted to get a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.049 
virtual machine I really wanted to get a
guest<00:00:53.879> 1080p<00:00:54.420> video<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
guest 1080p video but I don't know the

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
guest 1080p video but I don't know the
resolution<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.090> being<00:00:57.420> weird<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.379> can

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
resolution is being weird I see if I can

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.479 
resolution is being weird I see if I can
change<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.180> but<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> CMOS<00:01:00.989> arm<00:01:01.489> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
change it here but this is CMOS arm it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.890 
change it here but this is CMOS arm it's
based<00:01:02.969> off<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.210> Debian<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.400> pretty<00:01:05.400> cool<00:01:05.900> I'm

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
based off of Debian it's pretty cool I'm

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.800 
based off of Debian it's pretty cool I'm
pretty<00:01:07.170> happy<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> yeah<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.430> go

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
pretty happy with it yeah here we go

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.340 
pretty happy with it yeah here we go
1920<00:01:09.810> x<00:01:09.930> 1080<00:01:10.140> p<00:01:10.590> keep<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.189> configuration

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
1920 x 1080 p keep this configuration

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.270 
1920 x 1080 p keep this configuration
yeah<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.590> you're<00:01:13.740> getting<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> little

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
yeah so you're getting to see a little

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
yeah so you're getting to see a little
bit<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.150> interface<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.780> they're<00:01:16.380> using

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
bit of the interface here they're using

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.749 
bit of the interface here they're using
um<00:01:17.570> they're<00:01:18.570> using<00:01:18.990> known<00:01:19.439> classic<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.490> their

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
um they're using known classic as their

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.499 
um they're using known classic as their
desktop<00:01:21.210> environment<00:01:21.720> choice<00:01:21.869> um<00:01:23.330> let's<00:01:24.330> see

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
desktop environment choice um let's see

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
desktop environment choice um let's see
a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.470> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a little bit over here it's really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.580 
a little bit over here it's really
really<00:01:26.189> snappy<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:27.119> simple<00:01:27.390> maybe<00:01:28.290> not

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
really snappy it's very simple maybe not

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.520 
really snappy it's very simple maybe not
as<00:01:28.860> flashy<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.880> Windows<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
as flashy as I Windows but the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.679 
as flashy as I Windows but the
simplicity<00:01:32.159> means<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.729> using<00:01:33.030> very

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
simplicity means that it's using very

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.840 
simplicity means that it's using very
few<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> system<00:01:34.740> resources<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
few of the system resources now this is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.100 
few of the system resources now this is
a<00:01:35.880> virtual<00:01:36.270> machine<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.780> still<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a virtual machine but I'm still going to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.539 
a virtual machine but I'm still going to
pull<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> system<00:01:37.619> monitor<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.220> show<00:01:38.400> this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
pull up the system monitor and show this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.840 
pull up the system monitor and show this
to<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:40.950> small<00:01:41.400> system

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
to you and the very small system

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.289 
to you and the very small system
resources<00:01:43.490> are<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.850> allow<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> play

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
resources are going to allow you to play

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.380 
resources are going to allow you to play
your<00:01:45.329> games<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.000> much<00:01:48.149> better

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
your games all with so much better

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
your games all with so much better
performance<00:01:48.869> from<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> same<00:01:49.229> hardware<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
performance from the same hardware and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.789 
performance from the same hardware and
that's<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.790> big<00:01:51.210> deal<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> saw<00:01:52.590> there's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
that's a big deal now you saw there's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.230 
that's a big deal now you saw there's
little<00:01:53.070> bug<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.399> didn't<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> start<00:01:54.090> up

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
little bug there didn't want to start up

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.500 
little bug there didn't want to start up
and<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:55.170> around

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
you can see my CPU resources here i'm

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.460 
you can see my CPU resources here i'm
using<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.760> nothing<00:02:07.210> just<00:02:07.960> absolutely

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
using like nothing just absolutely

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.590 
using like nothing just absolutely
nothing<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.729> see<00:02:09.880> all<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.180> my<00:02:10.330> course

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
nothing but you see all for my course

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.150 
nothing but you see all for my course
it's<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:11.050> it's<00:02:11.230> running<00:02:11.530> really<00:02:11.830> really

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
it's just it's running really really

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's just it's running really really
really<00:02:12.460> well<00:02:12.700> um<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.320> i'm<00:02:17.890> using<00:02:18.130> AMD

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
really well um but so i'm using AMD

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.010 
really well um but so i'm using AMD
hardware<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.540> brings<00:02:19.690> up<00:02:19.900> an

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
hardware and that brings up an

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.180 
hardware and that brings up an
interesting<00:02:20.080> point<00:02:20.490> currently<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.190> video

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
interesting point currently and video

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.440

hardware<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.610> all<00:02:24.730> that's<00:02:24.880> actually

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
hardware is all that's actually

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.970 
hardware is all that's actually
supported<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> system<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.680> install

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
supported in the system so to install

supported in the system so to install
this<00:02:27.370> i<00:02:27.580> had<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.850> jump<00:02:28.060> through<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.270> few<00:02:28.300> hoops

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
this i had to jump through a few hoops

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.460 
this i had to jump through a few hoops

wasn't<00:02:36.040> such<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> huge<00:02:36.850> deal<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.390> might<00:02:37.780> be

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
wasn't such a huge deal but might be

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.700 
wasn't such a huge deal but might be
intimidating<00:02:38.530> um<00:02:40.350> valve<00:02:41.350> has<00:02:41.500> said<00:02:41.650> that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
intimidating um valve has said that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.840 
intimidating um valve has said that
they're<00:02:41.860> going<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.040> support<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.490> lot<00:02:42.730> of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
they're going to support a lot of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.630 
they're going to support a lot of
hardware<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.930> i<00:02:44.500> hope<00:02:44.590> that's<00:02:44.800> true<00:02:44.890> i<00:02:45.250> want

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
hardware and i hope that's true i want

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.040 
hardware and i hope that's true i want
to<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.880> lot<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.030> AMD<00:02:46.420> support<00:02:46.750> i<00:02:46.780> think

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
to see a lot of AMD support i think

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.170 
to see a lot of AMD support i think
that's<00:02:47.200> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.500> happen<00:02:47.650> for<00:02:48.010> sure<00:02:48.160> what<00:02:49.090> I'm

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that's going to happen for sure what I'm

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.940 
that's going to happen for sure what I'm
a<00:02:49.240> little<00:02:49.420> concerned<00:02:49.570> with<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.170> some<00:02:50.680> older

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
a little concerned with is some older

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.290 
a little concerned with is some older
hardware<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.340> really<00:02:51.670> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.820> see<00:02:51.910> support

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
hardware I really want to see support

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.910 
hardware I really want to see support
for<00:02:52.480> some<00:02:52.600> older<00:02:52.840> hardware<00:02:53.020> older<00:02:53.530> GPU<00:02:53.890> is

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
for some older hardware older GPU is

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.010 
for some older hardware older GPU is
that<00:02:54.130> maybe<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.660> your<00:02:55.810> closet

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
that maybe you have in your closet

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.960 
that maybe you have in your closet
somewhere<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.370> want<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> build<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.790> steam

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
somewhere if you want to build a steam

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.940 
somewhere if you want to build a steam
machine<00:02:58.270> when<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.930> not<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.500> beta<00:02:59.739> anymore

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
machine when this is not in beta anymore

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.300 
machine when this is not in beta anymore
and<00:03:00.370> it's<00:03:00.730> probably<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.330> usable<00:03:01.690> platform<00:03:02.310> if

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
and it's probably a usable platform if

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.190 
and it's probably a usable platform if
you<00:03:04.030> want<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.300> stream<00:03:04.510> your<00:03:04.540> games<00:03:04.900> from<00:03:05.050> your

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
you want to stream your games from your

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.390 
you want to stream your games from your
main<00:03:05.350> tower<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.800> play<00:03:05.950> them<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.130> your<00:03:06.280> TV

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
main tower to play them on your TV

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400 
main tower to play them on your TV
that's<00:03:07.120> something<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.540> interests<00:03:07.989> me<00:03:08.080> and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
that's something that interests me and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.690 
that's something that interests me and
so<00:03:09.310> I'm<00:03:09.670> really<00:03:10.540> hoping<00:03:11.200> for<00:03:11.410> that<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.920> we'll

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
so I'm really hoping for that and we'll

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.550 
so I'm really hoping for that and we'll
see<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.570> case<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.230> don't

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
see you if that's the case and I don't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.620 
see you if that's the case and I don't
know<00:03:14.620> um<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.880> know<00:03:15.940> I'll<00:03:16.060> see<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.360> Steam

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
know um you know I'll see my Steam

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.350 
know um you know I'll see my Steam
library<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.350> can<00:03:17.470> get<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.739> open

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
library here if I can get it to open

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.670 
library here if I can get it to open
again<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> little<00:03:19.959> bit<00:03:20.080> buggy<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.440> might

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
again this is a little bit buggy I might

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.440 
again this is a little bit buggy I might
have<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.920> open<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.220> from<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.459> terminal<00:03:21.640> there<00:03:22.360> it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
have to open it from a terminal there it

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.380 
have to open it from a terminal there it
goes<00:03:22.650> um

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.140 

yeah<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:29.690> um<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:30.440> is<00:03:30.590> steamos<00:03:31.120> currently<00:03:32.120> I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
yeah so um this is steamos currently I

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.760 
yeah so um this is steamos currently I
really<00:03:32.510> feel<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:32.990> just<00:03:33.200> debian<00:03:33.590> with

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
really feel that it's just debian with

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.180 
really feel that it's just debian with
steam<00:03:33.980> installed<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:36.050> it's<00:03:36.470> truly<00:03:36.740> steamos

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
steam installed but it's truly steamos

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.050 
steam installed but it's truly steamos
um<00:03:38.770> sure<00:03:39.770> I<00:03:39.800> can<00:03:40.130> do<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:40.670> I'll<00:03:40.790> do<00:03:40.910> that

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
um sure I can do that but I'll do that

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.080 
um sure I can do that but I'll do that
later<00:03:41.120> get<00:03:41.960> that<00:03:42.080> out<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.380> way<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.000> here<00:03:44.000> we

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
later get that out of the way so here we

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.300 
later get that out of the way so here we

can<00:03:56.120> show<00:03:56.270> that<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.720> here<00:03:58.300> so<00:03:59.300> here<00:03:59.420> we<00:03:59.450> go

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
can show that to you here so here we go

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.020 
can show that to you here so here we go
we're<00:03:59.810> loading<00:04:00.110> big<00:04:00.260> picture<00:04:00.850> sorry<00:04:01.850> it's<00:04:01.970> a

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
we're loading big picture sorry it's a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.460 
we're loading big picture sorry it's a
little<00:04:02.060> laggy<00:04:02.390> I'm<00:04:02.690> running<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:02.990> in<00:04:03.110> a<00:04:03.170> virtual

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
little laggy I'm running it in a virtual

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.470 
little laggy I'm running it in a virtual
machine<00:04:03.500> again<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.880> probably<00:04:05.090> all<00:04:05.390> have

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
machine again and you probably all have

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.300 
machine again and you probably all have
seen<00:04:05.690> big<00:04:05.900> picture<00:04:06.230> before<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.710> this<00:04:06.920> is<00:04:06.980> what

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
seen big picture before and this is what

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.610 
seen big picture before and this is what
they<00:04:07.460> want<00:04:07.670> this<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:08.480> what<00:04:08.750> they<00:04:08.960> want<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.410> come

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
they want this is what they want to come

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.170 
they want this is what they want to come
up<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:09.920> your<00:04:09.950> screen<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.790> think<00:04:11.000> that's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
up on your screen and I think that's

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.520 
up on your screen and I think that's
cool<00:04:11.450> um<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:14.570> could<00:04:14.810> make<00:04:14.990> this<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.170> console

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
cool um this could make this a console

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.940 
cool um this could make this a console
killer<00:04:15.710> um<00:04:17.140> currently<00:04:18.140> as<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.380> sits<00:04:18.560> right<00:04:18.680> now

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
killer um currently as it sits right now

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.920 
killer um currently as it sits right now
though<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.430> don't<00:04:19.820> think<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.330> stands<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.900> chance

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
though I don't think it stands a chance

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.890 
though I don't think it stands a chance
on<00:04:21.530> earth<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.460> being<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.060> console<00:04:23.390> killer<00:04:23.540> but

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
on earth of being a console killer but

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.590 
on earth of being a console killer but
i'm<00:04:24.590> thinking<00:04:25.130> maybe<00:04:25.280> Val<00:04:25.610> has<00:04:25.850> some<00:04:26.300> plans

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
i'm thinking maybe Val has some plans

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.410 
i'm thinking maybe Val has some plans
and<00:04:27.590> I'm<00:04:27.800> gonna<00:04:27.980> tell<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.370> about<00:04:28.940> what<00:04:29.390> I

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
and I'm gonna tell you about what I

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.980 
and I'm gonna tell you about what I
think<00:04:29.540> you<00:04:29.840> maybe<00:04:30.110> should<00:04:30.230> do<00:04:31.540> um<00:04:32.540> because

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
think you maybe should do um because

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.600 
think you maybe should do um because
this<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.320> what<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.440> think<00:04:33.850> um<00:04:36.490> support<00:04:37.490> more

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
this is what I think um support more

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.910 
this is what I think um support more
hardware<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:38.060> already<00:04:38.270> mentioned<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.780> um<00:04:39.170> get

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
hardware I already mentioned that um get

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.500 
hardware I already mentioned that um get
your<00:04:40.040> manufacturer<00:04:40.700> partners<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.300> stop

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
your manufacturer partners to stop

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.140 
your manufacturer partners to stop
jumping<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.960> gun<00:04:42.080> like<00:04:42.320> alien<00:04:42.710> where<00:04:42.830> did

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
jumping the gun like alien where did

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.550 
jumping the gun like alien where did
that<00:04:44.150> thing<00:04:44.210> they<00:04:44.540> released<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:45.200> really

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
that thing they released is not really

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.350 
that thing they released is not really
steam<00:04:45.770> machine<00:04:46.070> it's<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.730> machine<00:04:46.880> that's

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
steam machine it's just a machine that's

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.660 
steam machine it's just a machine that's
for<00:04:47.840> video<00:04:48.080> games<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:49.070> want<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.280> think<00:04:49.520> it's

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
for video games and I want to think it's

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.550 
for video games and I want to think it's
really<00:04:49.880> good<00:04:50.060> at<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:50.420> but<00:04:50.990> most<00:04:51.170> people<00:04:51.470> who

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
really good at that but most people who

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.140 
really good at that but most people who
play<00:04:51.740> PC<00:04:51.950> games<00:04:52.070> usually<00:04:52.730> don't<00:04:53.030> get

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
play PC games usually don't get

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.670 
play PC games usually don't get
alienware<00:04:53.630> these<00:04:53.810> days<00:04:53.990> anyway<00:04:54.410> they'd

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
alienware these days anyway they'd

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.810 
alienware these days anyway they'd
rather<00:04:54.830> build<00:04:55.070> their<00:04:55.250> own<00:04:55.280> machine<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.900> that

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
rather build their own machine so that

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.820 
rather build their own machine so that
that<00:04:58.820> makes<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.150> steam<00:04:59.360> machine<00:04:59.500> via<00:05:00.500> wonder

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
that makes the steam machine via wonder

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.370 
that makes the steam machine via wonder
to<00:05:00.950> me<00:05:01.130> I've<00:05:01.670> seen<00:05:01.940> some<00:05:02.180> alleged<00:05:02.810> previews<00:05:03.350> of

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
to me I've seen some alleged previews of

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.560 
to me I've seen some alleged previews of
what<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.370> steam<00:05:04.580> machines<00:05:04.850> might<00:05:05.090> be<00:05:05.270> and

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
what the steam machines might be and

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.840 
what the steam machines might be and
their<00:05:06.170> price<00:05:06.350> points<00:05:06.680> are<00:05:06.770> quite<00:05:07.100> high<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.610> I

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
their price points are quite high and I

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.580 
their price points are quite high and I
don't<00:05:08.210> really<00:05:08.450> think<00:05:08.720> those<00:05:09.140> are<00:05:09.200> what's

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
google chrome and linux but i think that

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.060 
google chrome and linux but i think that
you<00:06:00.110> could<00:06:00.260> maybe<00:06:00.470> strike<00:06:00.770> a<00:06:00.830> deal<00:06:01.010> with

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
you could maybe strike a deal with

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.210 
you could maybe strike a deal with
Netflix<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:02.540> shouldn't<00:06:02.780> be<00:06:02.840> a<00:06:02.870> big<00:06:03.080> deal<00:06:03.220> all

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
Netflix it shouldn't be a big deal all

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.610 
Netflix it shouldn't be a big deal all
of<00:06:04.370> their<00:06:04.490> videos<00:06:04.640> now<00:06:05.150> support<00:06:05.540> html5<00:06:06.020> as

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
of their videos now support html5 as

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.850 
of their videos now support html5 as
opposed<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.550> silverlight<00:06:08.030> playing<00:06:08.390> so<00:06:09.320> you

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
opposed to silverlight playing so you

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.020 
opposed to silverlight playing so you
don't<00:06:10.010> need<00:06:10.130> silver<00:06:10.490> like<00:06:10.610> to<00:06:10.730> play<00:06:10.910> the

don't need silver like to play the
videos<00:06:11.300> anymore<00:06:11.600> so<00:06:12.230> it<00:06:12.590> shouldn't<00:06:12.890> be<00:06:12.920> a

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
videos anymore so it shouldn't be a
