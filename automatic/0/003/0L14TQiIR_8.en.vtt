00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.030
 This is the newest domestic howitzer 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 able to rip in minutes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.559
 offensive whole armored groups 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.049
 adversary or provide lightning 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.359
 the storming of the most inaccessible lines to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 is she maneuvering on speed boom easy in 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.519
 managing secrets artillery 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.519
 installing msta-s look right now 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.630
 This is a unique development of domestic 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 designers of the most modern 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 Russian self-propelled artillery 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.260
 setting 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.780
 places with greeks machines do not exist 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.879
 impossible missions on the battlefield this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.640
 powerful howitzer easy to destroy 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.160
 armored vehicles tank helicopter and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.160
 even tactical nuclear weapons bases 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.590
 places with was supposed to replace 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.620
 another famous self propelled 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.229
 artillery installation Acacia which 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.110
 started developing back in the middle 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.030
 sixties of the last century first 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.280
 that they decided to upgrade the designers 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.170
 this is the highway 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.619
 new car got unified 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.090
 undercarriage from tank t-80 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.509
 it allowed to increase power 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.820
 engine up to 840 horsepower instead 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.039
 520 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.910
 The truth is installation Msta-with turned out weight 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:34.000
 42 tons is 20 tons heavier than 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.289
 predecessor but crew number 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.490
 increased 4 to 7 people and such 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.500
 impressive dimensions 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.780
 did not affect the speed of the car and 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.420
 maneuverability about retained great 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.429
 mobility is about tank level and 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.580
 mobility is about the same mass and 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.590
 significantly increased shooting range 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.280
 body and 100 thousand by design almost 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.799
 same as the tank t-72 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.150
 but there are differences booking 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.630
 self-propelled artillery installation 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.390
 weaker it can provide 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.329
 crew and ammunition safety only 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.010
 from armor piercing bullets and fragments 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.470
 frontal part of homogeneous steel armor 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.910
 can only withstand fire of seven 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.030
 millimeter machine gun 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.540
 from a distance 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.910
 5 meters reservation is enough for 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.380
 it is for the splinterproof that's all 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.560
 self-propelled artillery installation 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.959
 it's not her business to go around the battlefield and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.110
 accordingly shelling there for 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:40.370
 entrenched enemy is the business of tanks 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.239
 this is a matter of infantry fighting vehicles in the msta-s 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.700
 installed 152 millimeter cannon she 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.680
 shoots two types of high-explosive 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.900
 shells and can hit the target on 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.900
 distance up to 29 kilometers 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.549
 and this is a south african self-propelled howitzer 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.840
 g63 but 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.590
 she has more gun caliber than 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.870
 Russian car 155 millimeters and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.540
 means and she shoots further by a whole 10 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.510
 kilometers of Karina hit the target on 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.340
 a distance of 39 kilometers for the truth 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.109
 African accuracy parameters 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.659
 installation is inferior to Russian in 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.790
 several times at 100 s shoots 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.129
 unique guided missiles and how 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.290
 time on the field he flies with speed 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.569
 about 600 700 meters a second 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.790
 accordingly this is the speed of sound 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.919
 there is a maximum that can be heard 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.900
 wool such 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.480
 the main feature of this ammunition is it 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.609
 unique accuracy it is sent with 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.500
 using a laser gunner and already in 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.530
 flight can adjust the course and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.379
 approach a given target even if 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.720
 she moves first trials red 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.200
 fields in saudi arabia just hit 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.599
 all present at the shooting place with 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.689
 using guided shells destroyed 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.459
 38 real objects in just 40 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.409
 shots 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.040
 to hit as many targets as usual 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.290
 shells 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.519
 it would take a few hundred 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.040
 ammunition coordinates began to be set 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.810
 much more accurate calculation which 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.389
 ballistic calculation was introduced 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.880
 everything counted and wind speeds and 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.150
 temperature and temperature of the shells and 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.610
 humidity all all all places with easy 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.650
 hit the tank any fortification 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.110
 construction 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.020
 bridge crossing or enemy point 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.419
 troop control rate of fire 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.449
 howitzers eight nine rounds per minute 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.130
 and a battery of 8 such machines can 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.210
 bring down on the enemy in a few 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.100
 minutes of deadly rain from 70 shells 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.759
 that's just such a hail to survive 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.030
 is impossible 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:51.389
 we are in teams of the new look now 2 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.039
 division artillery about 18 steering wheel and here 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.680
 imagine what fire can 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.729
 the enemy did not even have time to react to 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.550
 Here is a fire raid and destroy 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.020
 low-flying aircraft or helicopters 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.800
 will help this machine gun zenith 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.289
 setting and and caliber is 12 millimeters with 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.229
 rate of fire at 700,800 shots per 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.110
 minute place with air forms whole 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.479
 cloud and shells that destroy everything 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.099
 on its way up to two 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:25.110
 kilometers he takes well 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:28.199
 do not book this type of equipment 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.380
 fashionable lately jeeps with 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.810
 everyones as they are called carts 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.180
 modern yes with all sorts of installations in 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.130
 the skin takes great share of what 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.250
 one and a half to two kilometers naturally 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.250
 infantry he punches light type shelter 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.159
 brick walls there barn some 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.590
 and so on, quite effective 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:53.010
 machine for self defense 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.620
 melee space with comfortable 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.590
 transport and and undercarriage from 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.270
 tank t-80 and therefore not needed 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.000
 special platforms for fastening 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.419
 cars for example on the plane or on 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.440
 rail trailer 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.200
 advantage of Russian development 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.510
 appreciated abroad 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.770
 self-propelled art installation stands on 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.230
 arming Venezuela 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.370
 Ukraine tapioca India and Belarus 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.710
 domestic designers already 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.840
 prepared some changes that 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.840
 will happen with the classic version of msta-s 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.949
 it only remains to add that this 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.199
 pretty artillery mount on 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.960
 caterpillar costs serious money 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.879
 self-propelled howitzers msta-s you can buy 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.919
 for one and a half million dollars for 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.349
 some wealthy Russians if 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.599
 judged by the value of their yacht mansions not 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.849
 very expensive but fortunately physical 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.599
 persons acquiring similar toys while 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.599
 unavailable
