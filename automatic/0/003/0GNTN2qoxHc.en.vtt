00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 if you just live now 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.490
 who just comes to the stage and the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.300
 I just simply say so in itself 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.140
 not harmonized and just let me tell you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.849
 with insane volume selfish 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 that's the way it used to be 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.760
 I was still in the know 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.219
 extreme case with queen is on one 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.219
 page blow since 30 fox ac 30 on the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.350
 other side 10 at the packs and in the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.020
 In the middle of the singer had only one chance 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.770
 because you have a central 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.170
 Sound from above simply tried 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.090
 has with brute violence there still 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.590
 even get a point so that he 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.829
 even still, and center point where he has 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.570
 at all what I hear my knows 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.049
 meanwhile, that's not just numb 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.450
 makes in the moment where you ne band has 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.250
 and one has as a mixer to influence and 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.720
 but also claim that because you 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.460
 is responsible for that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 that is, out there, that is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.240
 I was paid for something and me 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 I'll pay for that in the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.900
 principle, after all, yes we are 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.119
 good friend to our musicians 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.070
 we also have a competence and that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.409
 we must also in the way 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.049
 just bring over and the competence 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.759
 it's just that we're responsible too 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.369
 are for what's up there on the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.509
 fabricate stage and I was or me 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 am somebody and i am after 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.990
 concept that you actively intervene there 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.259
 where you say yes guys fits 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.960
 on 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.759
 Have you ever tried if there are 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.970
 might not be better or look 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.180
 but maybe you can find something 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.950
 It did not exist that time back then 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.240
 today we still have the giant of 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.329
 Huge advantage that you with in her 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 can work in it conditionally for 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.189
 so many musicians right now 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.659
 for example, better or something 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.640
 they might like it 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.060
 button and then a monitor on the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.580
 stage 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.500
 but I have a really great one 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.270
 example recently 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.280
 seen that already four weeks ago 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.900
 a known one of me has the eagles 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.460
 the only concept is that in 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.100
 Germany had taken place that was 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.580
 In vechta, though, he has to praise you 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.590
 say but that was a concept there was 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 I then on the stage could me too 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.490
 Listen to the stage sound 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.970
 I have three times in my life 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.660
 really goose bumps had the sound that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.450
 was the straits at the beginning of the 80s 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.800
 that was 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.080
 supertramp 1997 in montreal jazz 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.730
 festival is nothing more to me 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.950
 sunken 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.890
 and this time again four weeks ago 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.400
 Those were the eagles and it was one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.410
 phenomenal sound is really there 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.190
 It makes you happy when you have something like that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.209
 hears and you just hear too rarely 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.850
 but always every time something like that when I am 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.560
 have something witnessed it was just so 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.910
 that the musicians are not like that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.530
 played disciplined on the stage 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.269
 and I have that before four 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.120
 weeks again 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.220
 they simply have a homogenous nature 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.940
 sound field and that's why it was relative 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:30.580
 simply possible to debut 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.390
 he is 82 at kreml dead and to 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.450
 put it and it was a pr system which almost 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.130
 For 20 years or 25 years 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.780
 all major events later 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.780
 grew used at bap as paper
