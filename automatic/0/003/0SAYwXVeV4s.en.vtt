00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.680
 what would be if the sun is not voters 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.779
 Apart from the fact that we would not be there then 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.569
 Weber is dark on the II 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.149
 and cold 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.630
 for although the sun is our central star about 150 million 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.939
 Kilometers from us 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.970
 our climate is decisive 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.860
 the principle 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.800
 district heating 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.679
 in a big way 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.880
 Although the distance sounds huge, the light does not travel that long 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.460
 only 499 seconds 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 to be exact 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.139
 it finally breaks with 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:54.139
 Speed ​​of Light 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.740
 at around 300,000 kilometers per second 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.020
 the foundation for the same distance around 4400 years 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 although man never really gets that close 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.050
 you know a lot about them 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.580
 thanks to the hubble telescope, for example 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.160
 lonely his rounds in the background 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.430
 and hardworking data 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 and to become cheaper 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.360
 how big the sun is about a thousand 300 times bigger than the earth 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 they know how hard she is 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.230
 339 thousand times more beautiful than the earth 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.680
 and we know what they are made of 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.450
 namely to 73 5 5 percent hydrogen 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 to 25 percent from Lyon 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.409
 And so Kainz comma 5 percent Aust and swift heavy elements like 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.790
 Example no food and cologne 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.189
 the energy of the sun arises in the core 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.890
 Every second 564 million tons of hydrogen merge here 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 to 560 million tons of relief supplies 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.119
 the approximately four tons mass difference per second 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 however, a total power of 3com a7 at 10 high 26 watts 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.430
 but of course that can not go on forever, even when the sun is shining 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.730
 At some point, all hydrogen will be converted to helium 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.110
 and the fusion in the core of the sun come to a standstill there 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.949
 is the oven in the truest sense of the word 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.990
 and as if that was not bad enough 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.000
 the sun will then expand extremely and become one 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.219
 be named red giant 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.709
 The sun is really close 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.140
 even if nobody has been there for a long time 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.619
 even if that sounds terribly dramatic 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.980
 universally they possible our sun 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 only a small plus 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.429
 somewhere far out on a second arm our galaxy 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.429
 the street 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.039
 and, moreover, the sun is that researchers agree at least four 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
 Billions of years seem 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.209
 can see each band 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:26.349
 thanks to the Casanova the Solar Dynamics Observatory of NASA on a 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.349
 wonderful with the hoe in the net 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:42.989
 enjoy the next 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.989
 Billions of years of sunshine 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.319
 we have to get together
