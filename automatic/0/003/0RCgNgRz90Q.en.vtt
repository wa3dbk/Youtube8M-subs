the<00:01:21.210> ends<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.930> angle<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.680> form<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> point

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.880 

fold<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> tie<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.750> half<00:01:27.930> lengthwise<00:01:28.530> with

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
fold the tie in half lengthwise with

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.420 
fold the tie in half lengthwise with
right<00:01:29.340> sides<00:01:29.640> together<00:01:30.500> sew<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.860> short<00:01:32.280> end

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
right sides together sew one short end

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.030 
right sides together sew one short end
shut<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> long<00:01:34.049> side<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> quarter

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
shut and so the long side with a quarter

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.730 
shut and so the long side with a quarter
inch<00:01:35.189> seam<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.670> found<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.780> easier<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.560> leave<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
inch seam I found it easier to leave a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
inch seam I found it easier to leave a
three-inch<00:01:38.280> hole<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.729> turning<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
three-inch hole for turning in the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
three-inch hole for turning in the
middle<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> long<00:01:40.409> side<00:01:40.759> because<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
middle of the long side because it's a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.609 
middle of the long side because it's a
narrow<00:01:42.210> tube<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.840> makes<00:01:43.079> turning<00:01:43.380> right

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
narrow tube this makes turning right

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.130 
narrow tube this makes turning right
side<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.040> much<00:01:44.399> easier<00:01:44.780> leave<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> other

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
side out much easier leave the other

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.319 
side out much easier leave the other
short<00:01:46.530> end<00:01:46.680> open<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.790> insert<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
short end open so you can insert the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.499 
short end open so you can insert the
bead<00:01:49.130> turn<00:01:50.130> right<00:01:50.460> side<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.759> through<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
bead turn right side out through the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.410 
bead turn right side out through the
middle<00:01:51.659> hole<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.829> sew<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> hole<00:01:53.850> shut<00:01:54.149> with

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
middle hole then sew the hole shut with

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.109 
middle hole then sew the hole shut with
a<00:01:54.450> 1/8<00:01:54.840> inch<00:01:54.869> top<00:01:55.470> stitch<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.909> hand
