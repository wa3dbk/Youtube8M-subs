electrostatic charge now when we talk

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
electrostatic charge now when we talk
about<00:00:39.360> electric<00:00:39.960> charge<00:00:40.230> we're<00:00:40.560> referring<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
about electric charge we're referring to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.550 
about electric charge we're referring to
the<00:00:41.190> concentration<00:00:42.060> of<00:00:42.240> electrons<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.230> if

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
the concentration of electrons so if

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.620 
the concentration of electrons so if
something<00:00:43.830> has<00:00:44.010> lots<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> electrons<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.480> say

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
something has lots of electrons we say

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.510 
something has lots of electrons we say
that<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.900> negatively<00:00:46.410> charged<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that it's negatively charged where if it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.010 
that it's negatively charged where if it
has<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> lack<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.000> electrons<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.870> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
has a lack of electrons then it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
has a lack of electrons then it's
positively<00:00:49.650> charged<00:00:50.010> when<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.000> rub<00:00:51.210> a

Ross's<00:01:05.040> hair<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.790> being<00:01:06.090> transferred<00:01:06.720> onto

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
Ross's hair are being transferred onto

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.670 
Ross's hair are being transferred onto
the<00:01:07.320> balloon<00:01:07.439> making<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.280> negatively<00:01:08.850> charged

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the balloon making it negatively charged

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.980 
the balloon making it negatively charged
now<00:01:10.710> Bette's<00:01:11.159> hair<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.789> neutral<00:01:12.329> meaning<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
now Bette's hair is neutral meaning it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
now Bette's hair is neutral meaning it
hasn't<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.319> any<00:01:13.439> charge<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.069> but

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
hasn't got any charge at all but

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
hasn't got any charge at all but
compared<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> negatively<00:01:15.929> charged

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
compared to the negatively charged

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.349 
compared to the negatively charged
balloon<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.189> means<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.909> relatively

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
balloon this means that it's relatively

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.679 
balloon this means that it's relatively
positively<00:01:19.229> charged<00:01:19.679> so<00:01:20.310> since<00:01:20.819> different

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
positively charged so since different

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.870 
positively charged so since different
charges<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.350> attracted<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.249> one<00:01:23.399> another<00:01:23.429> if

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
charges are attracted to one another if

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.050 
charges are attracted to one another if
I<00:01:24.179> hold<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.539> balloon<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.530> Beth's<00:01:25.859> hair<00:01:26.249> we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
I hold the balloon up to Beth's hair we

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.599 
I hold the balloon up to Beth's hair we
can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.109> Beth's<00:01:28.380> hair<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.920> attracted

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
can see the Beth's hair is now attracted

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.840 
can see the Beth's hair is now attracted
to<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.509> balloon<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> what's<00:01:32.249> this<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.609> do

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to the balloon so what's this got to do

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
to the balloon so what's this got to do
with<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.270> Van<00:01:33.450> de<00:01:33.539> Graaff<00:01:33.569> generator<00:01:34.170> well

with the Van de Graaff generator well

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.789 
with the Van de Graaff generator well
the<00:01:35.249> basic<00:01:35.639> principles<00:01:36.179> are<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.389> same

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
the basic principles are the same

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.139 
the basic principles are the same
there's<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.859> rubber<00:01:38.100> belt<00:01:38.459> which<00:01:38.819> moves

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
there's a rubber belt which moves

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.599 
there's a rubber belt which moves
against<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.869> brushes<00:01:40.139> which<00:01:41.069> transfer

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
against some brushes which transfer

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.730 
against some brushes which transfer
electrons<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> belts<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.499> brushes

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
electrons from the belts to the brushes

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069

charged the positively charged belts

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.629 
charged the positively charged belts
then<00:01:49.079> takes<00:01:49.409> electrons<00:01:50.039> from<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:50.399> dome

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:50.639 
then takes electrons from the dome

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.269 
then takes electrons from the dome
leaving<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.359> dome<00:01:51.630> positively<00:01:52.560> charged<00:01:53.039> and

dome electrons are transferred between
them<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.960> we<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.350> as<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> spark<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
them which we see as a spark of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.330 
them which we see as a spark of
electricity<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.740> that's<00:02:19.920> how<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.070> Van<00:02:20.250> de

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
electricity so that's how the Van de

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.620 
electricity so that's how the Van de
Graaff<00:02:20.370> generator<00:02:20.910> work

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
Graaff generator work

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.270 
Graaff generator work
but<00:02:21.900> how<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.350> use<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.920> make<00:02:23.100> a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
but how can we use this to make a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220 
but how can we use this to make a
lightsaber<00:02:23.760> well<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.600> we're<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
lightsaber well for this we're going to

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.950 
lightsaber well for this we're going to
need<00:02:25.350> some<00:02:25.650> fluorescent<00:02:25.890> tubes<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.870> of

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
need some fluorescent tubes now one of

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.660 
need some fluorescent tubes now one of
these<00:02:28.080> fluorescent<00:02:28.530> light<00:02:28.710> bulbs<00:02:29.040> works<00:02:29.370> as

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
these fluorescent light bulbs works as

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.550 
these fluorescent light bulbs works as
an<00:02:29.850> electric<00:02:30.270> charge<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.780> passed<00:02:31.170> through<00:02:31.350> the

the<00:02:41.070> tube<00:02:41.340> which<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:41.970> begins<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.450> glow<00:02:42.630> or

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
the tube which then begins to glow or

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.230 
the tube which then begins to glow or
fluoresce<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.580> don't<00:02:44.820> even<00:02:44.970> need<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
fluoresce but you don't even need to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.030 
fluoresce but you don't even need to
plug<00:02:45.570> one<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.840> these<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.500> get<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.830> glow

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
plug one of these in to get it to glow

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370 
plug one of these in to get it to glow
all<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.910> need<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> difference<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:48.959> electric

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
all you need is a difference in electric

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.380 
all you need is a difference in electric
charge<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.890> region<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.610> another<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
charge from one region to another and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.630 
charge from one region to another and
that's<00:02:52.020> where<00:02:52.320> our<00:02:52.350> Van<00:02:52.740> de<00:02:52.860> Graaff<00:02:52.890> generator

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
that's where our Van de Graaff generator

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:09.110 
that's where our Van de Graaff generator
comes<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.360> okay<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:08.160> our<00:03:08.250> lightsabers<00:03:08.790> aren't

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
comes in okay so our lightsabers aren't

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.449 
comes in okay so our lightsabers aren't
