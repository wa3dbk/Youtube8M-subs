00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.570 
everything in I'm not sure why the
technic<00:02:16.690> launcher<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.830> up<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
technic launcher is going up like this I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580 
technic launcher is going up like this I
don't<00:02:18.760> know<00:02:18.850> if<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.150> fours<00:02:19.660> if<00:02:19.990> it's<00:02:20.140> Technic

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
don't know if it's fours if it's Technic

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.860 
don't know if it's fours if it's Technic
I<00:02:20.860> think<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.459> not<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.940> my<00:02:22.120> mod<00:02:22.390> pack<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
I think it's not just my mod pack I

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.890 
I think it's not just my mod pack I
think<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.410> happening<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.860> other<00:02:24.040> people

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
think this is happening to other people

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.300 
think this is happening to other people
it's<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.260> people<00:02:26.590> all<00:02:26.680> getting<00:02:26.950> my<00:02:27.070> mod

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
it's just the people all getting my mod

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.960 
it's just the people all getting my mod
pack<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.870> will<00:02:29.020> be<00:02:29.110> helpful<00:02:29.290> for<00:02:29.500> them

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
pack then this will be helpful for them

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.030 
pack then this will be helpful for them
so<00:02:30.970> once<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.540> check<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.870> everything<00:02:32.860> should
