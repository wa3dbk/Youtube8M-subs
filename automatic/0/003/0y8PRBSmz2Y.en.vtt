three<00:00:34.380> dots<00:00:34.590> since<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.430> did

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
three dots since that's what we did

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:45.730

that's<00:00:46.740> one<00:00:46.920> finger<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.610> gonna<00:00:47.730> do

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that's one finger we're just gonna do

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020

the<00:00:48.060> same<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.780> fingers<00:00:49.820> trying<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the same on all the fingers trying to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
the same on all the fingers trying to
make<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.330> come<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.540> from<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.440> points

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
make it come out from one of the points

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:28.289 
make it come out from one of the points
of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> petals<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.580> we<00:00:53.910> can

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.190

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
so again just turn the same swirls let

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.800 
so again just turn the same swirls let
me<00:01:32.380> use<00:01:32.560> on<00:01:32.770> every<00:01:33.100> hand<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.540> sticking

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.490 
me use on every hand kind of sticking
with<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.290> same<00:01:36.180> amount<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.390> swirls<00:01:38.110> per

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
with the same amount of swirls per

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.600 
with the same amount of swirls per
finger<00:01:39.990> each<00:01:40.990> one<00:01:41.289> grow<00:01:41.619> out<00:01:41.920> from<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.430> line

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
finger each one grow out from the line

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:52.370 
finger each one grow out from the line
you<00:01:43.240> swirl<00:01:43.509> before<00:01:43.689> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.960 

so<00:01:53.380> now<00:01:53.530> we've<00:01:53.710> finished<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.340> henna<00:01:54.549> design

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.740 
so now we've finished the henna design
and<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.890> looks<00:01:56.950> fairly<00:01:57.460> complicated<00:01:58.000> with<00:01:58.570> all

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
and it looks fairly complicated with all

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.319 
and it looks fairly complicated with all
of<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.110> vines<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.979> dots<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.579> Lotus<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.240> the

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
of the vines and dots and Lotus and the

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.200 
of the vines and dots and Lotus and the
paisley<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.140> peacock<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.030> did

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
paisley and the peacock but I just did

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.639 
paisley and the peacock but I just did
want<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.479> point<00:02:04.659> out<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.320> very

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
want to point out that this is very

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.279 
want to point out that this is very
simple<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.369> far<00:02:06.759> as<00:02:07.030> Indian<00:02:07.630> Bridal<00:02:08.110> henna

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
simple as far as Indian Bridal henna

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.970 
simple as far as Indian Bridal henna
goes<00:02:09.360> typically<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:10.569> take<00:02:10.959> as<00:02:11.140> long<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.590> an

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
goes typically it can take as long as an

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.180 
goes typically it can take as long as an
hour<00:02:12.099> or<00:02:12.400> two<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.330> one<00:02:13.569> hand

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
hour or two just to do one hand

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
hour or two just to do one hand
typically<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:15.730> fill<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.599> spaces

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
typically we would fill in the spaces

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.830 
typically we would fill in the spaces
that<00:02:17.590> look<00:02:17.980> empty<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.630> looks

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
that look empty now so that it looks

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.280 
that look empty now so that it looks
like<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.050> complete<00:02:20.560> lace<00:02:20.830> glove
