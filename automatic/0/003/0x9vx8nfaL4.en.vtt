of the unique and fastest way of

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.030 
of the unique and fastest way of
multiplication<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:07.470> multiplication

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
multiplication and this multiplication

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.000 
multiplication and this multiplication
will<00:00:08.340> be<00:00:08.780> any<00:00:09.780> two<00:00:10.019> digit<00:00:10.290> number<00:00:10.559> by<00:00:10.590> nine

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
will be any two digit number by nine

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.169 
will be any two digit number by nine
cooking<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.750> know<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:14.400> hardly<00:00:14.790> take<00:00:15.000> two

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
cooking so you know you hardly take two

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.150 
cooking so you know you hardly take two
second<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.990> multiply<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.440> let's<00:00:16.949> say<00:00:17.100> you

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
second to to multiply this let's say you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
second to to multiply this let's say you
give<00:00:17.430> me<00:00:17.550> any<00:00:17.699> any<00:00:17.940> number<00:00:18.300> let's<00:00:18.869> say<00:00:18.960> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
give me any any number let's say you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
give me any any number let's say you
fifty<00:00:19.740> nine<00:00:19.920> times<00:00:20.279> nine<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.850> fifty<00:00:21.210> nine

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
fifty nine times nine so fifty nine

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.599 
fifty nine times nine so fifty nine
times<00:00:21.630> nine<00:00:21.859> five<00:00:23.210> three<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:25.609> fifty-one

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
times nine five three one fifty-one

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.839 
times nine five three one fifty-one
let's<00:00:27.300> say<00:00:27.510> thirty<00:00:28.260> seven<00:00:28.619> times<00:00:28.859> nine<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
let's say thirty seven times nine so

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.420 
let's say thirty seven times nine so
three<00:00:30.859> three<00:00:32.420> three<00:00:33.420> three<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.680> three<00:00:34.800> let's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
three three three three two three let's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.420 
three three three three two three let's
think<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> example<00:00:36.120> ah<00:00:36.890> 26<00:00:37.890> times<00:00:38.070> nine

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
think about the example ah 26 times nine

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.500 
think about the example ah 26 times nine
so<00:00:38.550> 26<00:00:39.030> times<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:40.730> three<00:00:41.750> four<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
so 26 times two three four and one

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.580 
so 26 times two three four and one
forty-seven<00:00:45.539> okay<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.010> uh<00:00:47.780> two<00:00:48.780> three

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
forty-seven okay so for uh two three

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.729 
forty-seven okay so for uh two three
four<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.219> three<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.930> mental

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
four two three so how to do that mental

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.850 
four two three so how to do that mental
mathematics<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.399> fast<00:00:53.940> me<00:00:54.530> any<00:00:55.530> cheesy

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
mathematics you know fast me any cheesy

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
mathematics you know fast me any cheesy
number<00:00:56.129> by<00:00:56.280> 9<00:00:56.550> okay<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:56.879> that's<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:57.960> I'm

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
number by 9 okay so that's what I'm

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
number by 9 okay so that's what I'm
going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> cheat<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.710> only<00:00:58.829> three

I<00:01:14.430> should<00:01:14.970> use<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.330> board<00:01:15.689> okay<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.259> let<00:01:16.530> me

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I should use the board okay so let me

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
I should use the board okay so let me
teach<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> work<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
teach you more in the work now in the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
teach you more in the work now in the
brain<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:19.020> 1<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> 10<00:01:19.890> okay

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
brain you have to think 1 to 10 okay

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
brain you have to think 1 to 10 okay
in<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.820> number<00:01:20.970> line<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.350> any

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
in a number line so let's take any

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.520 
in a number line so let's take any
example<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> while<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.909> says<00:01:24.150> 69<00:01:24.780> okay<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
example for a while that says 69 okay so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
example for a while that says 69 okay so
we<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.220> multiply<00:01:26.340> sixty<00:01:27.000> nine<00:01:27.210> by

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
we are going to multiply sixty nine by

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.010 
we are going to multiply sixty nine by
nine<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:29.210> first<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
nine so first thing you have to do is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
nine so first thing you have to do is
just<00:01:31.290> write<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> first<00:01:31.920> digit<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.460> okay

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
just write the first digit here okay

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.810 
just write the first digit here okay
and<00:01:33.210> after<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.110> find<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.340> number<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and after that find out the number of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
and after that find out the number of
digits<00:01:36.060> how<00:01:36.600> many<00:01:36.810> numbers<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.290> there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
digits how many numbers are there

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
digits how many numbers are there
between<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.100> digit<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:38.759> digit<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
between this digit first digit and and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.679 
between this digit first digit and and
second<00:01:40.320> digit<00:01:40.530> okay<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> say<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.509> we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
second digit okay I mean to say here we

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.399 
second digit okay I mean to say here we
have<00:01:42.930> six<00:01:43.590> okay<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.909> six<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
have six okay so here is six and here is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.800 
have six okay so here is six and here is
nine<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.670> nine<00:01:47.850> okay<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.630> how<00:01:48.750> many

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
nine so it is nine okay so how many

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.170 
nine so it is nine okay so how many
digits<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.350> between<00:01:49.590> six<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> nine<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:51.060> know

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
digits are between six and nine you know

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
digits are between six and nine you know
it's<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:51.750> easy<00:01:51.990> no<00:01:52.490> seven<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> eight

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it's very easy no seven and eight

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.200 
it's very easy no seven and eight
so<00:01:54.329> how<00:01:54.600> many<00:01:54.659> -<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.310> -<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
so how many - right so right here - and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.859 
so how many - right so right here - and
now<00:01:58.189> here<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.310> nine<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.729> after<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> nine<00:02:00.630> how

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
now here is nine so after the nine how

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
now here is nine so after the nine how
many<00:02:01.079> extra<00:02:01.350> digits<00:02:01.649> are<00:02:01.829> left<00:02:02.009> okay<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.759> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
many extra digits are left okay this is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
many extra digits are left okay this is
nine<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.360> many<00:02:03.420> extra<00:02:03.689> digits<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.140> left

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
nine so how many extra digits are left

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.550 
nine so how many extra digits are left
just<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.490> ten<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.570> 621

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
just one that is ten so it is 621

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.369 
just one that is ten so it is 621
alright<00:02:08.520> let's<00:02:09.420> take<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.780> more<00:02:09.899> example

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
alright let's take some more example

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.760 
alright let's take some more example
let's<00:02:10.530> say<00:02:11.060> 35<00:02:12.060> times<00:02:12.900> nine<00:02:13.230> okay

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
let's say 35 times nine okay

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
let's say 35 times nine okay
a<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.370> how<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.820> 35<00:02:15.240> times<00:02:15.450> nine<00:02:15.690> always<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
a so how to do 35 times nine always as I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.380 
a so how to do 35 times nine always as I
told<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:16.950> us<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.160> write<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.430> 3<00:02:17.670> first

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
told you for us to write this 3 first

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.570 
told you for us to write this 3 first
digit<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:18.960> figure<00:02:19.680> out<00:02:19.830> how<00:02:20.070> many<00:02:20.130> dudes

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
digit and now figure out how many dudes

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.790 
digit and now figure out how many dudes
have<00:02:20.700> between<00:02:20.880> five<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.420> three<00:02:22.200> okay<00:02:22.380> between

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
have between five and three okay between

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.990 
have between five and three okay between
three<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:22.980> five<00:02:23.190> hundred<00:02:23.370> digits<00:02:23.640> are<00:02:23.880> there

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
three and five hundred digits are there

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.580 
three and five hundred digits are there
between<00:02:24.120> three<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.420> five<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.110> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
between three and five just one that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.560 
between three and five just one that
which<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.860> four<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.790> digit<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.180> there<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
which is four so one digit is there and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.050 
which is four so one digit is there and
after<00:02:28.050> five<00:02:28.290> how<00:02:28.740> many<00:02:28.770> digits<00:02:29.100> head<00:02:29.340> towards

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
after five how many digits head towards

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.760 
after five how many digits head towards
the<00:02:30.210> towards<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.660> right<00:02:30.900> side<00:02:31.110> towards<00:02:31.500> ten

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the towards the right side towards ten

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.000 
the towards the right side towards ten
all<00:02:32.580> right<00:02:32.990> six<00:02:33.990> seven<00:02:34.320> eight<00:02:34.470> nine<00:02:34.650> ten<00:02:34.860> that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
all right six seven eight nine ten that

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.210 
all right six seven eight nine ten that
is<00:02:35.100> 5<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.730> 3<00:02:36.120> 1<00:02:36.270> 5<00:02:36.480> simple<00:02:37.020> okay<00:02:37.710> let's<00:02:37.860> take<00:02:38.010> few

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
is 5 so 3 1 5 simple okay let's take few

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.990 
is 5 so 3 1 5 simple okay let's take few
more<00:02:38.370> example<00:02:38.820> let's<00:02:39.750> say<00:02:40.370> 47<00:02:41.370> times<00:02:41.700> 9<00:02:41.970> that's

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
more example let's say 47 times 9 that's

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.300 
more example let's say 47 times 9 that's
what<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.360> think<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.690> did<00:02:42.840> all<00:02:43.050> right<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.620> see<00:02:44.040> how

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
what I think I did all right so see how

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.520 
what I think I did all right so see how
simple<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.150> how<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.630> do<00:02:45.720> 47<00:02:46.140> times<00:02:46.320> 9

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
simple it is so how do you do 47 times 9

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770 
simple it is so how do you do 47 times 9
so<00:02:46.800> first<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.580> write<00:02:47.700> four<00:02:48.000> okay<00:02:48.630> as

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
so first you have to write four okay as

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 
so first you have to write four okay as
I<00:02:49.080> told<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.530> now<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.370> find<00:02:50.550> out

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
I told you and now we have to find out

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.100 
I told you and now we have to find out
the<00:02:50.790> number<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> digits<00:02:51.240> between<00:02:51.540> four<00:02:51.960> and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the number of digits between four and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.690 
the number of digits between four and
seven<00:02:52.590> how<00:02:52.920> many<00:02:53.100> numbers<00:02:53.340> are<00:02:53.460> there<00:02:53.520> between

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
seven how many numbers are there between

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.630 
seven how many numbers are there between
four<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.180> seven<00:02:54.680> for<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.340> an<00:02:56.490> even

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
four and seven for that we have an even

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.430 
four and seven for that we have an even
more<00:02:57.000> faster<00:02:57.450> method<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.960> just

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
more faster method you know just

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.200 
more faster method you know just
subtract<00:02:58.860> four<00:02:59.100> from<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.370> seven<00:02:59.790> how<00:03:00.030> much

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
subtract four from the seven how much

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.150 
subtract four from the seven how much
you'll<00:03:00.330> get<00:03:00.540> three<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.740> always

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
you'll get three right and always

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.950 
you'll get three right and always
subtract<00:03:02.490> one<00:03:02.700> after<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.690> are<00:03:03.780> two

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
subtract one after that so there are two

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.460 
subtract one after that so there are two
if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.620> here<00:03:04.800> you'll<00:03:05.160> get<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.880> see<00:03:06.470> five

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
if you see here you'll get to see five

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.710 
if you see here you'll get to see five
and<00:03:07.710> six<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.700> two<00:03:08.850> digits<00:03:09.180> okay

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and six the two digits okay

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.870 
and six the two digits okay
and<00:03:09.810> after<00:03:10.140> seven<00:03:10.440> till<00:03:10.590> ten<00:03:10.800> eight<00:03:11.220> nine<00:03:11.610> ten

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
and after seven till ten eight nine ten

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.600 
and after seven till ten eight nine ten
which<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.420> 3<00:03:12.600> for<00:03:12.930> 23<00:03:13.260> okay<00:03:13.950> let's<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.370> more

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
which is 3 for 23 okay let's do one more

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.199 
which is 3 for 23 okay let's do one more
five<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.420> eight<00:03:15.990> okay<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.920> see<00:03:17.130> first<00:03:17.940> digit

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
five and eight okay so see first digit

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.699 
five and eight okay so see first digit
you<00:03:18.270> have<00:03:18.390> right<00:03:18.630> which<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.959> five<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
you have right which is five and the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.050 
you have right which is five and the
difference<00:03:20.100> between<00:03:20.220> eight<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.550> five<00:03:20.910> is

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
difference between eight and five is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.600 
difference between eight and five is
three<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.450> subtract<00:03:21.810> 1<00:03:22.050> which<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.590> 2<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.100> then

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
three so subtract 1 which is 2 and then

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.030 
three so subtract 1 which is 2 and then
eight<00:03:23.850> after<00:03:24.180> eight<00:03:24.480> we<00:03:24.810> have<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.260> digit<00:03:25.530> nine

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
eight after eight we have two digit nine

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550 
eight after eight we have two digit nine
and<00:03:26.250> ten<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:26.820> five<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.390> two<00:03:27.660> simple<00:03:28.200> I

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and ten so it's five to two simple I

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710 
and ten so it's five to two simple I
want<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.220> one<00:03:29.370> more<00:03:29.610> at<00:03:29.760> last<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.570> this

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
want to do one more at last but this

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.910 
want to do one more at last but this
time<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:31.020> will<00:03:31.140> be<00:03:31.170> no<00:03:31.260> more<00:03:31.530> difference

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
time there will be no more difference

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.750 
time there will be no more difference
okay<00:03:32.160> let's<00:03:32.790> say<00:03:33.080> 45<00:03:34.080> times<00:03:34.860> nine

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
okay let's say 45 times nine

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.060 
okay let's say 45 times nine
okay<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.660> first<00:03:37.140> digit<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.590> right<00:03:37.800> four

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
okay so first digit you have right four

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.610 
okay so first digit you have right four
and<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:39.570> difference<00:03:39.840> between<00:03:39.959> five<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.290> four

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
and the difference between five and four

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.199 
and the difference between five and four
is<00:03:40.740> nothing<00:03:40.890> there<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.430> zero<00:03:41.670> right<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.150> you

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
is nothing there is zero right so you

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.910 
is nothing there is zero right so you
have<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.840> write<00:03:43.050> zero<00:03:43.350> remember<00:03:43.770> that's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
have to just write zero remember that's

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.440 
have to just write zero remember that's
what<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.100> want<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.459> say<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.850> there<00:03:45.240> is<00:03:45.300> no

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
what I want you to say if there is no

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.000 
what I want you to say if there is no
difference<00:03:45.840> nothing<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.350> there<00:03:46.500> between<00:03:46.709> two

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
difference nothing is there between two

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.250 
difference nothing is there between two
digits<00:03:47.640> then<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.180> right<00:03:48.390> zero<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.870> then

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
digits then you have right zero and then

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.160 
digits then you have right zero and then
after<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.560> 5<00:03:49.709> here<00:03:49.920> 5<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.400> 4<00:03:50.580> 0<00:03:50.820> 5<00:03:51.000> okay<00:03:51.510> but

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
after the 5 here 5 so 4 0 5 okay but

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.590 
after the 5 here 5 so 4 0 5 okay but
sadly<00:03:52.770> we<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.580> limitation<00:03:54.150> here<00:03:54.360> and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
sadly we have one limitation here and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.980 
sadly we have one limitation here and
that<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.850> something<00:03:56.850> like<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.300> know<00:03:57.330> we

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
that is something like this you know we

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.180 
that is something like this you know we
have<00:03:58.110> two<00:03:58.290> digits<00:03:58.590> numb<00:03:58.740> or<00:03:58.830> something<00:03:59.100> like

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
have two digits numb or something like

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.600 
have two digits numb or something like
this<00:03:59.340> let's<00:03:59.580> say<00:03:59.640> 35<00:04:00.060> okay<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.340> called

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
this let's say 35 okay so this is called

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.570 
this let's say 35 okay so this is called
one's<00:04:03.000> position<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.740> is<00:04:04.800> called<00:04:05.160> tens

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
one's position and this is called tens

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.570 
one's position and this is called tens
position<00:04:06.090> right<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.560> always<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.070> always<00:04:08.160> this

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
position right so always on always this

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.810 
position right so always on always this
rules<00:04:08.880> only<00:04:09.090> applies<00:04:09.510> if<00:04:10.280> once<00:04:11.280> digit<00:04:11.670> is

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
rules only applies if once digit is

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.479 
rules only applies if once digit is
bigger<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.360> tens<00:04:13.110> digit<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.620> smaller<00:04:14.040> okay

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
bigger and tens digit is smaller okay

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.340 
bigger and tens digit is smaller okay
this<00:04:14.910> would<00:04:15.090> be<00:04:15.239> always<00:04:15.390> like<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.020> mean<00:04:16.140> I

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
this would be always like this I mean I

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.250 
this would be always like this I mean I
mean<00:04:16.890> this<00:04:17.070> rule<00:04:17.310> will<00:04:17.459> work<00:04:17.730> for<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.060> 35<00:04:18.540> but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
mean this rule will work for the 35 but

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.610 
mean this rule will work for the 35 but
not<00:04:19.799> for<00:04:20.340> 53<00:04:21.239> because<00:04:21.570> because<00:04:22.140> once<00:04:22.440> is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
not for 53 because because once is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.340 
not for 53 because because once is
smaller<00:04:22.919> than<00:04:23.070> tens<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.580> can<00:04:23.940> work<00:04:24.150> for<00:04:24.180> 29<00:04:24.930> but

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
smaller than tens it can work for 29 but

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350 
smaller than tens it can work for 29 but
it<00:04:25.590> won't<00:04:25.890> work<00:04:26.400> for<00:04:26.460> 92

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
it won't work for 92

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.089 
it won't work for 92
it<00:04:27.419> won't<00:04:27.659> work<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.139> 43<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.979> will

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
it won't work for the 43 but it will

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.059 
it won't work for the 43 but it will
definitely<00:04:29.250> work<00:04:29.550> for<00:04:29.699> 34<00:04:30.569> okay<00:04:31.379> so<00:04:31.770> this<00:04:31.919> is

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
definitely work for 34 okay so this is

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.129 
definitely work for 34 okay so this is
really<00:04:32.219> the<00:04:32.340> limitation<00:04:32.879> of<00:04:32.969> this<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.900> rule

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
really the limitation of this this rule

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.839 
really the limitation of this this rule
okay<00:04:34.469> but<00:04:34.800> I'm<00:04:34.889> telling<00:04:35.219> you<00:04:35.250> this<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.669> one<00:04:35.819> of
