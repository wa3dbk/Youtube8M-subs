the first step in installing the be
quiet<00:00:16.529> sr<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
quiet sr one is going to be the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.240 
quiet sr one is going to be the
insertion<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.689> the<00:00:18.779> back<00:00:18.930> plate<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:20.070> back

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
insertion in the back plate the back

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.679 
insertion in the back plate the back
plate<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> obviously<00:00:20.970> go<00:00:21.420> against

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
plate is going to obviously go against

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.720 
plate is going to obviously go against
back<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> motherboard<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:22.770> screws<00:00:23.550> will

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
back of the motherboard and screws will

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
back of the motherboard and screws will
go<00:00:23.759> through<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.900> proper<00:00:25.140> holes<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.250> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
go through the proper holes now if you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.370 
go through the proper holes now if you
look<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.669> one-size-fits-all<00:00:27.140> intel<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
look at the one-size-fits-all intel and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.229 
look at the one-size-fits-all intel and
AMD<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.250> you're<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.669> to<00:00:29.820> use<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
AMD so you're gonna need to use the

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.940 
AMD so you're gonna need to use the
proper<00:00:30.630> holes<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.380> mount<00:00:31.559> you're<00:00:31.770> using

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
proper holes for the mount you're using

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.549 
proper holes for the mount you're using
most<00:00:32.579> common<00:00:32.910> Intel<00:00:33.360> are<00:00:33.629> in<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> corners

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
most common Intel are in the corners

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.490 
most common Intel are in the corners
three<00:00:35.190> holes<00:00:35.430> 11<00:00:36.210> 1366<00:00:37.170> 11<00:00:37.500> 55<00:00:37.860> 56<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.870> 775<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
three holes 11 1366 11 55 56 and 775 so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.420 
three holes 11 1366 11 55 56 and 775 so
you're<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> screw

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you're just going to put the screw

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.290 
you're just going to put the screw
through<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> correct<00:00:42.390> hole<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:44.210> through<00:00:45.210> the

right<00:00:54.839> on<00:00:54.960> through<00:00:55.170> now<00:00:55.379> something<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> keep

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
right on through now something to keep

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.750 
right on through now something to keep
in<00:00:56.309> mind<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.690> kit<00:00:57.899> does<00:00:58.199> come<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.760> plastic

to have the pipes facing down pipes

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.180 
to have the pipes facing down pipes
ideally<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.560> fit<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:39.890> your<00:02:39.950> case

ideally if you can fit it in your case

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.360 
ideally if you can fit it in your case
you<00:02:40.400> want<00:02:40.550> them<00:02:40.700> facing<00:02:41.060> up<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:42.130> worst<00:02:43.130> case

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
you want them facing up and worst case

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.170 
you want them facing up and worst case
scenario<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.480> do<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> side<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.440> side<00:02:45.680> mount

so<00:03:18.110> very<00:03:18.650> slim<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.190> one<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.580> nice<00:03:19.730> things

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
so very slim but one of the nice things

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.490 
so very slim but one of the nice things
even<00:03:20.360> though<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.540> top-down<00:03:20.959> very<00:03:21.230> slim

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
even though it's top-down very slim

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.940 
even though it's top-down very slim
you've<00:03:21.800> got<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> good<00:03:22.280> amount<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.610> room<00:03:22.790> for<00:03:22.820> ram

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
you've got a good amount of room for ram

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.660 
you've got a good amount of room for ram
literally<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.070> can<00:03:25.190> get<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> couple<00:03:25.520> of

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
literally you can get a couple of

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.830 
literally you can get a couple of
fingers<00:03:25.790> back<00:03:26.090> there<00:03:26.270> between<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.810> and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
fingers back there between that and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.630 
fingers back there between that and
standard<00:03:27.410> high<00:03:27.530> trim<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.040> you're<00:03:28.190> gonna<00:03:28.340> be

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
standard high trim so you're gonna be

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.890 
standard high trim so you're gonna be
able<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.880> use<00:03:29.000> some<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.390> taller<00:03:29.570> heat

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
able to use some of the taller heat

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.920 
able to use some of the taller heat
sinks<00:03:30.230> with<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.940> obviously<00:03:31.940> all<00:03:32.570> four

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
sinks with it and obviously all four

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.710 
sinks with it and obviously all four
slots<00:03:33.290> are<00:03:33.560> open<00:03:34.100> with<00:03:35.000> standard<00:03:35.390> high<00:03:35.480> Ram

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
slots are open with standard high Ram

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.680 
slots are open with standard high Ram
you<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:35.930> no<00:03:36.290> problem<00:03:36.760> taking<00:03:37.760> RAM<00:03:38.120> out<00:03:38.420> or

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
you have no problem taking RAM out or

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.840 
you have no problem taking RAM out or
putting<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.290> with<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.950> cooler<00:03:40.160> installed

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
putting it in with the cooler installed

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.949 
putting it in with the cooler installed
so<00:03:41.570> big<00:03:42.170> wide<00:03:42.350> sr1<00:03:42.770> top<00:03:43.250> flow<00:03:43.660> good<00:03:44.660> looking

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
so big wide sr1 top flow good looking

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.240 
so big wide sr1 top flow good looking
installation<00:03:45.470> not<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.950> easiest

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
installation not the easiest

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
it quite a few times so it only takes me

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.289 
it quite a few times so it only takes me
a<00:03:56.930> minute<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.380> find<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.830> start<00:03:58.489> one<00:03:58.820> screw

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
a minute I find if you start one screw

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.930 
a minute I find if you start one screw
which<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.109> can<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.620> you'll<00:04:01.250> be<00:04:01.310> able<00:04:01.609> to<00:04:01.820> get

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
which you can see you'll be able to get

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.610
