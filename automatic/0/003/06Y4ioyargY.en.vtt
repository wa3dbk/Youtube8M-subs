00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
evolves now here we have phase two of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.470 
evolves now here we have phase two of
the<00:03:00.260> battle<00:03:00.680> or<00:03:00.890> small<00:03:01.190> or<00:03:01.430> close-up<00:03:01.670> I've

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
the battle or small or close-up I've

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.330 
the battle or small or close-up I've
looked<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.230> course<00:03:03.260> up<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.860> books<00:03:04.069> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
looked at of course up in the books and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.210 
looked at of course up in the books and
on<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.459> internet<00:03:04.549> it's<00:03:05.030> not<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.780> clear

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
on the internet it's not really clear

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.770 
on the internet it's not really clear
the<00:03:07.220> well<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.760> deployments<00:03:08.299> are<00:03:08.420> roughly

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the well the deployments are roughly

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.449 
the well the deployments are roughly
clear<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:09.560> again<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.100> nutshell

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
clear so this again is a nutshell

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.880 
clear so this again is a nutshell
version<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:11.120> what<00:03:11.510> happened<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.900> day<00:03:12.019> and

they<00:03:38.600> had<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.840> make<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.019> lot<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.230> noise<00:03:39.440> there<00:03:39.859> to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
they had to make a lot of noise there to

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.580 
they had to make a lot of noise there to
pretend<00:03:40.430> today<00:03:41.109> that<00:03:42.109> they<00:03:42.230> were<00:03:42.290> probably

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
pretend today that they were probably

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.860 
pretend today that they were probably
going<00:03:43.010> for<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> invasion<00:03:43.819> from<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.180> side<00:03:44.450> or

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
going for the invasion from this side or

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.660 
going for the invasion from this side or
from<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.109> back<00:03:45.380> so<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.160> not<00:03:46.340> some<00:03:46.519> sort

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
from the back so this is not some sort

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.990 
from the back so this is not some sort
of<00:03:46.760> decoy<00:03:47.209> not<00:03:47.769> both<00:03:48.769> armies<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.579> about

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
of decoy not both armies have about

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.280 
of decoy not both armies have about
between<00:03:50.450> 40<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.290> 50<00:03:51.950> thousand<00:03:52.519> soldiers

between 40 and 50 thousand soldiers
Caesars<00:03:54.290> force<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.769> probably<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.310> bit<00:03:55.730> smaller

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
but in size they're almost equal so area
