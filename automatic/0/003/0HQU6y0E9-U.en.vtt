explain you a few ideas to get a corner
in<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> circle<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> striker<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
in the circle if you are a striker you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
in the circle if you are a striker you
don't<00:00:33.059> score<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.450> match<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.860> very

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
don't score that match it can be very

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.979 
don't score that match it can be very
very<00:00:35.489> helpful<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.180> team<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.719> many

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
very helpful for your team to get many

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
very helpful for your team to get many
corners<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> percentage<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
corners you know the percentage on the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
corners you know the percentage on the
corners<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.329> score<00:00:39.750> quite<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> bit<00:00:40.290> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
corners we can score quite a bit so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.560 
corners we can score quite a bit so
there<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:41.100> two<00:00:41.309> techniques<00:00:41.489> first<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there are two techniques first one I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.610 
there are two techniques first one I
want<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> show<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.579> camera<00:00:44.579> defending<00:00:45.620> boy

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
want to show with camera defending boy

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.010 
want to show with camera defending boy
standing<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.820> always<00:00:48.120> looking<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
standing there I'm always looking at the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020 
standing there I'm always looking at the
defender<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.129> important<00:00:50.520> thing<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.879> an

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
defender and the important thing is an

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
defender and the important thing is an
accelerate<00:00:51.629> acceleration<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.559> dribble

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
accelerate acceleration in your dribble

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
accelerate acceleration in your dribble
so<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> technique<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.300> train<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so the technique we want to train is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.630 
so the technique we want to train is
this<00:00:54.960> where<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> pull<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> ball<00:00:56.160> you're

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this where you pull the ball you're

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
this where you pull the ball you're
gonna<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.600> stick<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.649> kind

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
gonna put your stick like this you kind

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.220 
gonna put your stick like this you kind
of<00:00:59.160> try<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.399> lift<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.090> ball<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.420> its<00:01:00.539> foot<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
of try to lift the ball on its foot so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.529 
of try to lift the ball on its foot so
I'm<00:01:01.320> gonna<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.430> actual<00:01:02.940> speed<00:01:03.300> like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
I'm gonna do it in the actual speed like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.200 
I'm gonna do it in the actual speed like
this<00:01:03.719> I'm<00:01:04.439> taking<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> ball<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this I'm taking the ball this and you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
this I'm taking the ball this and you
get<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> corner<00:01:06.720> yes<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> two

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
get a corner yes that's one of the two

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
get a corner yes that's one of the two
techniques<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.080> ones<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.979> other<00:01:11.100> one

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
techniques the other ones the other one

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.660 
techniques the other ones the other one
is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> lot<00:01:13.220> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.549> on

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
is a one that I use a lot if you get on

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
is a one that I use a lot if you get on
the<00:01:14.760> baseline<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.470> no

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the baseline you don't see you have no

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
the baseline you don't see you have no
vision<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.880> don't<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> partner<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.840> front

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
vision you don't have a partner in front

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
vision you don't have a partner in front
of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> goal<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.890> want<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> try<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> keep<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
of the goal you want to try to keep the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.179 
of the goal you want to try to keep the
ball<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.479> look<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> defender<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.799> now

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
ball you look at the defender and now

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.310 
ball you look at the defender and now
you<00:01:23.250> need<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.759> speed<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.570> two<00:01:24.869> feet<00:01:25.140> are

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you need to get speed if two feet are

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
you need to get speed if two feet are
open<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.040> pull<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.280> back<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:27.270> body

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
open and you pull it back with your body

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
open and you pull it back with your body
through<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
through it so you can get the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
through it so you can get the
obstruction<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> ball<00:01:30.000> goes<00:01:30.210> through<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
obstruction if the ball goes through so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
obstruction if the ball goes through so
I'm<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.259> show<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> again<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.759> important

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I'm gonna show it again the important

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.020 
I'm gonna show it again the important
thing<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> attract<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.040> defender<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.729> much

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
thing is to attract the defender as much

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.050 
thing is to attract the defender as much
as<00:01:36.210> possible<00:01:36.560> far<00:01:37.560> away<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.490> bump

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
as possible far away and then it's bump

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
as possible far away and then it's bump
bump<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> bringing<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.860> its<00:01:41.040> foot

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
bump and bringing it back in its foot

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.999 
bump and bringing it back in its foot
now<00:01:41.520> we're<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.970> try<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.439> score<00:01:43.439> few<00:01:43.680> goals

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now we're gonna try to score few goals

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.480 
now we're gonna try to score few goals
from<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> baseline<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.950> I'm<00:01:46.950> gonna<00:01:47.159> show<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
from the baseline so I'm gonna show you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.260 
from the baseline so I'm gonna show you
a<00:01:47.670> drill<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.950> might<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.159> useful<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:51.240> your

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
a drill that might be useful in your

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
a drill that might be useful in your
personal<00:01:52.140> skills<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
personal skills you see that there is
