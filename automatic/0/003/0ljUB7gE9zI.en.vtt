00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
out and get a closer look at them you

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.610 
out and get a closer look at them you
can<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.930> still<00:02:22.110> leave<00:02:22.290> them<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
can but you can still leave them in the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620 
can but you can still leave them in the
boxes<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.430> then<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.090> could<00:02:24.239> put<00:02:24.330> them<00:02:24.480> back

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
boxes and then you could put them back

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.360 
boxes and then you could put them back
in<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> bus<00:02:25.230> display<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.860> want<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.160> and

in the bus display if you want to and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.460 
in the bus display if you want to and
rearranged<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.390> seating<00:02:27.600> pattern<00:02:28.200> or

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
rearranged the seating pattern or

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
rearranged the seating pattern or
anything<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.209> works<00:02:30.420> really

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
anything like that so it works really

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.270 
anything like that so it works really
