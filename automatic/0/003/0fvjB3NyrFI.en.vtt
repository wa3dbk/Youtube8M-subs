00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 So there is still opportunity for 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.350
 rectification love spectators the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.179
 the following story sounds like that 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.150
 outrageous that we even got it 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 did not want to believe a seed company 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.440
 has managed a patient on one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 to get natural plant and that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 on ordinary broccoli 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 the decision for that falls to her 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.609
 European Patent Office and could 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.970
 serious consequences for farmers and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 have consumers 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.800
 there are inventions like those of r 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.540
 Those are worth your patent lit immediately 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.489
 on 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.500
 but a patent on vegetables without 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.559
 genetic engineering in it but biologically 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.460
 bred out of ingredients the god or the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.460
 nature created 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.489
 Of course you can say that the seed is huge 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.550
 monsanto applied for a patent for one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.500
 especially nutrient-rich broccoli that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 European Patent Office and its supreme 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.260
 Complaints have long been considered 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.470
 the result the desired package that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 even if the breeding process 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 Process for producing plants 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.420
 are not patentable 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.740
 these exclusions do not danceable 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.000
 extends to the plants 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 that is, they plant that way 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.880
 be made patentable 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 What sounds so complex contains 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 a closer look a clear 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 contradiction because according to eu patent 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 Convention can be a conventional one 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 Organic breeding not at all 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.000
 be patented 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.550
 the product of it now however 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.730
 beautiful 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.080
 that does not come out the same 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.080
 Patent opponents are upset 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.260
 decided in the interest of the industry 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.700
 obviously does not get any here 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.720
 balance out between interests of the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.920
 company and and the patent applicant 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.600
 and in terms of content she is completely 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.400
 abstruse and not only this broccoli 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.619
 decision thwarts accepted 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.080
 German right for Germany regulates 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.970
 the patent issue so patents for 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.970
 plants and animals as products 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.160
 are excluded and therefore could 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.160
 you also do not patent populi 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.790
 problem with the judgment is that it is in the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.940
 precedent is that means all others 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.790
 Similar patent applications will follow 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.960
 this pattern decided now 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.580
 and there are big ones on it 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.010
 international corporations already 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.840
 prepared hundreds of similar ones 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.760
 patent applications are already in the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:50.540
 pipeline and wait for you 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:53.630
 green light get a fruitful 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.670
 business for the patent office for that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.910
 earned with each granted patent 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.640
 and the group anyway of collected 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.510
 around the vegetables royalties of 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.550
 the soup to the room and everyone 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.730
 vegetable gardener who wants to grow the variety 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.069
 have to pay for it 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.410
 that would be a very high one in any case 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.120
 financial risk is a burden on the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.350
 we think about all the others 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 actually can not calculate 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.310
 Consumer gardeners and farmers easy 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.680
 all could be dependent on 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.720
 few companies are advised if the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.769
 Patenting across gardens and fields 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.319
 not stopped 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.660
 organic farmer georg cock can barely 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.790
 Believe that these are serious broccoli 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.880
 Just gone through the decision 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.880
 is 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.680
 the parties are committed to it 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.130
 and now comes the decision that 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.540
 a group slowly in the process 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.970
 can engage the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.680
 food production but what says 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.360
 actually the federal government to the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.280
 broccoli decision where they are 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.410
 declared against plant patents 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.269
 is she writes that 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.859
 Federal Department of Justice examines these 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.209
 decision after that will about it 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.840
 decided which steps to take 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.030
 become 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.430
 does not sound like a solid plan 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.680
 If the politics of the patent tide but 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.049
 Do not put a stop what's coming 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.049
 next a patent on air maybe
