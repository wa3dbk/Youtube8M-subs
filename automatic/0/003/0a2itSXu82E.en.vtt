00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.460 

we've<00:00:02.310> got<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> lot<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.790> grapes<00:00:03.449> here<00:00:03.810> way<00:00:04.440> too

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
we've got a lot of grapes here way too

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.249 
we've got a lot of grapes here way too
many<00:00:04.920> grapes<00:00:05.160> that's<00:00:05.460> good<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.029> plan<00:00:06.270> for

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
many grapes that's good for the plan for

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.570 
many grapes that's good for the plan for
the<00:00:07.350> vine<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:08.550> really<00:00:08.820> want<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.800> vine<00:00:10.800> one

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
the vine we really want one vine one

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.839 
the vine we really want one vine one
bunch<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.940> grapes<00:00:12.210> per<00:00:13.080> foot<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.340> vine

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
bunch of grapes per foot on the vine

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.390 
bunch of grapes per foot on the vine
now<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> when<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.350> vine<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.770> strong<00:00:17.100> now

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now that is when the vine is strong now

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.340 
now that is when the vine is strong now
this<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.730> only<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.180> first<00:00:18.660> year<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> fruiting

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
this is only the first year of fruiting

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.470 
this is only the first year of fruiting
so<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.650> can't<00:00:19.920> let<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.279> prove<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.240> it'll

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
so we can't let it prove like this it'll

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.849 
so we can't let it prove like this it'll
just<00:00:21.720> suck<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.140> energy<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
just suck all the energy out and you

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.890 
just suck all the energy out and you
should<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> balanced<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.510> literally

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
should get a balanced in so we literally

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.599 
should get a balanced in so we literally
have<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.199> come<00:00:28.470> through<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> just

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
have to come through here and just

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.520 
have to come through here and just
remove<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.810> fruit<00:00:32.390> just<00:00:33.390> take<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.719> break<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
remove the fruit just take just break it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
remove the fruit just take just break it
all<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.130> pretty<00:00:35.340> brittle<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
all off it's pretty brittle at this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.590 
all off it's pretty brittle at this
stage<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.739> I'll<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.160> I'll<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:38.910> choose<00:00:39.360> one

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
stage and I'll just I'll just choose one

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.610

to be my first one back here and then

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
to be my first one back here and then
just<00:00:43.829> start<00:00:45.020> removing<00:00:46.020> approved<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> a

just start removing approved this is a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.319 
just start removing approved this is a
little<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> tangled<00:00:49.110> mess<00:00:50.149> he's<00:00:51.149> been<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
little bit of a tangled mess he's been a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.520 
little bit of a tangled mess he's been a
little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.660> late<00:00:51.899> doing<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
little bit late doing some of the

little bit late doing some of the
pruning<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:54.980> but<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.430> once<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.090> got

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
pruning on this but actually once we got

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
pruning on this but actually once we got
this<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.890> will<00:00:59.070> see

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.919

just brutal that's all it is
I<00:01:30.060> taken<00:01:31.060> all<00:01:31.209> the<00:01:31.420> fruit<00:01:31.810> off<00:01:32.049> of<00:01:32.319> that<00:01:32.530> just

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
I taken all the fruit off of that just

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.219 
I taken all the fruit off of that just
left<00:01:33.009> one<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:34.600> back<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.109> one<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.390> first<00:01:37.840> asobi

left one get back to one and first asobi

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.779 
left one get back to one and first asobi
then<00:01:38.350> we<00:01:38.439> work<00:01:38.649> back<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.100> we<00:01:39.189> find<00:01:39.459> out<00:01:39.640> well

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
then we work back and we find out well

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.760 
then we work back and we find out well
well<00:01:40.000> where<00:01:40.810> are<00:01:40.899> we<00:01:40.989> going<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> have<00:01:41.380> our<00:01:41.530> next

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
well where are we going to have our next

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.039 
well where are we going to have our next
one<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.429> maybe<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.939> one<00:01:43.149> there<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
one and maybe that one there or the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
one and maybe that one there or the
other

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.490 

so<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.810> work<00:01:51.990> our<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:54.320> they're<00:01:55.320> asking

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so we just work our way they're asking

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.500 
so we just work our way they're asking
very<00:01:55.920> nice<00:01:56.189> secretary<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.720> with

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.570 

the<00:02:00.630> moment<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:03.720> by<00:02:04.110> hand<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> here

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the moment to do this by hand so here

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.030 
the moment to do this by hand so here
you<00:02:08.790> can<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.210> there's<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.380> bunch<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
you can see there's one bunch and that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.590 
you can see there's one bunch and that
the<00:02:11.190> other<00:02:11.340> bunch<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.850> there's<00:02:12.000> about<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.240> foot

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
the other bunch and there's about a foot

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.350 
the other bunch and there's about a foot
apart<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.290> will<00:02:13.770> probably<00:02:14.010> only<00:02:14.310> leave<00:02:14.730> three

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
apart I will probably only leave three

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.040 
apart I will probably only leave three
bunches<00:02:15.570> or<00:02:16.050> four<00:02:17.040> bunches<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.940> six<00:02:18.750> foot

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
bunches or four bunches on this six foot

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.770 
bunches or four bunches on this six foot
piece<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:21.770> poplar
