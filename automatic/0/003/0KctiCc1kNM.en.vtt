00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:12.310
 good morning to all and we are in mine 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.000
 cellar where I have to repair the parrot 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:19.010
 ar.drone 2.0 that during a flight 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.300
 unfortunately it turned out against a 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.569
 wall and broke the engine board 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.689
 obviously the engines right now yes 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:33.770
 they see all four but indeed if 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.340
 let's look carefully at the lights that the has 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.679
 drone on the four engines one is off 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.949
 completely because unfortunately the led 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:48.559
 microscopic red green yes it is 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:52.010
 literally torn and therefore now 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.399
 we took another engine e 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.609
 we will replace it 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.859
 something quite simple and easy 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.350
 also following the tutorials that are there 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:08.810
 on the parrot site pointit turned off 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.190
 obviously the drone disconnected then the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.430
 battery 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:19.280
 we opened our tool bag 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:22.340
 It is an easily affordable bag a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.700
 little everywhere at very little price where 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:32.060
 I could put various tools and even 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.670
 spare parts for the parrot that I can 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.450
 bring it back at any time 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.740
 of the day if it happens to me 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.230
 something 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.970
 let's take the things we need for now 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:51.860
 one thinks of another beak tweezers and 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.640
 then what is important a tool 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.190
 what it takes to remove it here is 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.240
 this here is used to remove 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.920
 obviously a proper shovel 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.530
 of the helicopter that in this case is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.120
 this one that has the engine from 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 to detach we tie this part which 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.960
 stop by this 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.890
 tool that is very much done 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.240
 specifically to remove these clips e 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.670
 let's go to take it all out, we've got it 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 removed the shovel where the engine is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.890
 failure 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.410
 we also check if the board in the shovel 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.150
 he did not bump into the impact if 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.760
 the gear is in place the couple that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.570
 we have taken care not to run away 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.180
 away while we remove it anyway 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.880
 we always have some of a reserve 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:02.350
 and let's now proceed to remove the various screws 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.330
 which must obviously lead to removal 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.630
 the engine 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.980
 then we removed the three screws that 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:16.960
 they are in the upper part of the shell 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 of the engine with an extendable screwdriver 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.150
 that has the tip magnetized at least so 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.310
 the screws actually remain 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.100
 easily removable now 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.620
 we proceed to turn it upside down 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.680
 the drone and go and remove the others 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.910
 three I saw that are below then we have 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.100
 removed the three rear screws and then 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.950
 we must remove before disconnecting the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.000
 otherwise connector the wires 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.980
 connector does not allow us to 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.120
 it is not easy to remove it 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.980
 difficult indeed has no sockets or anything 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.450
 it is precisely the threads that hold it 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.360
 then tightened to the engine board then 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.480
 we take that off and now we pull out 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.780
 just the engine is very simple 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.550
 because obviously it has now been removed 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.810
 all and let's go completely off it 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.390
 the engine was almost removed a lot 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.370
 gently, of course, also for non 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.699
 mess up 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.910
 and other parts even if we know the 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.710
 engine card is faulty 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.290
 but it also serves to understand exactly 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.800
 how to remove it and then insert the one 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.130
 engine that is right and to the valid card 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.990
 the engine has been removed 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.960
 keep in mind that it should be removed by going into 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:58.080
 forward otherwise the card fails to 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:02.639
 get out of the leg that obviously locks 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.440
 the engine itself is supportive 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.080
 also of the drone 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.520
 here we have the two engines that still 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.350
 actually packed that left 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.220
 the old one that we will keep 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.010
 equally because there are parts 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.430
 which can be useful for any 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:27.060
 what regardless that this engine that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:31.919
 he had only lost the LED 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:35.280
 in fact it worked the same though it is 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.250
 always a question mark because 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.690
 could see courts or the same 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.460
 technology 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.710
 the card could see that it is a 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:49.169
 engine not perfectly with the card 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.860
 valid and now let's go to mount the 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.639
 engine 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:58.979
 the engine was placed before though 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.560
 we have to fix the board with screws 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.030
 put the connector because the children 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.199
 they are short as we have seen 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.610
 previously and if we put the screws 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.539
 then we can't put the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.070
 connector all here for now i close the 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.530
 all 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.270
 here we have reassembled the engine we give 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.840
 put the screws attention to not 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.110
 confuse the screws the low ones with 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.240
 the high ones we reassembled the axle 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.330
 after seeing that perfect evening e 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.849
 not crooked and forgotten all that is 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.630
 now let's do the ignition test 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.150
 of the 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:40.790
 drone to see if the four engines 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.790
 they are all aligned and perfect
