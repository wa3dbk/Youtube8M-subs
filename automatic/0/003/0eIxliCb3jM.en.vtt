00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
console filler that was actually a kind

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.830 
console filler that was actually a kind

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
of heartfelt and it made you feel for

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.830 
of heartfelt and it made you feel for
the<00:02:12.900> character

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the character

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.990 
the character
it<00:02:14.140> really<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:15.040> felt<00:02:15.310> as<00:02:15.430> though<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:15.760> very

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
it really I felt as though was very

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.910 
it really I felt as though was very
unnecessary<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.930> showcase<00:02:17.470> almost<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
unnecessary to showcase almost the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.940 
unnecessary to showcase almost the
entirety<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:20.200> episode<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.920> was

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
entirety of that in this episode it was

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.170

like<00:02:21.129> we<00:02:21.250> didn't<00:02:21.459> really<00:02:21.640> need<00:02:21.819> all<00:02:21.879> that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
like we didn't really need all that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.210 
like we didn't really need all that
fight<00:02:22.569> with<00:02:22.750> pain<00:02:22.989> was<00:02:23.260> cool<00:02:23.560> at<00:02:23.739> all<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.099> you

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
fight with pain was cool at all the you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.640 
fight with pain was cool at all the you
know<00:02:24.310> six<00:02:24.519> paths<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.910> pain<00:02:24.970> vs<00:02:25.420> wisconsin<00:02:25.650> but

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
know six paths of pain vs wisconsin but

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.530 
know six paths of pain vs wisconsin but
it<00:02:26.769> really<00:02:27.010> wasn't<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:27.580> necessary<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
it really wasn't all that necessary to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.420 
it really wasn't all that necessary to
showcase<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.019> especially<00:02:29.739> in<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.129> middle<00:02:30.370> of
