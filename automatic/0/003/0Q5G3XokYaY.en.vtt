00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
character the one key fires a simple box

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.600 
character the one key fires a simple box
it's<00:01:14.030> going<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.390> be<00:01:14.480> some<00:01:14.780> kind<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.020> attack<00:01:15.610> not

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
it's going to be some kind of attack not

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.850 
it's going to be some kind of attack not
for<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.930> first<00:01:18.080> character<00:01:18.320> though<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
for the first character though the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.320 
for the first character though the
skeleton<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.340> going<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.520> have<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.670> sword<00:01:20.000> so

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
skeleton is going to have a sword so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.270 
skeleton is going to have a sword so
it's<00:01:20.480> going<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.660> be<00:01:20.830> probably<00:01:21.830> using<00:01:22.130> ray

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
it's going to be probably using ray

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490 
it's going to be probably using ray
casts<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.180> melee<00:01:23.630> attack<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.320> have

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500

casts for the melee attack that I have
to<00:01:24.620> get<00:01:24.740> implemented<00:01:25.450> but<00:01:26.450> yeah<00:01:26.600> after<00:01:26.960> each

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
to get implemented but yeah after each

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.830 
to get implemented but yeah after each
attack<00:01:27.260> it's<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.980> one<00:01:28.220> second<00:01:28.580> cooldown<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.180> as

character is so as I filled XP bar I'll
go<00:01:47.270> up<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.510> level<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.530> will<00:01:48.650> reset<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.190> XP

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610

so<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.760> game<00:01:54.940> it's<00:01:55.480> not<00:01:56.290> going<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.500> be

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
so for the game it's not going to be

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
actually play the game and I'm probably

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.659 
actually play the game and I'm probably
going<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.319> come<00:02:47.409> up<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:47.620> some<00:02:47.919> system<00:02:48.370> for

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
going to come up with some system for

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.190 
going to come up with some system for
kicking<00:02:49.060> people<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:49.510> well<00:02:49.689> they're<00:02:50.019> not

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
kicking people as well they're not

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.159 
kicking people as well they're not
playing<00:02:50.409> or<00:02:50.739> do<00:02:51.370> something<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:52.090> kick<00:02:52.569> them<00:02:52.810> and

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
playing or do something to kick them and

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.550 
playing or do something to kick them and
then<00:02:54.060> allow<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.090> other<00:02:55.329> players<00:02:55.689> to<00:02:55.989> catch<00:02:56.319> up

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
then allow the other players to catch up

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.149 
then allow the other players to catch up
in<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:57.069> way<00:02:57.219> so<00:02:57.879> maybe<00:02:58.409> increase<00:02:59.409> their<00:02:59.919> level

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
in a way so maybe increase their level

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.659 
in a way so maybe increase their level
to<00:03:00.489> make<00:03:00.669> up<00:03:00.879> for<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:02.169> person<00:03:02.530> dropping<00:03:02.919> but

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
to make up for that person dropping but

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.069 
to make up for that person dropping but
those<00:03:03.879> are<00:03:04.030> still<00:03:04.209> game<00:03:04.389> mechanics<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.930> I

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
those are still game mechanics that I
