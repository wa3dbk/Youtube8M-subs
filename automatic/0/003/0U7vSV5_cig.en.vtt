monkey nanny purely because I think it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.170 
monkey nanny purely because I think it
is<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:20.100> can't<00:01:20.310> rely<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.580> him<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.000> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
is you can't rely on him at all so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
is you can't rely on him at all so
what's<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.470> despite<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> fact

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
what's the point and despite the fact

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.530 
what's the point and despite the fact
that<00:01:23.310> he<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.490> almost<00:01:23.820> definitely<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that he is almost definitely going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
that he is almost definitely going to
retire<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> season<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.409> didn't<00:01:26.040> want<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
retire in the season I didn't want to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
retire in the season I didn't want to
make<00:01:26.909> sure<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.270> Rio<00:01:27.390> Ferdinand<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
make sure that Rio Ferdinand because I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600 
make sure that Rio Ferdinand because I
think<00:01:28.259> he's<00:01:28.470> been<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> real<00:01:28.829> pain<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
think he's been a real pain in this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.300 
think he's been a real pain in this
season<00:01:29.939> yeah<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.869> he's<00:01:31.049> been

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
season yeah I don't think he's been

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.350 
season yeah I don't think he's been
professional<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> maybe<00:01:33.150> Moyes

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
professional in the way that maybe Moyes

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
professional in the way that maybe Moyes
hasn't<00:01:33.689> dealt<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.960> him<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.770> fashion<00:01:35.220> he's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
hasn't dealt with him in a fashion he's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.340 
hasn't dealt with him in a fashion he's
been<00:01:35.430> pleased<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.170> someone

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
been pleased with but I think if someone

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
been pleased with but I think if someone
