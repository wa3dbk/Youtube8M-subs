bond<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.399> holds<00:02:09.580> us<00:02:09.819> all<00:02:09.910> together<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.630> in

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
bond that holds us all together and in

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.110 
bond that holds us all together and in
the<00:02:11.500> end<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:11.920> all<00:02:12.160> push<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.610> support<00:02:13.000> one

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the end if we all push in support one

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.330 
the end if we all push in support one
another<00:02:13.150> than<00:02:13.720> everything<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.709> outcome<00:02:15.100> is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
another than everything the outcome is

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640 
another than everything the outcome is
positive<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.630> think<00:02:16.840> people<00:02:16.989> relate<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
positive and I think people relate to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.410 
positive and I think people relate to
that<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.010> see<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:19.030> really<00:02:19.269> do

support one another and I think that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:37.590
