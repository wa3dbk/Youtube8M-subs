snapping snap up snapping inset and then
another<00:03:14.560> pattern<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.250> used<00:03:15.640> was<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.360> trims

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
another pattern I used was the trims

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.070 
another pattern I used was the trims
ease<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.230> trim<00:03:18.040> zis<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.520> very<00:03:18.880> trim<00:03:19.450> very<00:03:19.810> very

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
ease and trim zis is very trim very very

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.720 
ease and trim zis is very trim very very
trimmed<00:03:20.410> they<00:03:20.590> don't<00:03:20.830> have<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.040> newborn<00:03:21.280> size

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
trimmed they don't have a newborn size

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.420 
trimmed they don't have a newborn size
but<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:22.570> size<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:23.290> smaller<00:03:24.010> than<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
but this size is smaller than the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.960 
but this size is smaller than the
newborn<00:03:25.090> nap<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.720> was<00:03:25.840> making<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.760> is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
newborn nap is that I was making this is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.330 
newborn nap is that I was making this is
a<00:03:28.000> size<00:03:28.300> small<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.130> 10<00:03:30.430> C<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.860> this<00:03:32.890> is

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
a size small and it is 10 C so this is

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.479 
a size small and it is 10 C so this is
the<00:03:33.489> trim<00:03:33.820> Z's<00:03:34.440> fit<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.620> they're<00:03:35.950> all<00:03:36.100> fitteds

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
the trim Z's fit it they're all fitteds

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.350 
the trim Z's fit it they're all fitteds
though<00:03:36.820> these<00:03:37.000> all<00:03:37.239> need<00:03:37.420> covers<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.150> snaps

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
though these all need covers so it snaps

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:50.699 
though these all need covers so it snaps
its<00:03:40.630> side<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:48.660> insert<00:03:49.660> comes<00:03:50.470> from
