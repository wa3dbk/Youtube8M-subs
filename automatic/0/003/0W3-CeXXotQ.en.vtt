00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.020
 electrical engineering focuses on two 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.530
 main areas the use of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.660
 electricity as a source of energy and the 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.260
 transmission generation distribution 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 etcetera of that energy and also the use 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.250
 of electricity but for the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.619
 transmission of information and for the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.600
 information processing in the case 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 of an electrical engineer who is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 working in the power area 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.390
 electrical could be working 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.359
 designing the electrical systems of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 house condominium buildings too 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 could work for a company 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750
 producer of electricity and also 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 could today many are coming out 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.649
 opportunities in the area of ​​energies 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.469
 renewable as it is wind energy or 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.719
 of wind or solar energy 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.610
 photovoltaic or thermal photo basically 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.500
 he gives him the opportunity is a student 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 first have a professional career 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.680
 Very well paid is very satisfactory 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.420
 on a personal level because it is a profession 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.610
 that has many continuous challenges to the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.730
 person you are creating allows you to create 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.640
 New designs allows you to explore 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.190
 experimental can work both in the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 area let's say installation and 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.479
 maintenance as in the area by 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.150
 example of design also wraps another 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.470
 area a lot of creativity so in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 Staff terms is very 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 satisfactory also the person is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 can develop as a leader through 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 to have your own service company 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 in that area all our programs of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.220
 engineering including engineering 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.520
 electrical which we are talking about 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 they are formally accredited programs 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.000
 both at the Puerto Rico level and at 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.430
 usa level in the United States are 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 accredited by what is known as the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.340
 accreditation board for engineering and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.830
 technology 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.310
 geimer and that makes graduates of 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.980
 Hebert programs tend to be more 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.720
 interesting for employers 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.300
 they also have more opportunities to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 receive more substantial offers in the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.610
 time to get a job and also if 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 They decide to continue recorded studies 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.440
 they can apply for certain scholarships and grants 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.750
 that do not have graduates of programs that 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.420
 they do not have that kind of accreditation 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.310
 within the work department 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.830
 federal government that is 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.900
 called the vibrio of life of statistics 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.810
 show that for the decade of 2010 the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.030
 2020 electrical engineering is going to be 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.580
 one of the fastest professions 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.770
 growth and in addition to that of better 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.600
 remuneration here at the university 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.030
 polytechnic and in the program 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.130
 electrical engineering we are very 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.360
 interested in that you integrate to our 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.970
 Program 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.430
 we know that as long as you have the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 disposition the interest mood of 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.690
 do the electrical engineering career 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.850
 they have shown it very many 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.350
 students in the past we have the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.990
 tools and mechanisms for 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.410
 make you successful if you come to study with
