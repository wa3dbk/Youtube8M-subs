color processing inside the Alexa and as

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.979 
color processing inside the Alexa and as
a<00:04:16.039> result<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.760> have<00:04:16.910> for<00:04:17.209> gamma<00:04:17.479> options

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
a result you know have for gamma options

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.830 
a result you know have for gamma options
the<00:04:18.620> first<00:04:18.650> option<00:04:18.979> is<00:04:19.489> called<00:04:19.820> Loxy<00:04:20.510> with

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
the first option is called Loxy with

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.680 
the first option is called Loxy with
film<00:04:21.200> matrix<00:04:21.650> off<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:22.729> is<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.030> most<00:04:23.210> pure

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
film matrix off that is the most pure

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.930 
film matrix off that is the most pure
way<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.080> record<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.830> signal<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.490> gives<00:04:25.789> you

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
way to record the signal it gives you

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.690 
way to record the signal it gives you
the<00:04:26.060> most<00:04:26.270> flexibility<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.320> color<00:04:27.530> timing<00:04:27.830> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
the most flexibility in color timing the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.909 
the most flexibility in color timing the
second<00:04:29.030> option<00:04:29.120> is<00:04:29.510> log<00:04:29.810> see<00:04:30.169> with<00:04:30.620> Phil

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
second option is log see with Phil

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.290 
second option is log see with Phil
matrix<00:04:31.340> on

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
matrix on

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.270 
matrix on
again<00:04:32.599> it's<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.900> log<00:04:33.110> see<00:04:33.409> signal<00:04:33.860> so<00:04:34.069> it<00:04:34.159> has<00:04:34.250> a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
again it's a log see signal so it has a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.369 
again it's a log see signal so it has a
very<00:04:34.460> flat<00:04:34.819> curve<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.539> you<00:04:35.900> need<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> lookup

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379 
very flat curve and you need a lookup

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:37.809 
very flat curve and you need a lookup
table<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.889> look<00:04:37.039> at<00:04:37.159> it<00:04:37.250> properly<00:04:37.610> on<00:04:37.789> a

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
table to look at it properly on a

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.909 
table to look at it properly on a
monitor<00:04:38.030> gives<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.169> many<00:04:39.349> options<00:04:39.590> in

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
monitor gives you many options in

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.830 
monitor gives you many options in
post-production<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.789> it'll<00:04:41.569> look<00:04:41.780> very

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
post-production and it'll look very

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.839 
post-production and it'll look very
similar<00:04:42.409> to<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.800> film<00:04:43.159> negative<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.819> was

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
similar to a film negative that was

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.480 
similar to a film negative that was
scanned<00:04:44.360> on<00:04:44.569> an<00:04:44.690> airy<00:04:44.840> scan<00:04:45.199> for<00:04:45.949> colorist

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
scanned on an airy scan for colorist

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.790 
scanned on an airy scan for colorist
that's<00:04:46.699> used<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.090> scanning<00:04:47.449> negative<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.530> is

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
that's used to scanning negative this is

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.640 
that's used to scanning negative this is
a<00:04:49.069> great<00:04:49.370> option<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.479> third<00:04:50.720> option<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.289> rec

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
a great option the third option is rec

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.399 
a great option the third option is rec
709<00:04:52.129> that's<00:04:52.940> what<00:04:53.180> any<00:04:53.330> regular<00:04:53.720> video<00:04:53.990> system

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
709 that's what any regular video system

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.260 
709 that's what any regular video system
or<00:04:54.500> video<00:04:54.710> monitor<00:04:55.069> would<00:04:55.159> expect<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.849> the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
or video monitor would expect and the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.499 
or video monitor would expect and the
fourth<00:04:56.509> option<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:57.020> DCI<00:04:57.440> p3<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:59.060> is<00:04:59.210> similar

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
fourth option is DCI p3 that is similar

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.860 
fourth option is DCI p3 that is similar
to<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> rec<00:05:00.110> 709<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.430> gray<00:05:01.639> scale<00:05:02.000> but<00:05:02.720> it

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
to the rec 709 in the gray scale but it

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.379 
to the rec 709 in the gray scale but it
has<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> slightly<00:05:03.379> wider<00:05:03.770> color<00:05:04.159> space<00:05:04.550> we<00:05:05.210> also

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
has a slightly wider color space we also

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.839 
has a slightly wider color space we also
have<00:05:05.629> some<00:05:05.780> changes<00:05:06.229> on<00:05:06.349> the<00:05:06.650> viewfinder<00:05:07.159> with

have some changes on the viewfinder with
the<00:05:07.969> viewfinder<00:05:08.449> now<00:05:08.599> we<00:05:08.659> have<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.930> new<00:05:09.080> mode

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
the viewfinder now we have a new mode

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.649 
the viewfinder now we have a new mode
that's<00:05:09.530> called<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.949> smooth<00:05:10.250> mode<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.879> smooth

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
that's called a smooth mode in smooth

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.480 
that's called a smooth mode in smooth
mode<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.110> viewfinder<00:05:12.590> actually<00:05:12.919> gets<00:05:13.099> twice

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
mode the viewfinder actually gets twice

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.969 
mode the viewfinder actually gets twice
the<00:05:13.789> number<00:05:13.969> of<00:05:14.120> images<00:05:14.479> from<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.930> camera<00:05:15.110> so

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
the number of images from the camera so

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.320 
the number of images from the camera so
when<00:05:16.099> you<00:05:16.190> pan<00:05:16.520> you<00:05:16.699> have<00:05:16.789> less<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.210> the

you probably want to know when you're
shooting<00:06:05.419> and<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:06.110> have<00:06:06.319> them<00:06:06.529> again<00:06:06.800> in<00:06:07.009> the

now<00:06:10.719> alright<00:06:11.719> we<00:06:11.779> got<00:06:11.930> three<00:06:12.139> more<00:06:12.169> features

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
now alright we got three more features

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.980 
now alright we got three more features
the<00:06:13.340> first<00:06:13.610> one<00:06:13.849> is<00:06:13.879> a<00:06:14.029> single<00:06:14.479> frame<00:06:14.690> grab

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
the first one is a single frame grab

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.149 
the first one is a single frame grab
going<00:06:15.379> back<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:15.949> camera<00:06:16.159> left<00:06:16.520> side<00:06:18.159> there

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
going back to the camera left side there

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.219 
going back to the camera left side there
is<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.370> grab<00:06:19.759> button<00:06:20.330> has<00:06:20.539> always<00:06:20.810> been<00:06:20.960> on<00:06:21.139> the

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
is a grab button has always been on the

is a grab button has always been on the
camera<00:06:21.590> finally<00:06:22.039> does<00:06:22.250> something<00:06:22.729> when<00:06:23.330> I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
camera finally does something when I

push this button I will see a little

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.689 
push this button I will see a little
icon<00:06:25.759> there<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:27.680> looks<00:06:27.949> like<00:06:28.099> a<00:06:28.129> camera<00:06:28.520> of<00:06:28.580> the

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
allows me to record off speeds much

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.270
