 children's blog video draw 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 very funny with the children in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.990
 kindergarten it's going to be small 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.460
 caterpillar making holes I do not know 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.599
 not I knew you the story the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.490
 kindergarten children love a lot 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.320
 generally it's the meaning of a small 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.020
 chemistry that eat every day a price 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.220
 different and made a little too much in 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.140
 what will we need to do 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.090
 this diy in notebook with three with 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.800
 thick sheets of paint to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.260
 quetsches for children a hair dryer 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.630
 a potato cut in half and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.090
 then brushes then the child has 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.309
 used one of our potatoes for 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 train the body of the caterpillar he is going 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.160
 put some green paint on one of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 my potatoes and make some 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 round prints he will be able to make 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 rotational movements with the apple of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.390
 earth to make sure they have some 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.670
 paint all over the print he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 may also superimpose fingerprints 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.520
 to form the body of the caterpillar 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.920
 the case of China is open but 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.110
 have fun to paint more 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.150
 beautiful the child to add a little bit 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 blue or a little bit of yellow in the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.570
 green color and have round 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 different 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.040
 slightly different the head of the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.659
 red yesterday chain 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.970
 so now the child he will use 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 a hair dryer to thoroughly dry the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 body of chemistry to make sure that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 colors will not mix and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.259
 then he will learn a fine brush 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.710
 she will draw the paws of the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.320
 caterpillar in red eyes and mouth 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 and then in fact our chemistry she is a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 little bit for him so he had to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.939
 draw the points also and 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.560
 quickly drawn a sheet in 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.479
 underneath so that she does not fall 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 hold on a sheet 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.540
 so for those who know 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 the story of the little caterpillar that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.700
 does holes well they can 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.659
 draw the fruits 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.850
 who are in the story for others 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.009
 imagine this fruit or vegetable because 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.969
 the little puppy will not bite what their 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.490
 made holes in it 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.719
 here we can imagine a pear promised 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.659
 an apple a 13 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.789
