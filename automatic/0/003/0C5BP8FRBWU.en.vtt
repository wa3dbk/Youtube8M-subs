00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
and let me tell you the KD ranges so for

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.049 
and let me tell you the KD ranges so for
the<00:00:35.739> knife<00:00:35.980> you're<00:00:36.430> probably<00:00:36.730> gonna<00:00:36.970> need

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
the knife you're probably gonna need

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.150 
the knife you're probably gonna need
anywhere<00:00:37.690> from<00:00:38.340> 100<00:00:39.340> plus<00:00:39.790> kills<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:41.019> downs<00:00:41.290> so

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
anywhere from 100 plus kills to downs so

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.369 
anywhere from 100 plus kills to downs so
and<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:42.670> figure<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:43.059> out<00:00:43.239> by<00:00:43.480> going<00:00:43.510> into

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
and you figure that out by going into

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.790 
and you figure that out by going into
your<00:00:44.590> statistics<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:46.379> finding<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.530> amount

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
your statistics and finding the amount

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.920 
your statistics and finding the amount
of<00:00:47.860> kills<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.519> and<00:00:48.760> dividing<00:00:49.629> it<00:00:49.750> by<00:00:49.900> the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
of kills you have and dividing it by the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.950 
of kills you have and dividing it by the
amount<00:00:50.199> of<00:00:50.860> downs<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:51.729> have<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.180> that's<00:00:52.780> how

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
amount of downs you have and that's how

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.079 
amount of downs you have and that's how
you<00:00:53.019> figure<00:00:53.260> out<00:00:53.379> your<00:00:53.589> KD<00:00:53.860> so<00:00:54.580> let's<00:00:54.790> get<00:00:54.940> back

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
you figure out your KD so let's get back

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.369 
you figure out your KD so let's get back
to<00:00:55.330> it<00:00:55.479> for<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.750> knife<00:00:55.930> you're<00:00:56.080> gonna<00:00:56.170> need

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
to it for the knife you're gonna need

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.090 
to it for the knife you're gonna need
anywhere<00:00:56.860> from<00:00:57.070> like<00:00:57.280> probably<00:00:57.580> 100<00:00:58.390> plus<00:00:59.379> for

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
anywhere from like probably 100 plus for

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.299 
anywhere from like probably 100 plus for
is<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.460> knife<00:01:01.140> emblem<00:01:02.140> on<00:01:02.260> zombies<00:01:02.799> but

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
is a knife emblem on zombies but

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.710 
is a knife emblem on zombies but
shotguns<00:01:03.850> they're<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> little<00:01:04.420> bit<00:01:04.540> more

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
shotguns they're a little bit more

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.990 
shotguns they're a little bit more
tricky<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:05.860> for<00:01:06.220> shotguns<00:01:06.460> you're<00:01:06.880> gonna

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
tricky so for shotguns you're gonna

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.730 
tricky so for shotguns you're gonna
probably<00:01:07.299> need<00:01:07.479> two<00:01:07.840> hundred-plus<00:01:08.320> maybe

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
probably need two hundred-plus maybe

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.039 
probably need two hundred-plus maybe
even<00:01:09.460> 250<00:01:10.390> kills<00:01:11.260> to<00:01:11.740> down<00:01:12.150> ratio<00:01:13.150> if<00:01:13.510> you're

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
even 250 kills to down ratio if you're

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.289 
even 250 kills to down ratio if you're
unlucky<00:01:14.290> so<00:01:15.130> you're<00:01:15.430> gonna<00:01:15.549> also<00:01:15.850> need<00:01:16.090> a

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
unlucky so you're gonna also need a

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.800 
unlucky so you're gonna also need a
certain<00:01:16.810> amount<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.140> kills<00:01:17.469> I<00:01:17.680> predict<00:01:18.039> around

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
certain amount of kills I predict around

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.230 
certain amount of kills I predict around
40,000<00:01:19.810> at<00:01:19.930> most<00:01:20.289> if<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.740> qualify<00:01:21.100> for<00:01:21.759> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
40,000 at most if you qualify for the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.319 
40,000 at most if you qualify for the
shotgun<00:01:22.539> rank<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.320> then<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.740> should<00:01:23.920> get<00:01:24.130> it

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
shotgun rank and then you should get it

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.819 
shotgun rank and then you should get it
second<00:01:25.329> you're<00:01:25.600> also<00:01:25.810> gonna<00:01:26.079> need<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.380> certain

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
second you're also gonna need a certain

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.859 
second you're also gonna need a certain
amount<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.189> online<00:01:27.759> games<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.420> sitting<00:01:28.719> in<00:01:28.810> a

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
amount of online games so sitting in a

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.929 
amount of online games so sitting in a
private<00:01:29.320> match<00:01:29.469> won't<00:01:30.219> get<00:01:30.429> you<00:01:30.579> anywhere

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
private match won't get you anywhere

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.630 
private match won't get you anywhere
really<00:01:31.329> so<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:32.289> I<00:01:32.469> recommend<00:01:33.039> getting<00:01:33.399> with

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
some friends playing some four-person

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.830

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.899 
online co-op have fun gets high rounds
and<00:01:41.320> shouldn't<00:01:41.619> pretty<00:01:42.100> much<00:01:42.280> help<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.579> with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
and shouldn't pretty much help you with

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.779 
and shouldn't pretty much help you with
the<00:01:43.270> online<00:01:43.749> games<00:01:44.109> pretty<00:01:44.409> much<00:01:44.579> aside<00:01:45.579> from

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
the online games pretty much aside from

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.669 
the online games pretty much aside from
all<00:01:45.969> that<00:01:46.179> I<00:01:46.329> recommend<00:01:46.869> getting<00:01:47.020> some<00:01:47.380> high

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
all that I recommend getting some high

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.399 
all that I recommend getting some high
rounds<00:01:48.340> try<00:01:48.909> for<00:01:49.149> thirty-plus<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.869> all<00:01:50.079> maps

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
rounds try for thirty-plus on all maps

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.950 
rounds try for thirty-plus on all maps
don't<00:01:51.369> do<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:51.789> solo<00:01:52.090> because<00:01:52.509> although<00:01:52.689> it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
don't do it on solo because although it

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.929 
don't do it on solo because although it
counts<00:01:53.320> towards<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.740> leaderboards<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.759> not

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
counts towards the leaderboards it's not

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.849 
counts towards the leaderboards it's not
technically<00:01:55.420> an<00:01:55.600> online<00:01:56.109> game<00:01:56.409> because<00:01:56.740> it

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
technically an online game because it

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.730 
technically an online game because it
doesn't<00:01:57.130> qualify<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.729> for<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.630> Tally's<00:01:59.109> so

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
doesn't qualify you for the Tally's so

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.800 
doesn't qualify you for the Tally's so
therefore<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.219> don't<00:02:00.520> think<00:02:01.179> it's<00:02:01.329> considered

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
therefore I don't think it's considered

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.459 
therefore I don't think it's considered
an<00:02:02.020> online<00:02:02.499> game<00:02:02.799> truly<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.869> also<00:02:04.869> if<00:02:05.289> you
