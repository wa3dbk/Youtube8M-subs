culture<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.099> Europe<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.759> good<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.000> England

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
culture in Europe not so good in England

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.590

of<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.960> wanting<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> waste<00:00:34.620> things<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
of not wanting to waste things so the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
of not wanting to waste things so the
idea<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.440> you've<00:00:37.559> finished<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.550> the

rice that you've done there's a bit of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
rice that you've done there's a bit of

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
leftovers they'll make something else

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.190

seconds longer now the ratio is always
two<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.570> measures<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> water<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.950> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
two to two measures of water to one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
two to two measures of water to one
measure<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.580> rice<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> do

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
measure of rice so what I'm going to do

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.280 
measure of rice so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:11.189> tip<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.030> water<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.689> give<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
is just tip this water in here give it a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
is just tip this water in here give it a
good<00:01:16.380> old<00:01:16.560> mix<00:01:19.130> now<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> turn<00:01:20.640> the

good old mix now I'm going to turn the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
good old mix now I'm going to turn the
gas<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.830> lowest<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.430> possibly

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
gas down to the lowest that I possibly

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
gas down to the lowest that I possibly
can<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.659> we'll<00:01:25.110> leave<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
can and we'll leave it on there for

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
can and we'll leave it on there for
about<00:01:26.400> 15<00:01:27.150> minutes<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> key<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.740> during

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
about 15 minutes and the key now during

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.300 
about 15 minutes and the key now during
the<00:01:29.310> cooking<00:01:29.520> process<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.049> touch<00:01:31.320> or

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the cooking process is not to touch or

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
the cooking process is not to touch or
mix<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> gets<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
mix the right because then that gets the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
mix the right because then that gets the
starch<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.970> creates<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
starch going and that's what creates a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
starch going and that's what creates a
really<00:01:36.780> gloopy<00:01:37.259> sticky<00:01:37.680> rice<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.549> you've<00:01:38.670> just

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.280 
oh yeah
a<00:02:11.959> bit<00:02:12.349> of<00:02:12.500> Parmesan<00:02:13.310> cheese<00:02:13.390> I've<00:02:14.390> got<00:02:14.989> some

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
a bit of Parmesan cheese I've got some

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.670 
a bit of Parmesan cheese I've got some
parsley<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.459> goes<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.700> there<00:02:16.909> a<00:02:17.500> pinch<00:02:18.500> of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
parsley so that goes in there a pinch of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.539 
parsley so that goes in there a pinch of
salt<00:02:19.299> I'm<00:02:20.299> going<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.540> add<00:02:20.689> a<00:02:20.930> tiny<00:02:21.530> tiny<00:02:22.219> drop

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
salt I'm going to add a tiny tiny drop

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.149 
salt I'm going to add a tiny tiny drop
of<00:02:22.819> water<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.540> then<00:02:24.290> I'm<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.530> going<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.859> mix

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
of water and then I'm just going to mix

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.679 
of water and then I'm just going to mix
all<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.030> together<00:02:29.439> to<00:02:30.439> form<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.889> bind

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
all of this together to form a bind

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.000 
all of this together to form a bind
but<00:02:32.689> that<00:02:32.810> binds<00:02:33.109> got<00:02:33.349> quite<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.709> flavor

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
but that binds got quite a lot of flavor

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.699 
but that binds got quite a lot of flavor
in<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.700> I'm<00:02:35.060> not<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:35.689> add<00:02:35.840> as

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
in it and I'm not just going to add as

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.209 
in it and I'm not just going to add as
much<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.129> this<00:02:37.280> rice<00:02:37.549> as<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.450> dare<00:02:38.980> now<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> good

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 
much of this rice as I dare now the good

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.949 
much of this rice as I dare now the good
thing<00:02:40.280> about<00:02:40.609> cooking<00:02:40.879> rice<00:02:41.239> properly<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.840> it

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
thing about cooking rice properly is it

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:59.280 
thing about cooking rice properly is it
won't<00:02:42.139> stick<00:02:42.409> together<00:02:49.840> add<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.900> bit<00:02:51.139> more

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.479 

in<00:03:00.290> fact<00:03:00.530> I'm<00:03:00.769> probably<00:03:00.889> going<00:03:01.159> to<00:03:01.219> end<00:03:01.280> up

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
in fact I'm probably going to end up

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:09.789

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
next stage is just to make it into

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.319 
next stage is just to make it into
little<00:03:11.930> rice<00:03:12.169> balls<00:03:12.699> which<00:03:13.699> I'm<00:03:13.909> now<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.239> to

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
little rice balls which I'm now going to

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.479 
little rice balls which I'm now going to
do<00:03:16.359> so<00:03:17.359> we<00:03:17.479> put<00:03:17.720> we've<00:03:18.560> taken<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.129> cooked<00:03:19.370> rice

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
now is just scrunch them into little

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.300 
now is just scrunch them into little
patties<00:03:24.919> like<00:03:25.459> this<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.769> meats<00:03:27.979> just<00:03:28.189> a

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
a bit of extra flour to it just just to

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.800 
a bit of extra flour to it just just to
help<00:03:32.569> bind<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.049> together<00:03:33.229> and<00:03:34.120> as<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.629> can<00:03:35.750> see

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810
