00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.240
 today we are going to make chocolate boobies 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.400
 to be boobies, we're going to need two 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.470
 cups of flour a cup of sugar one 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.750
 rate of cocoa powder half a cup of 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:24.190
 butter an egg yolk 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 and then half a cup of hot water and 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:32.130
 half a cup of milk we will also need 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.830
 a spoonful of vanilla scent 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.610
 also a spoonful of baking soda and 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.280
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.830
 remember that to measure the rates 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.070
 It is always practical to use these 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.070
 Utensils 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.320
 good 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 Hello 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.019
 Melt the butter in a double boiler and 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:10.200
 we throw it into a bowl together with the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.200
 sugar and then we mix it 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.100
 well when the blender until it's 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.100
 United 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.600
 do not 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.220
 in half a glass of hot water we mix 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.220
 the bicarbonate 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.930
 until it dissolves 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.979
 well now after mixing it and that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.450
 be united let's go adding the three 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.780
 the three components the milk and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.360
 we mix a little 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.960
 and then the hot water 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.520
 with the baking 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.520
 we mix a little 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:37.440
 and always the flour mixture always 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.440
 we finished with the flour mixture 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.260
 and we repeat this process all 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.820
 the times it takes until 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.820
 finish all goals 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.820
 you mix it well until the dough is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.520
 well united if not then you can do it 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.940
 with chips or if not with a blender like 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.830
 You see the mass because it is not liquid because 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.950
 they're going to be cookies and we have to 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.950
 form with two teaspoons of mixtures 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 the next step is to put the fabric of 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:26.159
 silicone onto your baking tray and go 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.500
 putting good I always do it with 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.090
 two teaspoons but also the recipe 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.769
 It usually says that you love him 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.290
 you want to me I do not like to get dirty 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.930
 fingers so I do it directly with 2 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.120
 teaspoons separating cookies 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.790
 in a distance so they can grow 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.340
 without sticking to each other 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.829
 I'm not always very successful with that but 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.829
 good and now we will put it in the oven 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.020
 while we are waiting for them to be done 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.440
 the cookies we can make the filling of 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.740
 the cookie for this we will need 2 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.410
 cups of icing sugar 4 tablespoons 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.980
 soup bowls of melted butter 3 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.500
 spoonfuls of cream and then 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.650
 we will need a spoonful of aroma of 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.690
 vanilla and a pinch of salt and remember 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.549
 that if you do not have always comes useful 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.940
 have these tools to measure the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.940
 cups 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.620
 i 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.080
 and 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.480
 and 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.180
 ah 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
 ah 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.010
 you take a cookie 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.010
 and the spas is a little filling 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.389
 then you put another cap and here 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.910
 you have your delicious cookie too good and 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.970
 look look at how the delicious buki looks 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.240
 and so you continue with all the cookies 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.950
 that you have to do the truth that 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.080
 yet we have not finished 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.650
 make the whole dough so I could not 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.660
 tell you how many cookies come out but if 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.680
 It comes out like a little cake with a 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.220
 very rich filling 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.020
 and so we continue with all the cookies a 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.789
 little bit of stuffing I'm really 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.800
 happening a little bit it would have to be less 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:06.870
 stuffing what I 'm putting 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.870
 and the cookie 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.660
 and here you have these bubis made for 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.660
 to snack
