I put mine I put mine kind of right here
and<00:00:32.420> I<00:00:33.420> scoop<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.080> not<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.190> hard<00:00:35.400> as<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.580> can<00:00:35.730> but

and I scoop it not as hard as I can but
with<00:00:36.330> a<00:00:36.360> pretty<00:00:36.720> good<00:00:37.340> force<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:39.050> scooping

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
with a pretty good force of scooping

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.620 
with a pretty good force of scooping
yeah<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.650> this<00:00:43.650> foot<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.850> front<00:00:45.120> foot<00:00:45.180> I

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
yeah and this foot your front foot I

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.680 
yeah and this foot your front foot I
guess<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.829> could<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.040> I<00:00:47.579> put<00:00:48.240> mine<00:00:48.420> right

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
guess you could put I put mine right

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
guess you could put I put mine right
here<00:00:49.700> this<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> easier<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> guess<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.690> try

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
here this is easier so I guess just try

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.370 
here this is easier so I guess just try
what<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.989> doing<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:56.780> we<00:00:57.780> could<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.290> it

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
what I'm doing and we could just put it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.600 
what I'm doing and we could just put it
right<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.710> when<00:01:01.710> you're<00:01:01.829> doing<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.070> 360

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
right here so when you're doing the 360

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.990 
right here so when you're doing the 360
shove-it<00:01:03.350> what<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.500> had<00:01:04.649> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.580> scoop

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
shove-it what you had to do is a scoop

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
shove-it what you had to do is a scoop
really<00:01:06.300> hard<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.720> hit<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.290> foot

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
really hard with this hit with this foot

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
really hard with this hit with this foot
so<00:01:08.490> basically<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.170> this

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so basically it's gonna look like this

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
so basically it's gonna look like this
or<00:01:11.570> maybe<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.990> you're<00:01:13.140> first<00:01:13.350> learning<00:01:13.500> it
