00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
very valuable you know last year like I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.160 
very valuable you know last year like I
said<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.520> came<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.390> really<00:02:39.930> didn't<00:02:40.140> know

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
said I came in I I really didn't know

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500 
said I came in I I really didn't know
where<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.030> learned<00:02:42.270> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
where what was going on but I learned so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.020 
where what was going on but I learned so
much<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.050> 17<00:02:43.320> rounds<00:02:43.770> last<00:02:44.100> year<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.580> so

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
much of that 17 rounds last year and so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.140 
much of that 17 rounds last year and so
I<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.750> basically<00:02:46.640> mainly<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.670> need<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.940> carry

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
I think basically mainly I need to carry

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.460 
I think basically mainly I need to carry
that<00:02:48.239> over<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.660> year<00:02:48.870> what<00:02:49.110> I've<00:02:49.200> learned

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
that over to this year what I've learned

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.350 
that over to this year what I've learned
and<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.830> also<00:02:50.489> keep<00:02:50.670> searching<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.209> what

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and and also keep searching to what

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.050 
and and also keep searching to what
areas<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.780> could<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:52.080> better<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.769> guess<00:02:53.250> to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
areas I could be better at so I guess to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.490 
areas I could be better at so I guess to
see<00:02:54.239> where<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.570> first<00:02:54.780> few<00:02:54.930> rounds<00:02:55.050> lead<00:02:55.350> us

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
see where the first few rounds lead us

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.259 
see where the first few rounds lead us
and<00:02:55.709> then<00:02:56.040> try<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.700> carry<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.239> on

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
and then try to you know carry it on

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.790 
and then try to you know carry it on
after<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.870> work<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.200> what<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.440> have<00:02:58.620> to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
and I guess to see where we're at in the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.630 
and I guess to see where we're at in the
beginning<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:00.980> another<00:03:01.980> year<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.280> experience

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
