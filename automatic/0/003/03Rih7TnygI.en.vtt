of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> cupcake<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.860> started<00:02:08.160> adding

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of the cupcake now when I started adding

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.100 
of the cupcake now when I started adding
a<00:02:08.520> chocolate<00:02:08.879> chip<00:02:09.030> wheels<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.509> realized<00:02:09.929> that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
a chocolate chip wheels I realized that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.380 
a chocolate chip wheels I realized that
the<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.280> bus<00:02:11.459> seemed<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.030> too<00:02:12.180> high

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the the bus seemed to be a bit too high

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.850 
the the bus seemed to be a bit too high
so<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:13.110> removed<00:02:13.500> one

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so I just removed one

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
so I just removed one
the<00:02:13.980> layers<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.270> cookies<00:02:15.570> let's<00:02:15.780> cookies

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the layers of the cookies let's cookies

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.290 
the layers of the cookies let's cookies
separate<00:02:16.500> quite<00:02:16.710> easily<00:02:16.950> into<00:02:17.370> layers<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
separate quite easily into layers and I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.820 
separate quite easily into layers and I
just<00:02:18.450> remove<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> bottom<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.560> then

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
just remove the bottom one and then

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.530 
just remove the bottom one and then
added<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> two<00:02:20.490> chocolate<00:02:20.880> chips<00:02:21.120> for<00:02:21.210> wheels

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
added the two chocolate chips for wheels

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
added the two chocolate chips for wheels
and<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.200> found<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> wheels<00:02:22.740> looked<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.040> lot

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and I found the wheels looked a lot

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.690 
and I found the wheels looked a lot
better<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.660> thinner<00:02:25.200> school<00:02:25.650> bus<00:02:25.830> clearly

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
better with a thinner school bus clearly

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.910 
better with a thinner school bus clearly

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
the details on it certainly be a lot

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.540 
the details on it certainly be a lot
easier<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.230> sky<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.530> added<00:02:34.830> looper<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
easier in the sky I added looper that I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.490 
easier in the sky I added looper that I
also<00:02:35.730> added<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.300> little<00:02:36.450> fun<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.320> some
