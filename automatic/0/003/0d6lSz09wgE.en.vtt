00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.170

 to spread this infection from in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 first chapter called alarms 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.219
 where 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.190
 patient zero in a village in some 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.460
 Instead of the Chinese government will try 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 to cover all this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 how will the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.250
 infection that is going to be the government 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.129

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 close your border but not only to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.940
 close but to build a wall 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.290

 create the pharmaceutical disque vaccines 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.320
 for this infection which are not going to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.009
 It is only serve anything to get 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.130
 money and the best chapter of that novel 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.799
 the great panic 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 there is going to tell us the rise of this 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 zombie apocalypse like every citizen 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.770
 from the most remote place in the world 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.580
 South Africa 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.250
 beijing india usa not once now 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 except for this infection as the army 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 will suffer defeats after defeat not 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.270
 only in new york but throughout 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.640
 all the world 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.119
 how the armed forces are going to be 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.610
 ten you kill under the big zombie army 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.700
 that is going to be a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.190
 army that for every victory that has 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.360
 not only has the victory but 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.120
 compared to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.480
 the army of the USA to any other 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.720
 country 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.239
 any soldier except in the army 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
 is going to be a soldier more on the side of the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.830
 zombies so imagine the big ones 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.900
 proportions of this infection the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.030
 next chapter called change of 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.210
 tide as the governments of israel of 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.490
 South Africa 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.370
 the governments of the former Soviet Union 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.030
 they will try to save what is left of 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.640
 the population of their armies but at 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890
 save the population or the army it 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.380
 you have to choose if you save the army 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.600
 you are going to have to send a part of your 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.660
 population to serve as bait 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.570
 to the zombies while the army escapes 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.840
 this is how they are going to act not only 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.150
 the Ukrainian governments but several 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.580
 countries across the world from there I 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.490
 I'm going to jump to the war chapter 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.430
 total where the counteroffensive will be 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.050
 of the us army as always they 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.510
 they are going to be the ones who are going to save the world 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.710
 them once they have already learned to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.500
 survive the zombies in the north in 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.140
 the submarines because as well 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.580
 they show in the movie the submarines 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.220
 the aircraft carriers the cargo ships and 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.440
 everything that floats is the only way to 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.060
 survive once they manage to survive 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.520
 they will organize their offensive organizing 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.910
 an endless line of men 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.880
 advancing step by step sweeping all the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.120
 country to leave cities or states 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.180
 free zombies the movie is going to have 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.330
 very little to do with the book but still 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.030
 so I recommend them a lot 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.690
 hours that will last are very good going to 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.430
 have a lot of suspense action since a 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.830
 comparison of the book that are like a 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.240
 25 stories here are going to focus on a 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.759
 single character in brad pitt 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.500
 former agent of the United Nations who 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.610
 is with your family when the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.979
 infection and from there it's going to be sent to a 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.199
 aircraft carrier by his boss to receive 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.840
 orders to organize with a team and 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.960
 search for cures infection in the world 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.849
 as I said in an earlier video's 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.380
 zombies in the movie are the style of 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.009
 extermination and the dawn of the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.470
 dead of the remake they run tag lean 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.690
 it looks like a football game and 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.880
 compared to the novel there are more 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.180
 quiet zombies walking style 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.770
 dead ' 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.289
 even though the movie is not going to 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.930
 I do not seem like a book, I recommend them 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.610
 quite if they have not read the book and already 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.940
 they saw the movie I recommend them 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.090
 pretty much see reading the book already 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.159
 that they will give you step by step as to 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.409
 start from this infection from the 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:19.330
 patient 0 until when governments 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.710
 they are recovering the city 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.389
 even when the US is going to start sending 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.789
 his soldiers to other countries to 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.670
 train them to help them recover 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.250
 their very 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.560
 countries themselves as I walked 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.830
 reading are going to be movie trilogy 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.170
 of world war z and if they do I do not know 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.360
 what they are going to get but 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.940
 something that they will have to put in because 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.030
 they mention enough in the novel they do 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.690
 quite emphasis apart that's the war 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.240
 civilian also to that the country of 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.130
 Cuba that little island at the end of 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.410
 war is going to be the only country that 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.270
 he survived that while all the countries 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.460
 are rebuilding is going to be the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.950
 only country that was not affected at all 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.440
 by the war on the contrary its economy 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.290
 will grow the most important banks 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.960
 they will be there without a doubt it is a very good 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.000
 book because not only is it going to 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.400
 be written without thinking it like in 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.530
 some movies do max brooks 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.800
 to interview army charges 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.440
 to build on the plans that could 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.480
 happen in some zombie apocalypse 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.550
 Well, this is all I hope there is 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.920
 served something and if they already saw the 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.470
