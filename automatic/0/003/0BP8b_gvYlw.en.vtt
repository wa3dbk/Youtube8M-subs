is you have a complete view over the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
is you have a complete view over the
zombies<00:01:06.479> i'm<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.990> sure<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.320> he<00:01:07.409> actually

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
zombies i'm not sure if he actually

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
zombies i'm not sure if he actually
begins<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.159> shoot<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:10.200> i

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
begins to shoot them here or not but i

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.840 
begins to shoot them here or not but i
believe<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.799> actually<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.310> through<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
believe you can actually get through to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
believe you can actually get through to
the<00:01:11.970> zombies<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.250> essentially

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the zombies and so that is essentially

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.039 
the zombies and so that is essentially
the<00:01:14.729> glitch<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.390> sure<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.600> try<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> out

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the glitch so make sure you try it out
