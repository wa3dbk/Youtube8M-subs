00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 hey 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:20.970
 I wonder if it was decided 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:26.189
 I took it and took it, but when I go home and look at it, I often see something unusual 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.690
 After all I understand well that I have to clarify my image first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.730
 Was 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.220
 Ummm 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:39.070
 Let me tell my friends on the roof last night 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:42.130
 new I systematically empirical to 7 in fishing gear I had been taught in the rest 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.370
 It was very helpful to have you study 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.500
 Public next received 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:55.260
 I see the composition of this is bought N guy is my own that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.210
 Become of similar photos even taking pictures until now I did not well understood anything had a brush 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.920
 Since it was often say selling 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.790
 And tell me how to say Bailly should use the wind to say if there is in fact what kind of composition 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.360
 Than 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.760
 Aso maybe that one 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.960
 If I think it is important to wear it, I want to do my best to get it 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.090
 thought 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.360
 Because I only see what I want to shoot, it will be a medium-time pose 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.440
 This time too 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.610
 It's a little bad balance but is the table Photos 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.140
 This is the correct picture 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.280
 Everyone on Ikeno or raised deliberately here 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.590
 It will be a natural pose by widening the open eye 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.300
 Please say that you take a step on this ratio 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.290
 This is also a way of thinking of the subtraction of the pose 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.310
 There is an intention in composition 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:46.780
 It is still easier to balance if you are aware of flowers and voices with a little triangle 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.780
 Kamimei Torii is a good feeling 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 Yeah I wonder of the thing that has been said to be a gondola line the so-called march princess 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 I will go to such places on this 3 divisions what will be the point 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.690
 These are not one by one, but they are combined to make a good composition. 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:12.800
 Interview subject Let's say that you become drunk Nde Kore 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.800
 You always whole of the balance you can see that Tteyuu try to take what the other by another at all 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.520
 First chop basic flame or is something like this 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 Is it a major person 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.140
 Another flight of that that focus is on top 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.140
 I say good around here 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.670
 If you put it in 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.940
 This is the first picture of the cake taken by the student 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.560
 It is good at all 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.220
 Angularly 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 It looks delicious 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.110
 If the day goes down, it will feel like it will come alive again 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:56.070
 But it but also usually nurtured O'by 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.070
 Such is the feeling When I arranged to be Well's at'm feeling is greedy and Chow mix 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.569
 To avoid suffering from composition 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.569
 3 steps 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.350
 I was conscious 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.510
 Almost nothing 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.980
 Than also take naturally without that course is aware from the time a single become entirely different 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.880
 Hmm 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.300
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.800
 me 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.800
 Buch minute 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.960
 Yes yes
