00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.529
 welcome to the sports center am 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.750
 Maspernplatz today for the game of the finches 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.629
 what 's up against the bg of godingen 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.680
 you are the mentor of the bg gÃ¶ttingen 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.289
 that's what they promise of this 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.539
 play well today we have neat 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.580
 Fans brought I hope it will be one 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.199
 close game with a positive outcome 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.150
 for us 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:30.050
 how do you see the baskets this year? 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.260
 yes the baskets started quite well 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.190
 actually then was the choice of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.740
 playmakers 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.810
 where was obligated after that yes what 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.490
 it was to be expected that they play and 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.640
 I think they'll be safe, too 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.710
 be in the play off at the end of the season 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.960
 Christoph, what does it look like? 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.730
 you expect for the game yes I expect 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.530
 first, of course that there is a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.420
 exciting high class fast game 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.680
 will be in the gameplay of both teams 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.270
 expect that many points 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.430
 it quickly falls to the place 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.840
 and down we defend 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.610
 maybe not see as much as today 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.320
 in other games we let ourselves 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.689
 Surprise but it will be safe 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.700
 join again in the partial 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.479
 Playing classic is that I hope 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.979
 at least 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.100
 so now we have the pressure 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.229
 co-trainer uli next to oli as sees 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.609
 what are the expectations for that? 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.869
 play and what about me from the team 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.630
 the anticipation is really this time 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.829
 Great will be a great backdrop and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.039
 I think that is very exciting and 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.569
 attractive player for the spectators 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.270
 also for the first time ours 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.940
 squad with the new professionals really fit 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.620
 and completely and therefore 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.000
 We are also very happy I play 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.650
 I am personally happy and I play 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.720
 believe it will be for everyone involved 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.720
 really a super awesome encounter 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 the ten points before half-time would be 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.270
 as before 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.130
 very well i honestly said so 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.830
 not expecting anything before that 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.370
 after the first hearing that was us 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.810
 almost always the other way around 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.450
 but I expect a tight box yes 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.330
 Unfortunately , we are not in the bag today 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.650
 that can give hope that too 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.760
 works a second part because the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.040
 last five minutes of the second 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.080
 was more intense, quarter the defense 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.620
 already from us and we give the hope 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.620
 on 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.720
 opposite 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.339
 over strong first half in the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.580
 second half was divine faith 

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:54.800
 I am very strong at what it has 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.139
 that he did not work out in the end 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.150
 has at us at the losses or 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.529
 where I pass my ball losses 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.089
 but you can only put that away again 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.039
 with any good ones 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.210
 defense action does not have 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.289
 works we have the hot ones 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.839
 found people like we did in the first one 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.430
 half time and think that was 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.749
 the general problem in general 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.099
 the second half time we did they 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.349
 not at all clear with the 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.270
 penetration what we first had the 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.159
 a bit of a joke that got us in the 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.629
 kept playing and yes I mean that 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.430
 were just in the second half one 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.589
 class better I have to admit 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.240
 I think that's what we do 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.620
 I dominated the first quarter 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.839
 that we have the first half unterm 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.659
 have dominated but I knew it was clear 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.729
 For that, godingen has too much quality yes 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.309
 too much experience and too much 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.080
 athletics on the field that's the way it is 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.939
 I'll just think that one time 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.099
 did you have the problem that we were not 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.169
 more not at all on the 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.240
 level further threw the first 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.639
 half-time the throw rate went down like 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.110
 was well above 50% first half and 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.580
 cause has made him the longer the game 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.219
 has always taken better and always 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.419
 defended aggressively more and more intense 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.669
 that is our throws were 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.349
 more difficult and many I say now 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.939
 the first half have fallen yet 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.709
 at the end then no longer fell 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.209
 on the other side we think 

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:11.860
 I also defended intensely though 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:11.860
 Gottingen called the big shots
