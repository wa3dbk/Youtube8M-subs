00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.840
 so I decided to come from now on 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 Let's slow 15% of the vacancies. 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.819
 for light coming from the public school 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:12.989
 in my opinion 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.419
 sixth should be taken is to charge 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.349
 it is true 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.619
 15% 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 we just deal with school itself 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.819
 injured 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.949
 it only 15% 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.750
 should have 15% of places for students that is high school in any 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.199
 this would have to rethink a private school 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.900
 of someone who stayed the whole time 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.750
 on solemnity 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.260
 at the end of the month 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.550
 and here for private school ' 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.920
 the logic I do not know that who has the conditions to give everything to act 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.540
 in Brazil, elementary education has been stopped at the secondary school 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.730
 inside for sinop super bowl 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.930
 the staff does not want to stop and until &amp; t is precisely because 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.910
 usually the best universities in Brazil are the public universities then 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 it should be that way when you're standing 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 60% of public education posts being higher 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.660
 the indices achieved high school progress also visible 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 I believe it would be 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.170
 we lost 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.710
 public universities would be abandoned by teachers for the good 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.070
 teachers who have 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 he decided to migrate private colleges because 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.909
 because with people who can afford to pay for home books 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.940
 all particular 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.030
 reserves may rise and teachers of the network the current and worse performance 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.660
 better than public school teachers that will not happen at least 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.190
 a few rounds and steven shafer then the suggestion that I can prove it on 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.250
 education 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.110
 100% the worker that 100% of the vacancies of the public higher education 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.330
 persons from the second degree 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.189
 also said in public thus the criterion of remedies 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.989
 there the person who studied the bc to inform which the victims were traveling 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.839
 showing why in any way to form the double owner of the team and 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:29.899
 improve 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:35.079
 she would have enough in payments and advertisements as consolation pereira 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.969
 because today often studying 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.199
 to act without conditions to pay in the event of financial difficulties 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.619
 products 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.429
 and they spend fortunes as a consequence can not increase 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.249
 much our life 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.589
 so if I were driving to charge for the incursions of the body 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.929
 hire good teachers then 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.309
 I think that way you need to eat
