very<00:00:21.420> thick<00:00:21.720> bondo<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.340> found<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.180> eBay

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
very thick bondo so I found this on eBay

in<00:00:25.980> Montana<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> bought<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> very<00:00:28.080> very

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in Montana and bought it very very

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.250 
in Montana and bought it very very
cheaply<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.039> brought<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.900> once<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.050> broke

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
cheaply and brought it up once I broke

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.870 
cheaply and brought it up once I broke
it<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.650> begin<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> realize<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.520> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it down I begin to realize that this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
it down I begin to realize that this
vehicle<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.390> actually<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:34.920> good

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
vehicle is actually in a very good

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.240 
vehicle is actually in a very good
condition<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:36.239> terms<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.870> body<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.410> frame<00:00:37.800> but

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
condition in terms of body and frame but

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000 
condition in terms of body and frame but
it<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.399> missing<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> lot<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> pieces<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it was missing a lot of pieces so I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.979 
it was missing a lot of pieces so I
broke<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.149> realized<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
broke it down and then realized that I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
broke it down and then realized that I
want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.440> something<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:44.070> fancy<00:00:44.309> with

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
which I broke down realized that it was

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920 
which I broke down realized that it was
something<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.059> could<00:01:00.239> work<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
something that I could work with and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.349 
something that I could work with and
then<00:01:01.710> went<00:01:01.980> ahead<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> bought<00:01:02.760> myself<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
then went ahead and bought myself a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.460 
then went ahead and bought myself a
Camaros<00:01:04.080> 78<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:06.030> I've<00:01:06.720> gone<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> married<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
Camaros 78 and I've gone and married the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.850 
Camaros 78 and I've gone and married the
two<00:01:07.619> frames<00:01:07.979> together<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.939> did<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
two frames together how did I do that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.600 
two frames together how did I do that
basically<00:01:10.860> I've<00:01:11.549> gone<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.450> cut<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> frame

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
basically I've gone and cut the frame

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.240 
basically I've gone and cut the frame
right<00:01:15.000> over<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> pulled<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
right over there and pulled in the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
right over there and pulled in the
Camaro<00:01:17.580> frame<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> did<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> same<00:01:18.540> thing<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Camaro frame and did the same thing and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
Camaro frame and did the same thing and
put<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.350> together<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.610> simple<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
put the two together not so simple this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.410 
put the two together not so simple this
is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.960> old<00:01:22.290> l110<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.009> understand<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.119> see

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
is the old l110 and understand you see

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
is the old l110 and understand you see
notice<00:01:25.020> how<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> 110<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> narrower<00:01:28.799> than<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
notice how the 110 is narrower than the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.319 
notice how the 110 is narrower than the
Camaro<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.259> had<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> cut<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.549> bend<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
Camaro so I had to cut this and bend the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.730 
Camaro so I had to cut this and bend the
frame<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.500> meet<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> l110<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:37.229> I'd<00:01:37.350> then

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
frame out to meet the l110 what I'd then

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.510 
frame out to meet the l110 what I'd then
did<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.540> cut<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> such<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.520> no

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
did was I cut this in such a way that no

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.330 
did was I cut this in such a way that no
cuts<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:42.150> clean<00:01:42.869> through<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.829> cut<00:01:44.100> goes

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
cuts all clean through this cut goes

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.210 
cuts all clean through this cut goes
down<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.229> cut<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> frame<00:01:46.979> up

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
down there and then I cut the frame up

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
down there and then I cut the frame up
to<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.430> point<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> cut<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> through<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
to this point and cut it through and the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350 
to this point and cut it through and the
same<00:01:49.740> back<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.030> back

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
same back here we go all the way back

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
same back here we go all the way back
here<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
here and as you can see right there I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.149 
here and as you can see right there I
cut<00:01:54.090> through<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> weld<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.500> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
cut through there and weld it there so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.100 
cut through there and weld it there so
that<00:01:56.189> all<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.759> cuts<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.240> staggered<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.930> one

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that all my cuts are staggered this one

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
that all my cuts are staggered this one
is<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.579> this<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.909> over<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
is over there this one is over here and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
is over there this one is over here and
this<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.530> done<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.549> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
this one done if you can see that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
this one done if you can see that
there's<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.329> through<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
there's one right through there and the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.550 
there's one right through there and the
one<00:02:04.710> underneath<00:02:05.009> also<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.850> staggered<00:02:06.560> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
one underneath also is staggered this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.309 
one underneath also is staggered this
makes<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.369> frame<00:02:08.640> obviously<00:02:09.209> very<00:02:09.569> resistant

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
makes the frame obviously very resistant

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.730 
makes the frame obviously very resistant
to<00:02:10.379> coming<00:02:10.649> apart

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
to coming apart

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
to coming apart
once<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.220> completed<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.240> went

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
once that was all completed I then went

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
once that was all completed I then went
ahead<00:02:15.570> my<00:02:15.930> box<00:02:16.260> digs<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> frame<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.790> as

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
ahead my box digs at the frame and as

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.400 
ahead my box digs at the frame and as
you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.150> see<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.450> boxed<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> heavy

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
you can see I boxed it with a heavy

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.280 
you can see I boxed it with a heavy
metal<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.070> same<00:02:20.310> die<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.750> same<00:02:21.990> gauge

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
metal the same die with the same gauge

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.990 
metal the same die with the same gauge
as<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.860> frame<00:02:25.160> obviously<00:02:26.160> everything<00:02:26.940> is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
as the frame obviously everything is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.240 
as the frame obviously everything is
done<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.990> tape<00:02:28.260> measure<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.010> all

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
done the tape measure and it all

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.650 
done the tape measure and it all
correspond<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.330> looks<00:02:30.570> pretty

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
correspond and it all looks pretty

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.110 
correspond and it all looks pretty
square<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.070> well<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.370> seems<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.820> square

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
square and well it seems to be square

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.850 
square and well it seems to be square
and<00:02:33.330> surfing<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.990> tape<00:02:34.200> measure<00:02:34.320> tells<00:02:34.710> me

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and surfing the tape measure tells me

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
and surfing the tape measure tells me
it's<00:02:35.010> square<00:02:35.370> I'll<00:02:35.940> stand<00:02:36.270> back<00:02:36.420> here<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.780> can

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's square I'll stand back here you can

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.810 
it's square I'll stand back here you can
get<00:02:37.050> an<00:02:37.470> idea<00:02:37.920> as<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> what<00:02:38.370> we're<00:02:38.520> dealing

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
get an idea as to what we're dealing

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.550 
get an idea as to what we're dealing
with

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
with

l110<00:02:40.700> camara<00:02:42.200> last<00:02:43.200> weekend<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.950> took<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.370> old

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
l110 camara last weekend I took the old

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.100 
l110 camara last weekend I took the old
transmission<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.420> Camaro<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.930> had<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
transmission of the Camaro and had a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.450 
transmission of the Camaro and had a
look<00:02:46.260> at<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.740> looked<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.070> very<00:02:47.250> good<00:02:47.400> shape

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
look at it and looked in very good shape

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.030 
look at it and looked in very good shape
so<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> proceeded<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.720> putting<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.470> shift<00:02:49.800> kit

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
so I proceeded in putting in a shift kit

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.100 
so I proceeded in putting in a shift kit
this<00:02:50.730> by<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> way<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.240> not<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.570> complicated

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
this by the way is not that complicated

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.720 
this by the way is not that complicated
if<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> right<00:02:53.190> tools<00:02:53.490> and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
if you have the right tools and

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.200 
if you have the right tools and
obviously<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.240> bit<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.570> time<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:56.400> motor<00:02:56.670> also

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
obviously a bit of time this motor also

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.290 
obviously a bit of time this motor also
is<00:02:57.390> not<00:02:57.630> from<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> Camaro<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.770> see

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
is not from the Camaro as you can see

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.360 
is not from the Camaro as you can see
it's<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.630> Vortech<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:03.150> an<00:03:03.270> ls1<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:05.220> should

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's a Vortech it's an ls1 and it should

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.030 
it's a Vortech it's an ls1 and it should
work<00:03:05.400> along<00:03:05.820> quite<00:03:06.450> nicely<00:03:06.740> other<00:03:07.740> than<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
work along quite nicely other than that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.850 
work along quite nicely other than that
everything<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.640> Camaro<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:10.080> springs<00:03:10.470> will

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
everything is Camaro the springs will

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.260 
everything is Camaro the springs will
everything<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> whole<00:03:11.400> front<00:03:11.670> end<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.910> Camaro

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
everything the whole front end is Camaro

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.250 
everything the whole front end is Camaro
I've<00:03:12.690> gone<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.110> replaced<00:03:13.290> everything<00:03:14.060> it's

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
I've gone and replaced everything it's

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.210 
I've gone and replaced everything it's
it's<00:03:16.260> kind<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.590> sickening<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.010> too<00:03:17.100> much

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
it's kind of sickening it's too much

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.100 
it's kind of sickening it's too much
money<00:03:17.370> I've<00:03:17.550> put<00:03:17.730> into<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:17.970> already<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:18.989> I'm

and thereafter
I<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.730> reckon<00:03:42.269> about<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.570> month<00:03:42.900> from<00:03:43.050> now<00:03:43.110> I'll

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
I I reckon about a month from now I'll

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.650 
I I reckon about a month from now I'll
probably<00:03:43.709> start<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.280> body<00:03:44.519> I'll<00:03:45.269> put<00:03:45.510> that

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
probably start on the body I'll put that

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.810 
probably start on the body I'll put that
in<00:03:45.920> hopefully<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.130> don't<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.580> cut

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
in hopefully I don't have to cut

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.370 
in hopefully I don't have to cut
anything<00:03:48.030> back<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.780> looks<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.260> might

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
anything back but it looks like I might

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.110 
anything back but it looks like I might
have<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.590> move<00:03:49.739> parts<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.400> firewall<00:03:50.880> back
