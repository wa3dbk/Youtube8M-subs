00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello the articles that we are looking at 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.839
 continuation are the pioneer hdj 500 that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.290
 I am currently selling in 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.610
 mercadolibre as you can see are from 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.619
 Red color 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.520
 and after which they explained a 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.869
 little its specifications the materials 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.800
 where they are built are 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 resistant materials 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.960
 the headphones come covered 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.960
 pads that allow 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.330
 a prolonged use for hours without 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.060
 bother in the ears like the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.870
 headband the upper part comes with 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.970
 pads 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 the right side 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.540
 as you can see the handset can give 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.030
 a 60 degree turn so they can be 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.740
 used 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.160
 by way of her 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.400
 These hearing aids come with two 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.239
 cables one of them has a length 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.610
 1 meter 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.649
 then for personal use to connect them 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.710
 on the cell phone to cut them in the 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.149
 sound equipment and the other cable comes 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:22.270
 extensor way of 3 meters to be 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.270
 used I would say in the cabin of a dj 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.680
 they are also accompanied by a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.759
 jack minijack converter to power 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.700
 connect it professionally mine 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.380
 It is silver but that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.710
 originally how I could show them 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.619
 here in the box is golden 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.899
 there's just this pair are the ones 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.000
 I am currently selling in 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.970
 mercadolibre and taught if they are 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.310
 completely new 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.930
 people tend to compare us a lot to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 plant the direct competition of these 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 hearing aids are doctor beats but 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.670
 after having made a comparison 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.400
 I'm going to tell you that the depth that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 give these headphones on bass and the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.990
 definition in high media is very 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 superior and have no point of 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.470
 comparison with the two doctors only 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.570
 what 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.820
 the doctor beats are very good 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.490
 positioned in the market and have done 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.530
 a great marketing job but in 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.310
 as to quality not only of sounds 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.480
 materials personally recommend 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.400
 these several days hdj 500 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 It goes without saying that within the range of 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.030
 the hdj 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.290
 the 500 are the lowest range because then 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.120
 there are the thousand hdj and the hj 2000 but 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.030
 Well for those who want to have comfort 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.080
 the light hearing aids and a large 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.790
 quality in them can not doubt in 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:01.300
 acquire facts these hdj 500 that give 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.650
 very good impression both visually 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.659
 as in the quality of its sound 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.760
 As a final point, I recommend that if 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.189
 they are going to offer in mercadolibre 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.400
 with responsibility that is all and many 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.400
 Thank you
