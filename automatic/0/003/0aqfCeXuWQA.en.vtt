sandpaper paper towel and the helmet and
I'll<00:00:09.240> start<00:00:09.480> showing<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:10.190> sometimes<00:00:12.530> you<00:00:13.530> can

I'll start showing you sometimes you can

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.240 
I'll start showing you sometimes you can
just<00:00:13.710> start<00:00:14.130> rubbing<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.680> masking

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
just start rubbing and this masking

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.090 
just start rubbing and this masking
fluid<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.140> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> come<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:19.770> off

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
fluid is just going to come right off

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.939 
fluid is just going to come right off
from<00:00:20.820> underneath<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.689> paint<00:00:27.740> all<00:00:28.740> right

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
from underneath the paint all right

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.780 
from underneath the paint all right
depending<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.679> well<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> paint's<00:00:32.219> dried

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.750 

depends<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> effect<00:00:36.469> also<00:00:37.469> how<00:00:38.129> thick<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
depends on the effect also how thick I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.690 
depends on the effect also how thick I
initially<00:00:39.270> put<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> masking<00:00:40.350> fluid<00:00:40.700> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
initially put on the masking fluid is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.889 
initially put on the masking fluid is
going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> help<00:00:42.180> determine<00:00:44.300> how<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.480> comes<00:00:45.690> out

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
going to help determine how it comes out

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.850 
going to help determine how it comes out
and<00:00:48.590> as<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:51.050> it's<00:00:52.050> masking<00:00:52.500> fluids

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and as you can see it's masking fluids

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.639 
and as you can see it's masking fluids
getting<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.219> really<00:00:53.789> nice<00:00:54.000> edge<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.500> make

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
getting a really nice edge here to make

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
getting a really nice edge here to make
it<00:00:55.770> look<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.219> been<00:00:56.309> scraped<00:00:56.789> which<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it look like it's been scraped which is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.010 
it look like it's been scraped which is
the<00:00:58.230> effect<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:59.480> wanted<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the effect I wanted to get out of the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.420 
the effect I wanted to get out of the
helmet<00:01:04.580> now<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.810> tricky<00:01:07.560> doing<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
helmet now it's a little tricky doing it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.810 
helmet now it's a little tricky doing it
with<00:01:08.790> latex<00:01:09.210> gloves<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.950> obviously<00:01:13.820> because

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
with latex gloves on obviously because

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.370 
with latex gloves on obviously because
it<00:01:14.970> tends<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> stick<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.369> worth<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
it tends to stick but it's worth it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
it tends to stick but it's worth it
because<00:01:19.610> again<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.939> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.479> able<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> go

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because again I want to be able to go

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.670 
because again I want to be able to go
back<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.450> paint<00:01:24.450> over<00:01:24.720> again<00:01:24.979> okay<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:27.680> this

back and paint over again okay this this
is<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.130> ears<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.820> trying

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is one of those ears you see I'm trying

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
there's a couple tricks we can do

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.120 
there's a couple tricks we can do
toothpick<00:01:35.900> always<00:01:36.900> good<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:37.920> where

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
toothpick always good if you know where

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
toothpick always good if you know where
you're<00:01:38.250> rubbing<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.970> once<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you're rubbing it and once you get it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
you're rubbing it and once you get it
started<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.170> tends<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.970> stick<00:01:44.970> together

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
started it tends to stick together

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.490 
started it tends to stick together
pretty<00:01:45.570> well<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:47.040> come<00:01:47.369> off<00:01:48.290> some<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
pretty well and come off some of the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.859 
pretty well and come off some of the
thin<00:01:49.829> areas<00:01:50.369> where<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> put<00:01:51.149> latex<00:01:51.479> down<00:01:51.750> are

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
thin areas where I put latex down are

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
thin areas where I put latex down are
gonna<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.320> difficult<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:53.009> what

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
gonna be really difficult that's what

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.999 
gonna be really difficult that's what
the<00:01:53.280> sandpaper<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.409> you'll

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
be able to see that effect pretty well

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.760 
be able to see that effect pretty well
on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> brow

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
on the brow

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.999 
on the brow
yeah<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.560> I'll<00:02:04.560> try<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
yeah you can see now I'll try to do a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.400 
yeah you can see now I'll try to do a
little<00:02:05.189> close-up<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:07.640> back<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:09.080> see<00:02:10.080> some<00:02:10.319> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
little close-up here back up see some of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
little close-up here back up see some of
the<00:02:10.530> nice<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.459> layered<00:02:11.700> effects<00:02:12.090> you're

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the nice the layered effects you're

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.960 
the nice the layered effects you're
gonna<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:13.430> you're<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.550> gonna<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.790> able<00:02:14.849> to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
gonna get you're not gonna be able to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.570 
gonna get you're not gonna be able to
feel<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.440> too<00:02:16.440> much<00:02:16.709> at<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.099> point<00:02:17.220> just

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
feel it too much at this point just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.000 
feel it too much at this point just
because<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.150> only<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.569> layer<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.959> paint<00:02:19.230> but

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
because it's only one layer of paint but

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880 
because it's only one layer of paint but
you<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:20.610> nice<00:02:21.200> ripple<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.319> edge

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
you get this nice ripple to edge

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.920 
you get this nice ripple to edge
it<00:02:23.099> doesn't<00:02:23.400> look<00:02:23.459> blobby<00:02:23.819> there's<00:02:24.660> still

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
it doesn't look blobby there's still

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.830 
it doesn't look blobby there's still
some<00:02:25.170> sections<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.730> missed<00:02:27.030> when<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.690> was

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
some sections that I missed when I was

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.210 
some sections that I missed when I was
going<00:02:27.989> through<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.380> latex<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.069> just

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
going through the latex and that's just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.710 
going through the latex and that's just
all<00:02:29.340> good<00:02:29.550> because<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.730> leaves<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.330> little

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
all good because that leaves a little

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
all good because that leaves a little
black<00:02:31.110> bits<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.430> same<00:02:32.670> thing<00:02:32.849> will<00:02:32.970> happen

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
black bits the same thing will happen

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.030 
black bits the same thing will happen
again<00:02:33.420> when<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.959> next<00:02:34.110> layer<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.709> put

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
again when I do the next layer and put

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.199 
again when I do the next layer and put
the<00:02:35.130> white<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.970> I'll<00:02:38.970> give<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.150> a

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
the white on it so I'll give you a

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.410 
the white on it so I'll give you a
little<00:02:39.390> example<00:02:39.530> just<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.739> use<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> wet<00:02:42.150> sand

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
little example just I use a wet sand

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.330 
little example just I use a wet sand
paper<00:02:45.590> water<00:02:46.610> 600<00:02:47.610> grit<00:02:47.700> sandpaper<00:02:49.340> slight

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
paper water 600 grit sandpaper slight

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.479 
paper water 600 grit sandpaper slight
wedding<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.920> very<00:02:53.160> very<00:02:54.000> gently<00:02:55.489> go

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
wedding and it's very very gently go

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.880 
wedding and it's very very gently go
over<00:02:56.519> it<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.290> want<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> put<00:03:01.590> too<00:03:01.739> much

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
over it you don't want to put too much

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.600 
over it you don't want to put too much
pressure<00:03:02.160> on<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.299> boom<00:03:04.080> catches<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.190> latex

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
pressure on and boom catches the latex

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:21.180 
pressure on and boom catches the latex
off<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.359> comes

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.600 

so<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.440> said<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.770> thinner<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.220> latex

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
so like I said the thinner the latex

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.940 
so like I said the thinner the latex
coat<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:27.200> more<00:03:27.440> difficult<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:28.070> becomes<00:03:29.950> you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
coat the more difficult this becomes you

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.980 
coat the more difficult this becomes you
have<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.160> be<00:03:31.280> very<00:03:31.550> careful<00:03:32.210> if<00:03:32.780> you're<00:03:32.960> going

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
have to be very careful if you're going

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.270 
have to be very careful if you're going
over<00:03:35.440> not<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.590> bear<00:03:36.740> down<00:03:36.890> too<00:03:37.160> hard<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:40.100> more

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
over not to bear down too hard the more

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.940 
over not to bear down too hard the more
you<00:03:40.430> can<00:03:40.520> just<00:03:40.930> get<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.050> latex<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.620> come<00:03:42.800> off

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
you can just get the latex to come off

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.010 
you can just get the latex to come off
on<00:03:43.160> its<00:03:43.280> own<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:47.390> better<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.810> tends

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
on its own like that the better it tends

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.180 
on its own like that the better it tends
to<00:03:48.140> look<00:03:53.530> one<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.680> other<00:03:54.830> good<00:03:55.010> things

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
to look one of the other good things

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.770 
to look one of the other good things
about<00:03:55.310> going<00:03:55.730> over<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.060> with<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.270> sandpaper

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
about going over it with the sandpaper

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.420 
about going over it with the sandpaper
is<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:59.540> can<00:03:59.690> kind<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.960> see<00:04:03.280> still<00:04:04.280> have

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
is that you can kind of see still have

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.070 
is that you can kind of see still have
that<00:04:04.550> nice<00:04:04.790> edge<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.420> it's<00:04:05.540> smooth<00:04:05.810> things

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
that nice edge but it's smooth things

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.380 
that nice edge but it's smooth things
out<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.590> little<00:04:06.800> bit<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.460> gets<00:04:08.120> rid<00:04:08.300> of

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
out just a little bit and gets rid of

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.240 
out just a little bit and gets rid of
some<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> excess<00:04:09.080> paint<00:04:09.410> that's<00:04:10.040> gonna

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
some of the excess paint that's gonna

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.730 
some of the excess paint that's gonna
flake<00:04:10.550> away<00:04:10.730> now<00:04:11.510> that's<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:12.350> becomes

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
flake away now that's that becomes

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.410 
flake away now that's that becomes
important<00:04:13.280> because<00:04:14.290> what's<00:04:15.290> gonna<00:04:15.440> happen<00:04:15.860> is

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
important because what's gonna happen is

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.740 
important because what's gonna happen is
once<00:04:17.420> I'm<00:04:17.600> done<00:04:17.720> with<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:18.080> stage<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.690> you

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
once I'm done with this stage and you

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.950 
once I'm done with this stage and you
get<00:04:21.590> rid<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.730> latex<00:04:23.150> I'm<00:04:23.540> gonna<00:04:23.720> have<00:04:23.870> to

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
get rid of the latex I'm gonna have to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.240 
get rid of the latex I'm gonna have to
let<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.140> draw<00:04:24.440> from<00:04:24.650> where<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:24.920> gonna<00:04:25.010> wet

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
let it draw from where it's gonna wet

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.770 
let it draw from where it's gonna wet
I'll<00:04:25.430> dampen<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.850> down<00:04:25.970> with<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.330> towel<00:04:26.540> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
I'll dampen it down with the towel and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.300 
I'll dampen it down with the towel and
go<00:04:26.930> back<00:04:27.110> over<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.440> with<00:04:27.500> another<00:04:27.830> alcohol

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
go back over it with another alcohol

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.390 
go back over it with another alcohol
wipe<00:04:28.810> but<00:04:29.810> all<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.800> area<00:04:31.070> that's<00:04:31.280> been

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
wipe but all this area that's been

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.790 
wipe but all this area that's been
masked<00:04:31.760> off<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.210> gonna<00:04:32.570> get<00:04:32.690> remastered<00:04:33.530> again

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
masked off is gonna get remastered again

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.659 
masked off is gonna get remastered again
for<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.460> next<00:04:34.700> layer<00:04:34.880> of<00:04:35.030> paint<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.419> goes<00:04:35.540> on

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
for the next layer of paint that goes on

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.430 
for the next layer of paint that goes on
but<00:04:37.669> like<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.360> said<00:04:38.419> this<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:38.780> just<00:04:38.810> one<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.290> the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
but like I said this is just one of the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.920 
but like I said this is just one of the
little<00:04:39.980> process<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.730> time-consuming<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.810> go

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
little process is time-consuming to go

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.140 
little process is time-consuming to go
back<00:04:42.110> over<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.280> why<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.460> put<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.910> clear

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
back over this is why I put the clear

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.640 
back over this is why I put the clear
coat<00:04:44.390> layers<00:04:44.600> down<00:04:44.840> because<00:04:45.169> as<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.350> can<00:04:45.500> see

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
coat layers down because as you can see

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.770 
coat layers down because as you can see
I'm<00:04:45.740> using<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:46.100> sandpaper<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.390> get<00:04:47.570> some

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
I'm using the sandpaper and to get some

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.430 
I'm using the sandpaper and to get some
of<00:04:47.870> these<00:04:47.930> edges<00:04:48.440> I'm<00:04:48.650> having<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.100> rub<00:04:49.370> over

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
of these edges I'm having to rub over

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.740 
of these edges I'm having to rub over
the<00:04:51.440> metal<00:04:51.650> area<00:04:52.030> with<00:04:53.030> those<00:04:53.210> layers<00:04:53.450> of

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
the metal area with those layers of

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.750 
the metal area with those layers of
clear<00:04:53.990> coat<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.380> extra<00:04:54.680> layers<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:55.070> metallic

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
clear coat and extra layers of metallic

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.790 
clear coat and extra layers of metallic
paint<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.060> put<00:04:56.270> down<00:04:56.450> even<00:04:57.080> if<00:04:57.169> I<00:04:57.260> do<00:04:57.320> happen<00:04:57.650> to

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
paint I put down even if I do happen to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.680 
paint I put down even if I do happen to
rub<00:04:58.100> through<00:04:58.520> you're<00:04:59.060> not<00:04:59.210> going<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.450> get<00:04:59.540> down

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
rub through you're not going to get down

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.690 
rub through you're not going to get down
to<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.380> primer<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.130> you're<00:05:01.220> certainly<00:05:01.550> not

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
to the primer and you're certainly not

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.130 
to the primer and you're certainly not
going<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.970> get<00:05:02.090> down<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.450> fiberglass<00:05:02.750> base

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
going to get down to the fiberglass base

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.190 
going to get down to the fiberglass base
of<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.410> helmet<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:05.240> keep<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.900> video<00:05:06.050> short

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
of the helmet so keep the video short

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.780 
of the helmet so keep the video short
because<00:05:06.650> I'm<00:05:06.740> having<00:05:06.950> huge<00:05:07.370> problems<00:05:07.760> with

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
because I'm having huge problems with

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.990 
because I'm having huge problems with

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
the uploads get an idea of how it's

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.340 
the uploads get an idea of how it's
gonna<00:05:11.060> work<00:05:11.180> I'm<00:05:11.510> gonna<00:05:11.660> do<00:05:11.810> just<00:05:11.960> continue
