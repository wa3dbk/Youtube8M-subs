there's really no issues what I've done

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.700 
there's really no issues what I've done
is<00:00:33.239> made<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:35.329> recording<00:00:38.899> just<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.170> hear

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
is made a recording just to try to hear

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340 
is made a recording just to try to hear
if<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.399> sort<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.239> distortion<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:42.960> some<00:00:43.170> sort

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
if it's sort of distortion or some sort

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
if it's sort of distortion or some sort
of<00:00:43.410> vibrating<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> earpiece<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.730> turn<00:00:47.730> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of vibrating in the earpiece I turn this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.990 
of vibrating in the earpiece I turn this
write-up<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.390> speaker<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> sounds<00:00:49.079> fine<00:00:50.000> maybe

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
write-up on speaker it sounds fine maybe

the<00:00:52.530> earpiece<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> something<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
the earpiece but there is something that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.869 
the earpiece but there is something that
from<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> term<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.579> sounds

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
from the term is up so that all sounds

from the term is up so that all sounds
five<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> pizza<00:01:01.190> touch<00:01:02.190> me<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.640> away<00:01:07.460> now

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
five to the pizza touch me go away now

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.810 
five to the pizza touch me go away now
there<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.409> obviously<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.860> noise<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.610> from

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
there is obviously the noise going from

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.080 
there is obviously the noise going from
now<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.090> quite<00:01:12.420> high<00:01:12.689> yeah<00:01:13.140> pitch<00:01:13.560> night<00:01:14.090> with

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
with this repair what has actually

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.750 
with this repair what has actually
happened<00:02:19.240> I've<00:02:19.840> taken<00:02:20.110> out<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.760> digitizer

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
happened I've taken out the digitizer

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.290 
happened I've taken out the digitizer
off<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.770> mid-frame<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.310> reason<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:24.880> is

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
off the mid-frame the reason for that is

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.500 
off the mid-frame the reason for that is
that<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.920> clips<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.870> metal<00:02:29.410> bracket<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
that the clips on the metal bracket that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.850 
that the clips on the metal bracket that
here<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.950> grip<00:02:37.770> sort<00:02:38.770> of

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
here here and here they grip sort of

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.270 
here here and here they grip sort of
this<00:02:39.070> side<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.690> mid-frame<00:02:41.290> there<00:02:41.800> there

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
this side of the mid-frame there there

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.480 
this side of the mid-frame there there
and<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:43.600> little<00:02:43.810> slip<00:02:44.170> there<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:45.190> much

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
and that little slip there it's much

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.160 
and that little slip there it's much
much<00:02:45.670> easier<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:46.240> just<00:02:46.390> push<00:02:46.420> them<00:02:46.750> out<00:02:46.840> from

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
much easier to just push them out from

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.430 
much easier to just push them out from
this<00:02:47.440> side<00:02:47.800> then<00:02:48.310> trying<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.880> pull<00:02:49.090> them<00:02:49.270> out

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
this side then trying to pull them out

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.130 
this side then trying to pull them out
potentially<00:02:50.440> causing<00:02:50.650> damage<00:02:51.190> from<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.400> back

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
potentially causing damage from the back

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.390 
potentially causing damage from the back
so<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:53.290> I've<00:02:53.380> done<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.950> came<00:02:54.130> out<00:02:54.220> nice

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
so now I've done that it came out nice

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.330 
so now I've done that it came out nice
and<00:02:54.460> easily<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:56.050> component<00:02:56.920> here<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and easily this component here is the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.310 
and easily this component here is the
earpiece<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.720> be<00:02:58.840> taken<00:02:59.200> out

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
earpiece that I'm going to be taken out

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.590 
earpiece that I'm going to be taken out
and<00:02:59.350> put<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.740> in<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.950> wanted<00:03:00.310> what<00:03:01.150> happens

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
and put it in you wanted what happens

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.700 
and put it in you wanted what happens
with<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.080> way<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.380> works<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.280> see

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
with this the way it works if you see

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.620 
with this the way it works if you see
there<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.860> two<00:03:06.010> kind<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.370> gold<00:03:06.970> colored

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
there the two kind of gold colored

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.060 
there the two kind of gold colored
contacts<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.290> about<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> center<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
contacts in about the center of the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.520 
contacts in about the center of the
screen<00:03:09.250> now<00:03:09.520> they<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.700> stick<00:03:10.120> up<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.630> then

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
screen now they just stick up and then

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.760 
screen now they just stick up and then
they<00:03:11.740> press<00:03:12.480> against<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> two<00:03:13.900> gold<00:03:14.230> areas

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
they press against the two gold areas

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.810 
they press against the two gold areas
there<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:16.209> phone<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:18.220> circuit

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
there on the phone and this circuit

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.900 
there on the phone and this circuit
passes<00:03:19.240> the<00:03:19.360> signal<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:21.310> earpiece<00:03:21.880> and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
passes the signal to the earpiece and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.820 
passes the signal to the earpiece and
then<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.330> hear<00:03:22.510> what<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.810> hear<00:03:23.020> when<00:03:23.230> you're

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
then you hear what you hear when you're

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.120 
then you hear what you hear when you're
talking<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.220> someone<00:03:24.400> on<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.610> phone<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:26.130> it's

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
talking to someone on the phone so it's

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.260 
talking to someone on the phone so it's
going<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.310> be<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.580> that<00:03:27.820> gets<00:03:27.970> replaced

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
going to be that that gets replaced

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.900 
going to be that that gets replaced

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
make a point that there is a wrong way

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.199 
make a point that there is a wrong way
and<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.800> right<00:04:14.830> way<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.610> piece<00:04:15.820> can<00:04:16.030> go

and a right way that this a piece can go
in<00:04:16.390> if<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:18.489> look<00:04:18.609> at<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.730> actual<00:04:18.940> contacts

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
in if you look at the actual contacts

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.969 
in if you look at the actual contacts
they<00:04:19.660> can<00:04:19.810> open<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.049> kind<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.320> pointing<00:04:20.680> down

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
they can open the kind of pointing down

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.790 
they can open the kind of pointing down
towards<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.520> bottom<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> phone

it's going to be getting clipped back

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
it's going to be getting clipped back
down<00:04:54.810> just<00:04:55.810> being<00:04:56.050> careful<00:04:56.259> of<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.650> new

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.820 

now<00:05:49.060> I'm<00:05:49.510> hoping<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.110> can<00:05:50.230> hear<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:51.810> over

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
now I'm hoping you can hear that over

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.000 
now I'm hoping you can hear that over
the<00:05:54.330> movie<00:05:56.940> but<00:05:57.940> having<00:05:58.180> an<00:05:58.270> exterior<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:59.620> does

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
the movie but having an exterior it does

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.960 
the movie but having an exterior it does
sound<00:06:00.340> a<00:06:00.490> lot<00:06:00.700> lot<00:06:00.940> smoother<00:06:02.820> so<00:06:03.820> it<00:06:03.940> looks

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
sound a lot lot smoother so it looks

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.460 
sound a lot lot smoother so it looks
like<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:06.250> old<00:06:06.730> ear<00:06:07.330> piece<00:06:07.660> itself<00:06:08.080> here

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
like the old ear piece itself here

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.620 
like the old ear piece itself here
looking<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.460> be<00:06:09.550> a<00:06:09.580> dummies<00:06:09.880> like<00:06:10.060> I<00:06:10.090> say<00:06:10.390> I

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
looking to be a dummies like I say I

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.180 
looking to be a dummies like I say I
just<00:06:11.200> sound<00:06:11.740> like<00:06:12.310> that<00:06:12.910> may<00:06:13.120> be<00:06:13.180> worn<00:06:13.480> out

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
just sound like that may be worn out

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.730 
just sound like that may be worn out
similar<00:06:15.190> to<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:16.180> way<00:06:16.330> a<00:06:16.360> speaker<00:06:17.080> might<00:06:17.380> blow

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
similar to the way a speaker might blow

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.220 
similar to the way a speaker might blow
for<00:06:18.670> example<00:06:19.150> if<00:06:19.470> it's<00:06:20.470> given<00:06:20.800> too<00:06:21.220> much<00:06:22.230> sort

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
for example if it's given too much sort

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.020 
for example if it's given too much sort
of<00:06:23.320> power<00:06:23.500> it'll<00:06:24.370> blow<00:06:24.550> and<00:06:24.700> become<00:06:24.910> too

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
of power it'll blow and become too

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.300 
of power it'll blow and become too
started<00:06:25.510> but<00:06:26.050> this<00:06:26.140> does<00:06:26.410> sound<00:06:26.590> much<00:06:26.890> much

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
started but this does sound much much

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.830 
started but this does sound much much
smoother<00:06:29.400> like<00:06:30.400> I<00:06:30.430> hope<00:06:31.120> you<00:06:31.330> can<00:06:31.480> hear<00:06:31.630> that

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
smoother like I hope you can hear that

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.100 
smoother like I hope you can hear that
over<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.260> movie<00:06:33.150> possibly<00:06:34.150> compared<00:06:34.600> to<00:06:34.900> an

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
over the movie possibly compared to an

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.430 
over the movie possibly compared to an
earlier<00:06:35.410> part<00:06:35.710> of<00:06:35.890> this<00:06:35.950> movie<00:06:36.400> when<00:06:36.700> the<00:06:36.850> old

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
earlier part of this movie when the old

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.070 
earlier part of this movie when the old
earphone<00:06:38.440> was<00:06:38.650> it<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:40.210> it<00:06:40.360> sounded<00:06:40.660> much<00:06:40.840> much

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
earphone was it and it sounded much much

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.190 
earphone was it and it sounded much much
different<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.880> that's<00:06:43.060> good<00:06:43.300> I'm<00:06:43.540> quite

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
different so that's good I'm quite

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.170 
different so that's good I'm quite
pleased<00:06:44.440> with<00:06:44.470> that<00:06:44.650> it's<00:06:44.860> a<00:06:44.920> lot<00:06:45.250> smoother<00:06:45.820> so

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
pleased with that it's a lot smoother so

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.630 
pleased with that it's a lot smoother so
that's<00:06:46.390> that<00:06:46.510> repair<00:06:46.840> complete<00:06:47.230> I<00:06:48.070> might<00:06:48.520> be

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
that's that repair complete I might be

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.130 
that's that repair complete I might be
doing<00:06:48.730> a<00:06:48.850> bit<00:06:49.000> more<00:06:49.030> testing<00:06:49.600> with<00:06:49.720> this<00:06:49.870> just

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
doing a bit more testing with this just

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.500 
doing a bit more testing with this just
to<00:06:50.260> make<00:06:50.410> sure<00:06:50.440> but<00:06:51.400> apart<00:06:51.880> from<00:06:51.970> that<00:06:52.150> that's

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
to make sure but apart from that that's

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.080 
to make sure but apart from that that's
all<00:06:52.690> ready<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:52.960> go
