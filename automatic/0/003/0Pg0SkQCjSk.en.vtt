do is take the ribbon and a hold the
flame<00:01:01.090> close<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.450> you'll<00:01:02.570> see<00:01:02.720> it<00:01:02.840> kind<00:01:03.079> of

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
flame close to it you'll see it kind of

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.109 
flame close to it you'll see it kind of
melt<00:01:03.350> down<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.620> little<00:01:03.890> bit<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.640> heat<00:01:04.879> feels

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
melt down a little bit that heat feels

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.469 
melt down a little bit that heat feels
the<00:01:05.390> ends<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:05.899> that<00:01:06.229> they<00:01:06.439> don't<00:01:06.590> fray<00:01:10.479> you

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
the ends so that they don't fray you

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.700 
the ends so that they don't fray you
don't<00:01:11.630> want<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.810> catch<00:01:11.899> it<00:01:12.079> on<00:01:12.170> fire<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.590> i

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
don't want to catch it on fire like i

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.020 
don't want to catch it on fire like i
did<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.100> other<00:01:13.280> one<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:13.640> if<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.790> do<00:01:14.000> just

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
did to that other one but if you do just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.990 
did to that other one but if you do just
pinch<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.509> out<00:01:14.659> it<00:01:14.780> won't<00:01:14.869> hurt<00:01:15.079> you<00:01:15.939> okay<00:01:16.939> so

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
pinch it out it won't hurt you okay so

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.429 
pinch it out it won't hurt you okay so

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
they're sealed that's enough to do two

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.899 
they're sealed that's enough to do two
different<00:01:18.619> barrettes<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.600> take<00:01:21.200> your<00:01:21.909> fabric

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
glue gun preheating here so that we can

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.899 
glue gun preheating here so that we can
apply<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:31.789> embellishment<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.729> so<00:01:34.729> take

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.339 
up I just kind of clamp it and get it
right<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.020> middle<00:02:13.780> make<00:02:14.780> sure<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.080> ribbon

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
right in the middle make sure the ribbon

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.809 
right in the middle make sure the ribbon
comes<00:02:15.530> all<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.709> way<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.160> back<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.580> that

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
comes all the way to the back like that

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.500 
comes all the way to the back like that
then<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.900> pinched<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> over

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
then I pinched it over

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.949 
then I pinched it over
and<00:02:20.709> squeeze<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.739> very<00:02:22.220> tightly<00:02:22.840> covering<00:02:23.840> it

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
and squeeze it very tightly covering it

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.589 
and squeeze it very tightly covering it
all<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.319> way<00:02:24.439> to<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.129> top<00:02:25.370> now<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.269> see<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
all the way to the top now you see the

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.720 
all the way to the top now you see the
end<00:02:26.750> starts<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.290> gap<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.680> little<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.400> me<00:02:28.519> I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
end starts the gap a little and to me I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.360 
end starts the gap a little and to me I
like<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.209> be<00:02:29.329> very<00:02:29.360> tight<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.049> flush<00:02:30.530> so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
like it to be very tight and flush so

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.449 
like it to be very tight and flush so
I'll<00:02:31.549> take<00:02:31.870> one<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.170> extras<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.920> just

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
I'll take one of the extras and just

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.979 
I'll take one of the extras and just
stick<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.909> that<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.329> hold<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.689> while<00:02:35.810> I'm

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989

pinch<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.370> into<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> end<00:02:40.970> like<00:02:41.629> this<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:43.430> may

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
pinch it into the end like this we may

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.130 
pinch it into the end like this we may
have<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.790> hold<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.180> there<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.629> second<00:02:45.019> to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
have to hold it there for a second to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.979 
have to hold it there for a second to
get<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.409> to<00:02:45.530> stay<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.420> if<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.540> doesn't<00:02:47.930> just

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
get it to stay and if it doesn't just

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.280 
get it to stay and if it doesn't just
make<00:02:48.319> sure<00:02:48.470> there's<00:02:48.709> enough<00:02:48.769> slack<00:02:50.170> when<00:02:51.170> you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
make sure there's enough slack when you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.619 
make sure there's enough slack when you
push<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.829> other<00:02:52.069> side<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.540> you

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
push it to the other side so that you

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.649 
push it to the other side so that you
can<00:02:53.780> come<00:02:53.900> back<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.200> work<00:02:54.349> on<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.590> some<00:02:54.739> more

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
can come back and work on it some more

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.819

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
give it a nice tight squeeze and if it

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.410 
give it a nice tight squeeze and if it
won't<00:03:00.500> stay<00:03:00.829> go<00:03:01.549> ahead<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.760> put<00:03:01.970> another<00:03:02.090> one

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
won't stay go ahead and put another one

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
part because you know if it does this it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080 
part because you know if it does this it
means<00:03:09.019> i<00:03:09.170> put<00:03:09.379> a<00:03:09.409> little<00:03:09.470> too<00:03:09.889> much<00:03:10.069> glue<00:03:10.370> there

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
means i put a little too much glue there
