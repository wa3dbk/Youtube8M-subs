that<00:02:52.320> great<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:53.160> close<00:02:53.520> obviously<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that great up close obviously and I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.990 
that great up close obviously and I
think<00:02:56.100> they've<00:02:56.220> done<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.340> good<00:02:56.520> job<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.700> gun

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
think they've done a good job of gun

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.540 
think they've done a good job of gun
balance<00:02:57.330> overall<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.080> ump45<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:59.190> was

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
balance overall like the ump45 I was

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.070 
balance overall like the ump45 I was
worried<00:02:59.760> about<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.060> being<00:03:00.180> overpowered<00:03:00.930> like

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
worried about it being overpowered like

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.020 
worried about it being overpowered like
it<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.530> modern<00:03:01.740> warfare<00:03:01.770> 2<00:03:02.130> not<00:03:02.730> even

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it was in modern warfare 2 not even

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.310 
it was in modern warfare 2 not even
close<00:03:03.210> they<00:03:04.020> did<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> good<00:03:04.440> job<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.710> really<00:03:05.460> just

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
close they did a good job of really just

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.900 
close they did a good job of really just
nerfing<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.440> more<00:03:07.710> or<00:03:07.830> less<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.460> making<00:03:08.820> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
nerfing it more or less but making it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
nerfing it more or less but making it
making<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.420> more<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:10.590> actually<00:03:11.010> an

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
making it more so that it's actually an

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.430 
making it more so that it's actually an
SMG<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:12.000> really<00:03:12.240> good<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.900> medium<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
SMG it's really good in the medium and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.070 
SMG it's really good in the medium and
close<00:03:13.650> distances<00:03:14.190> far<00:03:14.970> range<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.780> can't

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
close distances far range you can't

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.050 
close distances far range you can't
really<00:03:16.320> tonight<00:03:16.620> people<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.940> it's

really tonight people you can but it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.640 
really tonight people you can but it's
not<00:03:18.240> like<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.540> wasn't<00:03:18.810> modern<00:03:18.990> warfare<00:03:19.140> 2<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
not like it wasn't modern warfare 2 so

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.840 
not like it wasn't modern warfare 2 so
we<00:03:19.770> don't<00:03:19.890> have<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.070> worry<00:03:20.250> about<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.490> so

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
we don't have to worry about that so

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.460
