is<00:00:24.040> there<00:00:24.279> are<00:00:24.400> two<00:00:24.759> masses<00:00:25.360> half<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.349> it<00:00:26.439> is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
is there are two masses half of it is

attached to the gearbox with the clutch

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.120 
attached to the gearbox with the clutch
and<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.930> other<00:00:29.050> half<00:00:29.259> is<00:00:29.500> bolted<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:29.919> the

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
and the other half is bolted to the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.060 
and the other half is bolted to the
crankshaft<00:00:30.730> now<00:00:31.029> that<00:00:31.899> has<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.079> very<00:00:32.410> important

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
crankshaft now that has a very important

important<00:02:09.670> measurement<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.420> how<00:02:10.629> worn<00:02:10.959> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
important measurement on how worn the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.030 
important measurement on how worn the
flywheel<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:14.380> first<00:02:14.620> thing<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:14.860> need<00:02:15.010> to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
flywheel is the first thing we need to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.270 
flywheel is the first thing we need to
do<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.580> apply<00:02:15.760> some<00:02:16.000> visual<00:02:16.420> checks

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
do is to apply some visual checks

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.610 
do is to apply some visual checks
so<00:02:17.520> we're<00:02:17.700> looking<00:02:17.790> at<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> friction<00:02:18.720> face<00:02:18.960> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
so we're looking at the friction face to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.010 
so we're looking at the friction face to
see<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.010> only<00:02:20.160> deep<00:02:20.520> groove<00:02:21.020> scouring

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
see if it's only deep groove scouring

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.860 
see if it's only deep groove scouring
bluing<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.100> cracking<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.090> you've<00:02:24.420> got<00:02:24.600> any<00:02:24.780> of

the<00:03:12.090> DTI<00:03:13.430> first<00:03:14.430> thing<00:03:14.610> we<00:03:14.730> need<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
the DTI first thing we need to do is to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.170 
the DTI first thing we need to do is to
measure<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.709> gap<00:03:17.010> between<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.610> two<00:03:17.790> springs

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
measure the gap between the two springs

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.320 
measure the gap between the two springs
is<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.690> need<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.959> find<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:20.010> first<00:03:20.310> spring<00:03:20.640> so

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
is we need to find the first spring so

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.350 
is we need to find the first spring so
we<00:03:21.360> turn<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.870> anti-clockwise<00:03:22.970> until<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.150> can

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
we turn it anti-clockwise until we can

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.949 
we turn it anti-clockwise until we can
feel<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.019> spring<00:03:25.970> compress<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.420> allow<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
feel the spring compress it and allow it

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.850 
feel the spring compress it and allow it
to<00:03:27.989> return<00:03:29.510> now<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.570> zero<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.260> degree<00:03:31.620> gauge

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
to return now we zero the degree gauge

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.390 
to return now we zero the degree gauge
by<00:03:32.190> moving<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.640> pointer<00:03:34.040> then<00:03:35.040> we<00:03:35.160> want<00:03:35.310> to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
by moving the pointer then we want to

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.650 
by moving the pointer then we want to
turn<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.790> flywheel<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.360> opposite

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
turn the flywheel in the opposite

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.630 
turn the flywheel in the opposite
direction<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.650> find<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> other<00:03:38.220> edge<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.549> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.199 
direction to find the other edge of the
spring<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.840> turn<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> clockwise<00:03:41.030> now<00:03:42.030> on

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
spring so we turn it clockwise now on

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.030 
spring so we turn it clockwise now on
some<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.540> our<00:03:42.750> fly<00:03:43.019> wheels<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> friction
