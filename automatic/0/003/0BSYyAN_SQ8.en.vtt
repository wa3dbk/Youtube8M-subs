00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello everybody talking about windows here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 server 2012 for the site ms ric.com.br 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 the geo tv channel on youtube in this video 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 here I'll show you how to join a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.840
 computer in the offline domain 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 through a file generated by the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 john's command I'm going to use mine here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.260
 the domain controller that has the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.010
 windows 7 in 2012 I'm going to generate the file 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.380
 through it and I will insert a station 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 working with windows 8 which is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.610
 this station here and at the moment it is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 in a working group notice here is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 in a working group is not in the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.059
 canine domain 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 so I'll go back there on my controller 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.469
 domain 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.590
 I'll use the shortcut to the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.140
 windows and the letter x it opened menu I 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.830
 I'm going to open that command prompt with 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.810
 rock show admin privilege 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.510
 change that resolution to get better 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.439
 to visualize this here is a bit 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.600
 better there for you to see and here 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:27.810
 I'll type the command of john bar 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.979
 provision man bar 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 then I'll put my domain smell 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.600
 bar machine in a space puts the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 name of the machine that I'm going to put in the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.799
 domain that is clean 07 in space 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.110
 again save file 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.060
 and here is the name of the file I go 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.490
 I'm saving this file I'll copy 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.399
 it to another machine and will rotate 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.530
 new dj command for him to join 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.810
 that domain machine in the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.210
 based on this file that the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.520
 people are raising here so I go 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:12.800
 put this file to rename it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:16.940
 here chile 07 brings offline txt point 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.890
 who commands this here to zoom in here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.890
 For you to see better, too. 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.690
 putting in the description of the video is 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.110
 This command is complete here. 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.780
 I'll give you an enter from that moment. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.990
 it is already creating the file 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.920
 configuration is being saved 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.400
 here in this file ok he created 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.780
 successfully the txt file and through 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.120
 I'll join this file here. 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.720
 machine domain in offline mode 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.140
 Ok, let's go there at the station 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.710
 I work with windows 8 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.410
 I'll copy the file is inside my 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.690

 load I can go there in mine 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.510
 domain controller and verify that the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.130
 computer tip has already been created here 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.170
 Let's see, the account of the then 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.910
 the machine has already joined on Sunday with 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.620
 Let's go back there at the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.120
 I work with windows 8 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.890
 this has already loaded which have pressed here ô 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.080

 network disabled but you have already seen 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.130
 that the machine started with success in 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.650
 that the machine here she 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.320
 already in the domain or can I place 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.030
 activates my network card and then 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.030
 enter the domain here 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.580
 enables the network card to be 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:30.490
 disabled is taking ip 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.490
 ok identified domain that had tv.com 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.890
 I'm going to leave the place with the user of 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.890
 domain 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.120
 everybody there in the channel tv domain 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.130
 Okay, when are you going to use this type? 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.300
 method is usually the staff uses is 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.010
 company and large where you have 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.820
 domain controller that does not give in 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.250
 same 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.810
 in the same unit that you are where you 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.760
 has a high response time, 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.120
 communication with your domain controller 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.670
 and becomes a slow and communication and to 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.280
 Sometimes he loses he takes a time out that's 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.930
 on the workstation connection to the 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.480
 control of the domain then in this type of 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.240
 situation when the link is slow when 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.820
 to this slowness the staff uses this 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.160
 method of joining domain machine from 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.010
 offline mode in studying including 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.980
 test question from microsoft where you 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.950
 there is an alternative to use 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.370
 this method that is important and very 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.350
 used 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.740
