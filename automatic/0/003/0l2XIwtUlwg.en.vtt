00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460
 resistance we want to congratulate 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.619
 to the heroic Venezuelan people 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 that yesterday night despite the chains to think 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.649
 of the claim of the national government to silence him 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.929
 informally with a radio and television station 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.600
 like a forceful cacerolazo 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.590
 we reject aena closing radio caracas television but also 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.220
 approve will snatch 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.109
 but he clarified that that means 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.339
 of the democratic spirit of the peaceful behavior of the people 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.380
 Venezuelan 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.480
 who rejects energetically 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.310
 the closure of a means of communication that like the case of Caracas radio 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 TV 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.410
 it is part forms part of the historical memory 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.979
 of the Venezuelan people 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.469
 We also take the opportunity 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.270
 to call calm 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.950
 to the Venezuelan people 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.939
 to call for composure 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.430
 to the Venezuelan people 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.969
 and not be tempted to bite the comb of violence 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.530
 that is flirting at this time as strategic development 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 from the high national government and that we denounce before Venezuela and the world 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.710
 that chávez again coquettish 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.890
 with violence and Venezuelans of course we can not afford 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.740
 that this strategy can be consummated 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.890
 that is why it draws our attention powerfully that a government that during 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.049
 8 years during eight years of government has been launching a premise a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.280
 message to venezuela and the world 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.900
 that in Venezuela the town commands that no decision is made here 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.229
 without consulting the sovereign 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.880
 that this is where more queries have been made to the people to know through 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 of elections and referendum 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.680
 What do you want 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.869
 this government called nationalist patriot 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.420
 regarding the people and the sovereign intends to pass over 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.720
 85% of the Venezuelan population that emphatically and clearly 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.200
 open is telling you 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.680
 no at closing 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.090
 from r ctb 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.029
 It is therefore 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:30.719
 that we denounce before Venezuela and of course before the world that this behavior 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.430
 disgraceful of hugo chávez frías 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.020
 that today has removed the tank 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.790
 attacked the military to the streets 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.840
 to intimidate 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.329
 to the Venezuelan people 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.479
 of course he will not shut up 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.469
 if it falls peacefully but very forcefully of the Venezuelan people 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.430
 that will not allow more outrages 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.659
 against freedom of expression and of course against what is the 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.489
 Free transit of ideas and thought 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.219
 within the framework of plurality in our country 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.100
 It is therefore 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.389
 the national command of the resistance 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.199
