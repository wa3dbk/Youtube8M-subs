00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.660
 hi bowlby salutes the others 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 so I 'm going to show you face of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 show for you remember and for whom 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 you train on the campfire rhythm 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 so it's a very simple movement 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 it's a movement capturing fairy beats 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.489
 beat my skin so I'm doing this to them 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.550
 do ba ba to the beautiful boats so in 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:39.600
 repeating so that made my skin poppy 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.270

 aubin my skin oba oba my skin obama so 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.459
 that's a crazy pace of what's so simple 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.009
 can you do me on any flat 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.539
 on his so we'll add so here I did 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.849
 with muffled notes on them on 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.950
 horns but no I added agreements 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.280
 so we're going to make two simple chords 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.610
 to start so the minor so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.239
 I show you his two indexes on the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.030
 second rope going down 

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:56.369
 on the first freight and both but of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.039
 so must audois kill but here and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.280
 here I put you a symbol so the c1 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.320
 the minor 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.530
 so for starters I agree 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.570
 with this the rhythmic so the minor 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 and E minor where did you go to 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.310
 back both of a rope 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.110
 so in fact there the minor I'm going to you 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.000
 put a symbol for you to understand 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.700
 it is human 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.310
 the middle finger is placed on the second 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.490
 rope from the 2nd freight in 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.160
 from the top so important videos 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.450
 and the directory 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.220
 he gets on the third rope have not 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.610
 answered the 102nd fred simply 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.240
 and you add lots of excuses 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.120
 and rolling so it's below 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.510
 so I greet you so sweat in 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.650
 putting on a block your agreement with your 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.860
 left hand and on the rhythmic that 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.860
 would 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.870
 2 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.710
 and so you have to train 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.980
 on this this technique continue after 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.290
 a fairly simple rhythm the rhythm to 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.160
 campfire so the agreements so like 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.360
 you say there minors 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.720
 I like being the strong symbols you pick 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.470
 and well at the same time as the video 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.540
 minors 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.770
 you chained that after you can sign it 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.570
 other chords when you feel 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.160
 of course the change so you change 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:07.740
 on the when they change anything to when 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.560
 it does not change you 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.810
 baho 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.250
 in combat 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.430
 not 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.430
 or not 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.500
 barbel 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.500
 not you change 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.460
 me 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.660
 I exchange and so on with the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.250
 gymnastics of the fingers you will go more 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.250
 faster and it'll do something 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.320
 so here are the main chords are 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.860
 the minor meline hours you can 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.150
 add the E major 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.670
 I will see the different symbols in 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.760
 same time as the water video 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.300
 theirs is expensive 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.620
 and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.620
 in fact there you can go 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.840
 again 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.840
 of a weapon 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.760
 Ah finally 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.170
 here you are now on the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.440
 rhythmic so my skin houba houba houba 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:40.340
 houba houba houba pope with water pumps 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:44.230
 not papou houba houba bape in hockey 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.230
 so I redo I go back to you 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.759
 we change 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.759
 not 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.920
 bah 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.070
 we do not change 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.430
 we do not change 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.040
 that's the campfire rhythm on four 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.610
 time to go by train of you very good 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.610
 ciao graces
