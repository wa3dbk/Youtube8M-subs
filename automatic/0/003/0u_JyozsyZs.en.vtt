it<00:04:23.270> into<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.540> real<00:04:23.870> video<00:04:24.290> image<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.280> then

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
it into a real video image and then

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.250 
it into a real video image and then
allows<00:04:25.730> people<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.180> be<00:04:26.360> able<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.600> then<00:04:26.840> output

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
allows people to be able to then output

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.100 
allows people to be able to then output
standard<00:04:27.770> definition<00:04:28.400> for<00:04:28.880> HD<00:04:29.240> video<00:04:29.540> on<00:04:29.780> that

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
standard definition for HD video on that

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.380 
standard definition for HD video on that
whiteboard<00:04:30.380> system<00:04:31.100> with<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.270> was

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
whiteboard system with that so it was

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.470 
whiteboard system with that so it was
really<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.840> collaboration<00:04:33.560> between<00:04:34.480> luigia

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
really the collaboration between luigia

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.050 
really the collaboration between luigia
and<00:04:35.810> BA<00:04:36.380> do<00:04:36.590> coming<00:04:37.160> together<00:04:37.280> with<00:04:37.669> that<00:04:37.880> and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
and BA do coming together with that and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.180 
and BA do coming together with that and
saying<00:04:38.240> how<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.720> we<00:04:38.900> make<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.140> technology<00:04:39.890> even

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
saying how can we make a technology even

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.830 
saying how can we make a technology even
easier<00:04:40.580> well<00:04:40.790> this<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.060> how<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.240> do<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.540> well

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
easier well this is how you do it well

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.450 
easier well this is how you do it well
we've<00:04:41.990> been<00:04:42.080> showing<00:04:42.290> e-beam<00:04:42.680> today<00:04:43.190> at<00:04:43.370> the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
we've been showing e-beam today at the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.250 
we've been showing e-beam today at the
show<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:43.940> getting<00:04:44.060> feedback<00:04:44.330> from<00:04:44.540> resellers

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
show and getting feedback from resellers

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.650 
show and getting feedback from resellers
and<00:04:45.290> dealers<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:46.490> find<00:04:46.729> out<00:04:46.850> exactly<00:04:47.300> how<00:04:47.479> they

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
and dealers to find out exactly how they

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.870 
and dealers to find out exactly how they
would<00:04:47.780> use<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.169> technology<00:04:48.800> if<00:04:49.010> we<00:04:49.250> sold<00:04:49.760> it

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
would use the technology if we sold it

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.320 
would use the technology if we sold it
with<00:04:50.000> our<00:04:50.150> projectors<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:52.030> feedback<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.180> very

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
with our projectors the feedback is very

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.530 
with our projectors the feedback is very

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
positive they look at the technology

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.640 
positive they look at the technology
they<00:04:56.540> like<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.870> way<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> integrates<00:04:57.260> well

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
they like the way it integrates well

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.280
