all<00:00:01.530> right<00:00:01.800> well<00:00:02.700> then<00:00:02.850> assault<00:00:03.240> we're<00:00:03.629> going

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
all right well then assault we're going

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.650 
all right well then assault we're going
to<00:00:03.780> review<00:00:04.170> solving<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.859> bottom<00:00:05.130> layer<00:00:05.660> get

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
to review solving the bottom layer get

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.540 
to review solving the bottom layer get
the<00:00:06.810> cross<00:00:07.049> on<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.350> bottom<00:00:07.649> or<00:00:07.859> first<00:00:08.370> you

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the cross on the bottom or first you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.400 
the cross on the bottom or first you
want<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> solve<00:00:09.000> these<00:00:09.150> two<00:00:09.210> types<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.929> two

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
want to solve these two types of two

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
want to solve these two types of two
layers<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.250> then<00:00:11.519> get<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> cross<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> bus

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
layers and then get the cross on the bus

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.570 
layers and then get the cross on the bus
all<00:00:13.170> right<00:00:13.349> if<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.710> haven't<00:00:13.950> done<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.190> that

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
all right if you haven't done that that

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.460 
all right if you haven't done that that
doesn't<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.690> yet<00:00:16.049> pause<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.130> video

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
doesn't that yet pause this video

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.260 
doesn't that yet pause this video
practice<00:00:19.470> getting<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> top<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
practice getting the top two we get the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.540 
practice getting the top two we get the
cross<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> bottom<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.400> can

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
cross on the bottom and then you can

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.070 
cross on the bottom and then you can
play<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.760> rest<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> okay<00:00:26.420> what<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
play the rest of it okay what is the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.190 
play the rest of it okay what is the
next<00:00:28.320> step<00:00:28.439> after<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> cross

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.130 

do<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.410> remember<00:00:33.740> the<00:00:34.070> next

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
do you remember the next

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.040 
do you remember the next
night<00:00:35.710> step<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.220> to<00:00:36.430> match<00:00:36.700> two<00:00:37.660> adjacent

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
night step is to match two adjacent

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.549 
night step is to match two adjacent
sides<00:00:38.790> where<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.480> middle<00:00:40.809> pieces<00:00:41.079> will<00:00:41.379> be

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
sides where the middle pieces will be

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.310 
sides where the middle pieces will be
matched<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.970> doesn't<00:00:43.420> matter<00:00:43.600> this<00:00:43.930> doesn't

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
matched this doesn't matter this doesn't

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.069 
matched this doesn't matter this doesn't
match<00:00:44.470> so<00:00:44.980> that's<00:00:45.220> not<00:00:45.430> what<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:45.820> want<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
match so that's not what we want this

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.960 
match so that's not what we want this
matches<00:00:47.710> but<00:00:48.040> then<00:00:48.220> this<00:00:48.399> doesn't<00:00:48.820> match

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
matches but then this doesn't match

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.240 
matches but then this doesn't match
there's<00:00:49.750> no<00:00:49.870> matching<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.379> we<00:00:50.800> want<00:00:50.980> two

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
there's no matching that we want two

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.220 
there's no matching that we want two
adjacent<00:00:51.640> sides<00:00:52.059> matching<00:00:52.780> them<00:00:52.989> little

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
adjacent sides matching them little

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:06.149 
adjacent sides matching them little
pieces<00:00:53.500> how<00:00:54.370> much<00:00:54.519> of<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.850> queue<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.960> get<00:00:56.470> some

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.590 

pair<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.179> matches<00:01:07.689> ah<00:01:08.020> there's<00:01:08.920> one<00:01:09.060> blue<00:01:10.060> and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
pair of matches ah there's one blue and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.529 
pair of matches ah there's one blue and
red<00:01:11.259> if<00:01:11.649> you<00:01:11.770> can't<00:01:12.159> find<00:01:12.460> one<00:01:12.759> then<00:01:13.359> you're

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
red if you can't find one then you're

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.450 
red if you can't find one then you're
going<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.749> do<00:01:13.960> with<00:01:14.170> this<00:01:14.350> same<00:01:14.920> powder<00:01:15.189> that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.760 

the<00:03:08.160> bottom<00:03:08.460> once<00:03:08.720> should<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.170> matched

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
the bottom once should have all matched

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.300 
the bottom once should have all matched
edge<00:03:11.250> pieces<00:03:12.350> all<00:03:13.350> right<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.920> forgetting

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
edge pieces all right all forgetting

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.730 
edge pieces all right all forgetting
this<00:03:14.550> because<00:03:15.390> we're<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> last<00:03:16.530> and
