so<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.030> playing<00:01:51.299> games

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so we have been playing games

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
so we have been playing games
continuously<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:53.009> 10<00:01:53.310> minutes<00:01:53.850> now

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
continuously for about 10 minutes now

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
continuously for about 10 minutes now
and<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.320> temperatures<00:01:55.829> haven't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
and you can see temperatures haven't

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
and you can see temperatures haven't
risen<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.610> much<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.420> 41<00:01:57.869> degrees<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
risen that much it's 41 degrees in the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830 
risen that much it's 41 degrees in the
front<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.979> back<00:01:59.040> so<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.600> not

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
front and back so this one is not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
front and back so this one is not
heating<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> push<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
heating up we are going to push it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.959 
heating up we are going to push it
further<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.750> Need<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:03.990> Speed<00:02:04.200> Most<00:02:04.439> Wanted

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
further with Need for Speed Most Wanted

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.660 
further with Need for Speed Most Wanted
and<00:02:06.499> again<00:02:07.499> the<00:02:07.649> touch<00:02:07.859> response<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.399> pretty

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and again the touch response is pretty

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029

here the temperatures again haven't
risen<00:04:26.590> much<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.550> we<00:04:27.730> have<00:04:27.820> been<00:04:28.000> playing<00:04:28.270> games
