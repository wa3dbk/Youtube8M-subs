control<00:00:25.470> board<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.830> bad<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.070> had<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> red<00:00:26.580> line

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
control board was bad I had a red line

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
control board was bad I had a red line
on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> screen<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.510> places<00:00:28.019> oscillator<00:00:28.500> took

a the red line issue and also these
electrolytic<00:00:32.009> caps<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.669> haven't<00:00:32.850> put

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
electrolytic caps here I haven't put

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.790 
electrolytic caps here I haven't put
these<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> place<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.469> standard

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
these in place these are standard

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
these in place these are standard
through-hole<00:00:35.160> capacitors<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.940> put<00:00:36.180> here

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
through-hole capacitors that I put here

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.520 
through-hole capacitors that I put here
in<00:00:36.480> place<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.870> these<00:00:36.960> surface<00:00:37.350> mount

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
in place at these surface mount

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.950 
in place at these surface mount
electrolytic<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.879> seven<00:00:39.329> through-hole

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
electrolytic so seven through-hole

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.830 
electrolytic so seven through-hole
capacitors<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.309> had<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> replace<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
capacitors that I had a replace and in

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
capacitors that I had a replace and in
place<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.690> two<00:00:45.690> whole<00:00:45.930> other<00:00:46.140> surface

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
place of the two whole other surface

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
place of the two whole other surface
mount<00:00:47.190> electrolytic<00:00:47.789> caps<00:00:47.969> because<00:00:48.390> they

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
mount electrolytic caps because they

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
mount electrolytic caps because they
were<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.780> high<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> SR<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:49.980> okay

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
were very high in the SR so that's okay

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
were very high in the SR so that's okay
the<00:00:50.370> controller<00:00:50.700> part<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.960> voltage

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the controller part and the voltage

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
the controller part and the voltage
comparators<00:00:52.949> seem<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.670> okay<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> didn't

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
comparators seem to be okay so I didn't

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.740 
comparators seem to be okay so I didn't
have<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> replace<00:00:55.020> those<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> y-sustain<00:00:59.750> here

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
have to replace those the y-sustain here

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.219 
have to replace those the y-sustain here

switching<00:01:07.950> regulator<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.420> built<00:01:09.840> me

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
switching regulator on it so I built me

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.690 
switching regulator on it so I built me
build<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.830> own<00:01:10.950> high<00:01:11.820> pitch<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.689> why<00:01:12.840> sustains

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
build my own high pitch for why sustains

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.929 
build my own high pitch for why sustains
because<00:01:14.700> plasmas<00:01:15.509> between<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> years<00:01:16.560> of

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
because plasmas between the years of

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.200 
because plasmas between the years of
2004<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.060> 2008<00:01:18.659> always<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.470> these

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
2004 and 2008 always had these these

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
2004 and 2008 always had these these
hybrid<00:01:21.210> circuits<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.350> control

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
hybrid circuits are them for control

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
hybrid circuits are them for control

so<00:01:26.220> rather<00:01:26.970> than<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.390> through<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.689> these

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so rather than go through all these

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.590 
so rather than go through all these
components<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.220> one

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
components just to get to that one

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
components just to get to that one
switching<00:01:30.600> regulator<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.439> replace<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
switching regulator I just replace the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.289 
switching regulator I just replace the
entire<00:01:32.310> car<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:34.549> he's<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:36.000> excellent

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
entire car I know he's an excellent

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.590 
entire car I know he's an excellent
working<00:01:36.600> conditions<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.950> had<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.390> tune<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
working conditions and I had to tune it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
working conditions and I had to tune it
also<00:01:39.780> using<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> oscilloscope<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.860> again

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
also using the oscilloscope and again

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.550 
also using the oscilloscope and again
when<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> power<00:01:44.549> supply<00:01:44.720> this<00:01:45.720> long<00:01:46.320> arm

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
when the power supply this long arm

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.370 
when the power supply this long arm
resistor<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.460> open<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> 10<00:01:48.990> arms

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
resistor here was open this is a 10 arms

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.520 
resistor here was open this is a 10 arms
and<00:01:49.640> 5<00:01:50.640> Watts<00:01:50.970> had<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> replace<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.600> these<00:01:52.350> 2

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and 5 Watts had to replace that these 2

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.230 
and 5 Watts had to replace that these 2
electrolytic<00:01:53.159> s--<00:01:53.189> originally<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.090> were<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
electrolytic s-- originally they were a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.810 
electrolytic s-- originally they were a
thousand<00:01:54.750> microfarads<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.950> 200<00:01:56.430> volts<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:56.759> i

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
thousand microfarads at 200 volts so i

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.959 
thousand microfarads at 200 volts so i
put<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> 1200<00:01:58.020> 220<00:01:58.950> volts<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.790> this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
put in to 1200 220 volts in this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.700 
put in to 1200 220 volts in this
capacity<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:00.869> gonna<00:02:00.990> change<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.409> put

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
capacity here I'm gonna change just put

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.180 
capacity here I'm gonna change just put
it<00:02:01.799> better<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.250> better<00:02:03.119> cab<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.659> fits

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
it better a better cab that fits

cactus is a 1000 microfarad 100 volts
put<00:02:08.850> another<00:02:09.090> one<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.360> 33<00:02:10.020> hundred

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
put another one here 33 hundred

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.670 
put another one here 33 hundred
microfarads<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.460> 25<00:02:11.940> volts<00:02:12.330> alright<00:02:13.230> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
microfarads and 25 volts alright and

microfarads and 25 volts alright and
then<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.490> polypropylene<00:02:15.030> had<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> change

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
then at this polypropylene had to change

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.030 
then at this polypropylene had to change
that<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:17.010> bloom<00:02:17.370> polypropylene<00:02:17.970> at<00:02:18.330> 104

J even though this is a 104 K and this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.920 
J even though this is a 104 K and this
one<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:22.920> which<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.190> 104<00:02:23.760> J<00:02:24.090> also<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.660> took<00:02:24.720> this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
one here which is 104 J also I took this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
one here which is 104 J also I took this
out<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.110> another<00:02:25.350> board<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.550> here

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
out of another board and this one here

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.870 
out of another board and this one here
and<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.740> six<00:02:29.660> 685<00:02:30.660> J<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:32.100> that

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and this one is at six 685 J and that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.290 
and this one is at six 685 J and that
took<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.240> two<00:02:33.390> issues<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.060> let's<00:02:36.060> see

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
took here two issues there so let's see

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.170 
took here two issues there so let's see
and<00:02:37.820> we<00:02:38.820> have<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.970> nice<00:02:39.240> picture<00:02:40.940> let's<00:02:41.940> put<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and we have a nice picture let's put the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.730 
and we have a nice picture let's put the
camera<00:02:42.510> down<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.750> minutes<00:02:43.080> look<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
camera down for minutes look at the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.460 
camera down for minutes look at the
let's<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.830> get<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> menu<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.440> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
let's just get the menu going so that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.230 
let's just get the menu going so that
shows<00:02:49.890> me<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.250> downstream<00:02:50.640> video<00:02:51.060> is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
shows me that the downstream video is

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.810 
shows me that the downstream video is
working<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:52.530> TV<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.070> very<00:02:53.280> heavy<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.730> I'm

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
working this TV is very heavy and I'm

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.640 
working this TV is very heavy and I'm
holding<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.630> hand<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.380> got<00:02:55.560> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
holding it up with one hand so we got to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.370 
holding it up with one hand so we got to
put<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:55.920> down<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.390> that's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.960> done<00:02:58.170> deal

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
put this down so that's a done deal

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.190 
put this down so that's a done deal
there<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.390> yeah<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.810> wanted<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.080> show

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
there and so yeah just wanted to show

a little dusting and everything else
checks<00:03:54.640> okay<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.660> signal<00:03:56.319> here<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.830> have<00:03:57.459> a

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
checks okay and the signal here I have a

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.479 
checks okay and the signal here I have a
nice<00:03:57.730> 60<00:03:58.180> volts<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.630> my<00:03:58.720> bf<00:03:59.080> signal<00:03:59.470> and<00:04:00.130> let's

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
nice 60 volts in my bf signal and let's

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.240 
nice 60 volts in my bf signal and let's
let's<00:04:00.849> test<00:04:01.180> now<00:04:01.450> for<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.140> vs<00:04:02.800> signal<00:04:03.220> I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
let's test now for the vs signal I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.350 
let's test now for the vs signal I
should<00:04:03.459> have<00:04:03.610> about<00:04:03.849> 200<00:04:04.600> volts<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:07.090> we<00:04:07.120> got

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
should have about 200 volts so we got

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.290 
should have about 200 volts so we got
205<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.260> let's<00:04:08.410> bring<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.650> down<00:04:09.120> let's<00:04:10.120> bring

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
205 so let's bring that down let's bring

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.680 
205 so let's bring that down let's bring
that<00:04:10.360> voltage<00:04:10.690> down<00:04:11.050> a<00:04:11.080> little<00:04:11.350> bit<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:13.150> we<00:04:13.540> do

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
that voltage down a little bit and we do

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.159 
that voltage down a little bit and we do
that<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.590> tuning<00:04:15.130> pot<00:04:15.340> here<00:04:16.139> see<00:04:17.139> that

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
that with this tuning pot here see that

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.800 
that with this tuning pot here see that
to<00:04:17.650> me<00:04:17.680> pot<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.609> I'm<00:04:18.730> gonna<00:04:18.910> turn<00:04:19.180> that<00:04:19.239> until

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
to me pot so I'm gonna turn that until

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.580 
to me pot so I'm gonna turn that until
that<00:04:19.840> comes<00:04:20.139> down<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:21.000> 200<00:04:22.290> let's<00:04:23.290> go<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
that comes down to 200 let's go to the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.500 
that comes down to 200 let's go to the
opposite<00:04:24.100> way<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.900> going<00:04:26.229> on

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.970 

because<00:04:32.990> that's<00:04:33.200> what<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.530> panel<00:04:33.980> calls<00:04:34.820> for

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.610 

you<00:04:38.070> get<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.400> study

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
you get this study

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.330 
you get this study
we<00:04:41.040> got<00:04:41.250> good<00:04:41.970> 200<00:04:42.150> volts<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.590> vs<00:04:43.950> signal

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
we got good 200 volts the vs signal

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.030 
we got good 200 volts the vs signal
which<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.610> great<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.720> VA<00:04:45.900> signal<00:04:46.470> again

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
which is great and the VA signal again

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.220 
which is great and the VA signal again
that<00:04:47.280> should<00:04:47.460> be<00:04:47.870> behaving<00:04:48.870> should<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.200> a

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
that should be behaving should have a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.920 
that should be behaving should have a
nice<00:04:49.470> 60<00:04:50.010> volts<00:04:51.830> okay<00:04:52.830> great

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
nice 60 volts okay great

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.090 
nice 60 volts okay great
so<00:04:54.930> we're<00:04:55.080> good<00:04:55.230> there<00:04:55.440> sometimes<00:04:55.890> with

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
so we're good there sometimes with

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.760 
so we're good there sometimes with
plasma<00:04:56.550> TVs<00:04:56.970> if<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.240> get<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.660> lot<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.200> sparkle

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
plasma TVs if you get a lot of sparkle

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.700 
plasma TVs if you get a lot of sparkle
on<00:04:58.920> the<00:04:58.980> screen<00:04:59.370> just<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.330> can<00:05:00.510> adjust<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.230> vs

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
on the screen just you can adjust the vs

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.310 
on the screen just you can adjust the vs
and<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.010> VA<00:05:02.220> signals<00:05:02.910> or<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.060> ve<00:05:03.240> signals<00:05:03.780> to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
and the VA signals or the ve signals to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.900 
and the VA signals or the ve signals to
try<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.530> clean<00:05:04.770> some<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.040> that<00:05:05.220> mess<00:05:05.370> up<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.880> the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
try to clean some of that mess up on the

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.750 
try to clean some of that mess up on the
screen<00:05:06.360> also<00:05:07.050> but<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:07.920> lot<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.190> times<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.640> can

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
screen also but a lot of times that can

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.180 
screen also but a lot of times that can
come<00:05:08.970> from<00:05:09.150> actually<00:05:09.450> having<00:05:09.870> bad<00:05:10.680> tuning

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
come from actually having bad tuning

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.760 
come from actually having bad tuning
pots<00:05:11.400> these<00:05:12.240> tuning<00:05:12.600> pots<00:05:12.780> can<00:05:12.990> go<00:05:13.080> bad<00:05:13.290> also

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
pots these tuning pots can go bad also

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.950 
pots these tuning pots can go bad also
and<00:05:14.070> especially<00:05:14.820> some<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.420> polypropylene

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
and especially some of the polypropylene

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.650 
and especially some of the polypropylene
caps<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.830> are<00:05:16.890> in<00:05:17.310> parallel<00:05:17.820> with<00:05:18.450> these

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
caps that are in parallel with these

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.950 
caps that are in parallel with these
tuning<00:05:19.380> caps<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:19.800> got<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.070> check<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.580> that

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
tuning caps so you got to check for that

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.090 
tuning caps so you got to check for that
it's<00:05:21.960> very<00:05:22.140> important<00:05:22.680> also<00:05:22.890> here<00:05:23.700> on<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:25.100> the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
it's very important also here on the the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.400 
it's very important also here on the the
audio<00:05:26.700> section<00:05:27.000> unchanged<00:05:27.690> these<00:05:27.840> caps<00:05:28.170> out

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
audio section unchanged these caps out

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.220 
audio section unchanged these caps out
because<00:05:28.710> these<00:05:28.920> are<00:05:29.250> high<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:29.850> ESR<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:32.150> this

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
because these are high and ESR and this

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.560 
because these are high and ESR and this
alarm<00:05:34.230> here<00:05:34.770> LED<00:05:35.250> should<00:05:35.430> be<00:05:35.550> green<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.270> got

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
alarm here LED should be green so I got

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.530 
alarm here LED should be green so I got
to<00:05:36.660> do<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:37.110> little<00:05:37.590> bit<00:05:37.770> more<00:05:38.540> troubleshooting

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
to do a little bit more troubleshooting

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.730 
to do a little bit more troubleshooting
to<00:05:39.720> find<00:05:40.050> out<00:05:40.140> what's<00:05:40.290> going<00:05:40.500> on<00:05:40.620> this

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
to find out what's going on this

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.910 
to find out what's going on this
probably<00:05:41.040> is<00:05:41.130> just<00:05:41.160> some<00:05:41.910> bad<00:05:42.150> caps<00:05:42.480> or

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
probably is just some bad caps or

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.020 
probably is just some bad caps or
because<00:05:43.920> these<00:05:44.040> are<00:05:44.250> these<00:05:44.430> surface<00:05:44.820> mount

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
because these are these surface mount

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.420 
because these are these surface mount
electrolytic<00:05:45.630> apps<00:05:45.840> are<00:05:46.140> like<00:05:46.560> joke<00:05:46.860> it's

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
electrolytic apps are like joke it's

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.880
