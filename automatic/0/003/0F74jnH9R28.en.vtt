00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.160
 two 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.160
 a little more 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.880
 some of you have told us that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.110
 the rabbits have attacked you but good 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.759
 The first thing that I have to tell you is that 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.690
 the rabbits are very calm the 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.350
 rabbits do not really attack like this 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.350
 God 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.340
 god god god can not be god 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.340
 they take out the bug my god but what is this 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.040
 but what happened 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.710
 that the whale with this man plays 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.900
 often scare you hit me mother of mine 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.610
 my mother my mother comes strip for 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.020
 dish has for the dish we are going to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.220
 explain to these people that this is a 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.470
 assembly and that the rabbits do nothing 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.860
 well after this scare that has 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.320
 stuck mariona we insist again that 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.420
 rabbits are tame animals are 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.970
 very calm animals and if well 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.070
 some of you have told us that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.380
 at some point your rabbit has 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.960
 shown a bit aggressive or has 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.180
 bitten at some point moment this is 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.400
 fundamentally when rabbits 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.680
 they are in period of estrus and in addition 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.790
 fundamentally the males because 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.710
 defend their territory 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.300
 I will also tell you that there are some of them 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.520
 that attack the feet because when 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.120
 we walk we make a sound 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.220
 this and surely if you have already had 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.500
 rabbits you will know that many rabbits 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.010
 when they get angry and when they mark their 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 territory 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.110
 they knock against our soil 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.210
 walk they identify it as a challenge 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.520
 our towards them towards their territory 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.410
 and there are some of these animals that do 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.380
 that can show a little 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.420
 aggressive in this sense but it is very 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.200
 Easy to remedy is very easy to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.200
 remedy because really when then 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.640
 moss is sterilized as this calms down 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.310
 pretty much the sex hormones are 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.400
 reduce and the truth that rabbits are 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
 they come back quite calm 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.020
 mariona for ya man that we are not going to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.730
 never finish good man friends that 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.890
 we can not finish that the rabbits do not 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.690
 they bite that they are excellent pets 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.320
 and I hope you have had a great time 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.320
