00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
polish because it prevents them from

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:15.980 
polish because it prevents them from
breaking

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.319

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.030 
the sponge so that the colors don't
intermix<00:02:47.139> and<00:02:48.139> it<00:02:48.290> would<00:02:48.379> look<00:02:48.469> like<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.709> you

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
intermix and it would look like that you

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.740 
intermix and it would look like that you
just<00:02:49.069> want<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.370> keep<00:02:49.549> doing<00:02:49.969> different

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
just want to keep doing different

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.830 
just want to keep doing different
corners<00:02:51.109> of<00:02:51.290> me<00:02:51.379> now<00:02:52.480> now<00:02:53.480> I'm<00:02:53.569> going<00:02:53.689> to<00:02:53.780> do

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
corners of me now now I'm going to do

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.089 
corners of me now now I'm going to do
the<00:02:53.959> same<00:02:54.139> thing<00:02:54.439> with<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.620> blue<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.829> after

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
the same thing with the blue and after

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.980 
the same thing with the blue and after
it's<00:03:01.249> done<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.639> look<00:03:01.760> like<00:03:01.939> this

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.200 

and<00:03:06.530> my<00:03:06.680> last<00:03:06.860> color<00:03:07.160> for<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.730> other<00:03:07.880> corner

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
and my last color for the other corner

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.910 
and my last color for the other corner
is<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.540> yellow<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.380> I'm<00:03:09.470> doing<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.740> same

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
is the yellow so I'm doing the same

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.980 
is the yellow so I'm doing the same
exact<00:03:10.280> thing<00:03:10.460> using<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.270> different<00:03:11.600> corner<00:03:11.810> of

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
exact thing using a different corner of

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.770 
exact thing using a different corner of
the<00:03:12.200> sponge<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:15.080> should<00:03:15.260> look<00:03:15.350> like<00:03:15.410> this

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
the sponge and it should look like this

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.970 
the sponge and it should look like this
now<00:03:17.780> you're<00:03:17.990> going<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.170> take<00:03:18.350> your<00:03:18.380> last<00:03:18.710> color

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
which mine is purple and you're going to

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.050 
which mine is purple and you're going to
put<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.080> on<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:22.130> cardboard<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:22.820> like<00:03:22.910> you

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
put it on the cardboard just like you

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.060 
put it on the cardboard just like you
are<00:03:23.210> doing<00:03:23.360> before<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.350> use<00:03:24.470> different<00:03:24.920> side

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
are doing before and use different side

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.680 
are doing before and use different side
of<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.250> sponge<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:25.850> then<00:03:26.420> you're<00:03:26.540> going<00:03:26.630> to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
of the sponge and then you're going to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.660 
of the sponge and then you're going to
put<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.050> right<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> middle<00:03:27.740> of<00:03:27.980> all<00:03:28.400> those

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
put it right in the middle of all those

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.400 
put it right in the middle of all those
colors<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.140> looks<00:03:30.380> like<00:03:30.440> that

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.590
