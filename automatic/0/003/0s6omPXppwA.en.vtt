on<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> web<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.830> seamless<00:00:20.130> texture

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
on the web this is a seamless texture

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
on the web this is a seamless texture
first<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.890> gonna<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.070> rid<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> cube<00:00:29.480> set

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
first I'm gonna get rid of the cube set

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:51.150 
first I'm gonna get rid of the cube set
the<00:00:30.630> scene<00:00:30.990> here

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.680 

now<00:00:52.160> we're<00:00:52.520> gonna<00:00:52.610> set<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.000> for<00:00:53.240> cycles

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
now we're gonna set this for cycles

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.430 
now we're gonna set this for cycles
render<00:00:55.750> so<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:56.930> I'm<00:00:57.020> gonna<00:00:57.140> go<00:00:57.350> into<00:00:57.710> my<00:00:57.740> lamp

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
render so now I'm gonna go into my lamp

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.730 
render so now I'm gonna go into my lamp
and<00:01:00.440> use<00:01:00.680> notes<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:01.340> set<00:01:01.610> this<00:01:01.760> for<00:01:02.060> about<00:01:02.740> 700

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
and use notes I set this for about 700

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:16.650 
and use notes I set this for about 700
since<00:01:04.580> it's<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:04.970> close

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:26.590

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
/ - my render view and I should be good

to<00:01:26.720> go<00:01:26.900> with<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.170> material<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.210> what<00:01:29.330> I'm

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
to go with the material so what I'm

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:39.730 
to go with the material so what I'm
gonna<00:01:29.660> do<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:31.040> open<00:01:32.229> up<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.410> second<00:01:34.390> area<00:01:38.740> where

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
gonna do is open up a second area where

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.630 
gonna do is open up a second area where
I'm<00:01:39.830> gonna<00:01:39.979> unwrap<00:01:40.490> my<00:01:40.700> texture<00:01:41.479> UV<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.490> we'll

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
I'm gonna unwrap my texture UV so we'll

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.050 
I'm gonna unwrap my texture UV so we'll
change<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.150> UV<00:01:44.630> image<00:01:44.750> editor<00:01:45.850> go<00:01:46.850> into

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.529 
spear projection I don't know you can
you<00:01:57.500> could<00:01:57.590> unwrap<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:57.979> just<00:01:58.369> regular<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:59.030> like

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
you could unwrap it just regular I like

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.029 
you could unwrap it just regular I like

the sphere projection the way it comes

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.290 
the sphere projection the way it comes
out<00:02:02.860> sizes<00:02:03.860> down<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.100> little<00:02:04.340> bit<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:04.850> fits

this up down here

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:38.160 
this up down here
go<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> Minoans<00:02:25.890> editor

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.620 

then<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.900> monkey<00:02:41.200> selected<00:02:42.180> we're<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.540> to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
then the monkey selected we're going to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.570 
then the monkey selected we're going to
our<00:02:43.750> materials<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.700> new<00:02:45.700> material<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:48.280> down

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
our materials and new material then down

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.420 
our materials and new material then down
here<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.000> our<00:02:49.090> node<00:02:49.360> editor<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:50.860> diffuse

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
here in our node editor we have diffuse

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.710 
here in our node editor we have diffuse
be<00:02:51.640> SDF<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.630> material<00:02:53.319> output<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.450> what<00:02:55.600> we're

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
be SDF and material output so what we're

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.300 
be SDF and material output so what we're
gonna<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:56.020> is<00:02:56.140> material<00:02:56.590> up<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:56.920> gonna<00:02:57.040> be

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
gonna do is material up it's gonna be

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.160 
gonna do is material up it's gonna be
our<00:02:57.730> end<00:02:57.940> result<00:02:59.640> diffuse<00:03:00.640> BFBS<00:03:01.420> DF<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.989> gonna

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
our end result diffuse BFBS DF is gonna

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.750 
our end result diffuse BFBS DF is gonna
be<00:03:02.290> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.709> our<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.160> flat<00:03:03.819> shader<00:03:05.760> now

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
be kind of like our a flat shader now

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.410 
be kind of like our a flat shader now
we're<00:03:07.209> gonna<00:03:07.330> want<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.690> do<00:03:07.870> an<00:03:09.090> input<00:03:10.090> like<00:03:10.390> a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
we're gonna want to do an input like a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.750 
we're gonna want to do an input like a
texture<00:03:10.780> coordinate<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:14.489> input<00:03:15.489> texture

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
texture coordinate so input texture

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.220 
texture coordinate so input texture
coordinates<00:03:16.330> cuz<00:03:16.569> we're<00:03:16.690> gonna<00:03:16.780> pull<00:03:17.080> some

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
coordinates cuz we're gonna pull some

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.650 
coordinates cuz we're gonna pull some
our<00:03:17.380> UV<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.130> then<00:03:18.940> we're<00:03:19.060> gonna<00:03:19.150> want<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.480> map

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
our UV and then we're gonna want to map

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.330 
our UV and then we're gonna want to map
the<00:03:19.840> vector<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.450> well<00:03:22.450> add<00:03:23.100> sector<00:03:24.100> mapping

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the vector so well add sector mapping

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.500 
the vector so well add sector mapping
we're<00:03:27.340> gonna<00:03:27.489> go<00:03:27.700> UV<00:03:28.090> 2<00:03:28.239> vector

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.369 

and<00:03:34.140> on<00:03:34.440> these<00:03:34.650> settings<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:36.140> think<00:03:37.140> we<00:03:37.260> can

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
and on these settings I think we can

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:48.990 
and on these settings I think we can
probably<00:03:37.709> move<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.129> scaled<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:39.000> 2.5

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.390 

then<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.180> between<00:03:50.270> our<00:03:50.599> diffuse<00:03:51.099> we<00:03:52.099> want<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
then in between our diffuse we want to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.010 
then in between our diffuse we want to
put<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.580> texture<00:03:52.970> which<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.630> gonna<00:03:53.780> be<00:03:53.870> our

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
put a texture which is gonna be our

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.270 
put a texture which is gonna be our
whipped<00:03:54.380> texture<00:03:54.709> we're<00:03:54.890> going<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.069> add<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.720> so

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
whipped texture we're going to add in so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.910 
whipped texture we're going to add in so
I've<00:03:58.280> got<00:03:58.489> texture<00:03:59.000> image<00:03:59.480> texture<00:04:02.920> we're

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
I've got texture image texture we're

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.479 
I've got texture image texture we're
gonna<00:04:04.010> run<00:04:04.250> our<00:04:04.370> vector<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:06.370> vector<00:04:07.370> to

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
gonna run our vector to it vector to

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.020 

like<00:04:16.139> you're<00:04:16.259> just<00:04:16.289> get<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.739> connect<00:04:17.039> here

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.060 

there<00:04:21.030> we<00:04:21.150> go

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
there we go

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:33.830 
there we go
now<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.100> want<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.340> open<00:04:23.460> my<00:04:23.610> image<00:04:23.970> texture

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.730 

now<00:04:34.380> from<00:04:34.650> here<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.930> want<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.110> go<00:04:37.230> my<00:04:37.380> color<00:04:37.650> to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
now from here I want to go my color to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.830 
now from here I want to go my color to
color<00:04:40.639> and<00:04:41.639> we<00:04:41.730> have<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.880> basic<00:04:42.419> wood<00:04:42.630> we're

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
color and we have a basic wood we're

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.909 
color and we have a basic wood we're
gonna<00:04:42.960> clean<00:04:43.230> this<00:04:43.380> up<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.620> little<00:04:43.800> bit

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.899 

someone<00:04:49.520> had<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.669> Fresnel<00:04:51.580> fresnels<00:04:52.580> under<00:04:52.819> the

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
someone had a Fresnel fresnels under the

00:04:52.909 --> 00:05:01.240 
someone had a Fresnel fresnels under the
input

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.430 

and<00:05:01.730> then<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.120> combined<00:05:02.510> our<00:05:02.720> Fresnel<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.350> our

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
and then to combined our Fresnel and our

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.410 
and then to combined our Fresnel and our
diffuse<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:04.220> our<00:05:04.310> material<00:05:04.460> output<00:05:05.150> we<00:05:05.300> want

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
diffuse to our material output we want

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.800 
diffuse to our material output we want
to<00:05:05.570> put<00:05:05.690> in<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.870> mix<00:05:06.080> shader'<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:09.050> ad<00:05:09.260> shader<00:05:10.810> mix

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
to put in a mix shader' so ad shader mix

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.500 
to put in a mix shader' so ad shader mix
shader'<00:05:12.820> we're<00:05:13.820> gonna<00:05:13.910> put<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:14.330> the

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
shader' we're gonna put this in the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.020 
shader' we're gonna put this in the
middle<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:15.710> we<00:05:15.740> got<00:05:15.950> our<00:05:16.040> B<00:05:16.220> SDF<00:05:16.640> going<00:05:16.940> a

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
middle so we got our B SDF going a

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.470 
middle so we got our B SDF going a
shader<00:05:17.300> you<00:05:19.000> want<00:05:20.000> our<00:05:20.090> FAC<00:05:20.390> on<00:05:20.810> FAC<00:05:22.300> and<00:05:23.300> we

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
shader you want our FAC on FAC and we

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.470 
shader you want our FAC on FAC and we
ever<00:05:23.630> shader<00:05:23.990> going<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.740> surface<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:26.360> this

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
ever shader going to surface and this

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.900 
ever shader going to surface and this
looks<00:05:26.750> pretty<00:05:27.290> good<00:05:27.440> here<00:05:27.980> with<00:05:28.370> our<00:05:28.580> rendered

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
looks pretty good here with our rendered

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.540 
looks pretty good here with our rendered
view<00:05:29.680> but<00:05:30.680> what<00:05:30.890> if<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.100> want<00:05:31.280> to<00:05:31.340> make<00:05:31.430> it

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
view but what if I want to make it

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.100 
view but what if I want to make it
glossy<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:33.580> we<00:05:34.580> can<00:05:34.760> do<00:05:34.850> to<00:05:34.940> do<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.120> let's<00:05:35.990> go

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
glossy so we can do to do that let's go

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.240 
glossy so we can do to do that let's go
to<00:05:36.140> shader<00:05:37.180> glossy<00:05:38.800> I'm<00:05:39.800> gonna<00:05:39.950> set<00:05:40.160> the

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
to shader glossy I'm gonna set the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.850 
to shader glossy I'm gonna set the
roughness<00:05:40.670> on<00:05:40.850> this<00:05:41.030> two<00:05:41.180> point<00:05:41.480> zero<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.990> five

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.010 

try<00:05:48.860> it<00:05:48.920> better<00:05:49.130> off<00:05:49.310> typing<00:05:49.730> it<00:05:49.820> in<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.900> then

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
try it better off typing it in and then

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.330 
try it better off typing it in and then
we're<00:05:54.110> gonna<00:05:54.200> put<00:05:54.470> this<00:05:54.620> into<00:05:54.890> our<00:05:55.070> other

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
we're gonna put this into our other

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.000 
we're gonna put this into our other
shader<00:05:55.700> for<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.120> mix<00:05:56.270> shader'<00:05:56.770> which<00:05:57.770> gives

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
shader for the mix shader' which gives

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.870 
shader for the mix shader' which gives
us<00:05:58.100> a<00:05:58.340> nice<00:05:58.520> glossy<00:05:59.000> view<00:05:59.830> so<00:06:00.830> to<00:06:01.220> see<00:06:01.430> good<00:06:01.700> end

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
us a nice glossy view so to see good end
