all<00:00:02.580> right<00:00:03.060> there<00:00:03.240> have<00:00:03.330> been<00:00:03.449> quite<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.810> bit<00:00:04.020> of

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
all right there have been quite a bit of

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.980 
all right there have been quite a bit of
changes<00:00:04.680> since<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.310> posted<00:00:05.940> my<00:00:06.180> last<00:00:06.600> video

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
changes since I posted my last video

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.740 
changes since I posted my last video
first<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.680> all<00:00:08.120> um<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:11.280> retention<00:00:11.880> bracket<00:00:12.599> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
first of all um the retention bracket on

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.650 
first of all um the retention bracket on
the<00:00:12.900> motherboard<00:00:13.170> broke<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:15.059> cpu

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
the motherboard broke and the cpu

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.580 
the motherboard broke and the cpu
heatsink<00:00:15.830> just<00:00:16.830> fell<00:00:17.250> off<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> had<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> drain

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
heatsink just fell off so I had to drain

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.130 
heatsink just fell off so I had to drain
the<00:00:19.800> oil<00:00:20.570> basically<00:00:21.570> take<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> whole<00:00:22.109> thing

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the oil basically take the whole thing

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.070 
the oil basically take the whole thing
apart<00:00:22.470> take<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> motherboard<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:23.939> get<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
apart take the motherboard out get the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.849 
apart take the motherboard out get the
old<00:00:25.730> retention<00:00:26.730> bracket<00:00:27.150> off<00:00:27.680> rather<00:00:28.680> than

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
old retention bracket off rather than

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.410 
old retention bracket off rather than
replace<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:30.029> another<00:00:31.099> plastic

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
replace it with another plastic

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.520 
replace it with another plastic
retention<00:00:33.420> bracket<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> would<00:00:34.110> probably

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
retention bracket that would probably

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.420 
retention bracket that would probably
break<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.309> ended<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.570> bolting<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.530> water

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
break I ended up just bolting a water

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.369 
break I ended up just bolting a water
block<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.610> just<00:00:41.719> replacing<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> CPU

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
block to it and just replacing the CPU

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
block to it and just replacing the CPU
with<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.820> which<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.850> actually<00:00:45.120> working<00:00:45.450> out

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
with that which is actually working out

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
with that which is actually working out
pretty<00:00:45.809> nice<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> keeps

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
pretty nice because that way it keeps

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.479 
pretty nice because that way it keeps
the<00:00:47.879> CPU<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.829> cooler<00:00:50.390> than<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> oil<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
the CPU a lot cooler than the oil and

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.689 
the CPU a lot cooler than the oil and
the<00:00:53.809> water<00:00:54.809> block<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.530> pulls<00:00:56.190> some<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the water block actually pulls some of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.920 
the water block actually pulls some of
the<00:00:56.879> heat<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.510> oil<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.530> it

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
the heat from the oil out with it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
the heat from the oil out with it
decided<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.770> water<00:01:02.579> cooling

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
decided to go with the water cooling

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.270 
decided to go with the water cooling
because<00:01:03.870> i<00:01:03.989> actually<00:01:04.170> bought<00:01:04.470> this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
because i actually bought this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.539 
because i actually bought this
before<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.299> happened<00:01:08.860> because<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:10.159> was<00:01:10.190> going

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
before it happened because I was going

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.670 
before it happened because I was going
to<00:01:10.670> cut<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.119> water<00:01:11.360> block<00:01:11.720> off<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.290> just<00:01:12.409> use

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
to cut the water block off and just use

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.490 
to cut the water block off and just use
this<00:01:12.920> device<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.369> pump<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.540> oil<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.110> cool<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
this device to pump the oil and cool the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.230 
this device to pump the oil and cool the
oil<00:01:16.840> but<00:01:18.040> since<00:01:19.040> my<00:01:20.500> cpu<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:22.549> think<00:01:22.909> just

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
oil but since my cpu you think just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.330 
oil but since my cpu you think just
broke<00:01:23.810> off<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.380> i<00:01:24.440> needed<00:01:24.619> something<00:01:25.009> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
broke off and i needed something to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.190 
broke off and i needed something to
replace<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:26.000> i<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:26.390> decided<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.930> go<00:01:27.080> with

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
replace it i just decided to go with

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.820 
replace it i just decided to go with
this<00:01:27.380> since<00:01:27.710> i<00:01:27.830> had<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.100> on<00:01:28.190> hand

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
this since i had it on hand

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
this since i had it on hand
that's<00:01:30.460> working<00:01:30.850> out<00:01:30.970> nicely<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.670> other

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
that's working out nicely the other

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.680 
that's working out nicely the other
change<00:01:34.240> will<00:01:34.420> notice<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.960> while<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:37.530> oil<00:01:38.530> was

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
change will notice is while the oil was

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.450 
change will notice is while the oil was
out<00:01:40.690> of<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.140> computer<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.980> oil<00:01:42.160> tank

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
out of the computer and in the oil tank

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.480 
out of the computer and in the oil tank
I<00:01:42.730> added<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.650> ultraviolet<00:01:44.650> green<00:01:45.040> oil

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
I added the ultraviolet green oil

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.750 
I added the ultraviolet green oil
soluble<00:01:46.030> died<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:47.140> now<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.130> turned<00:01:48.430> this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
soluble died and now it turned this

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.370 
soluble died and now it turned this
crazy<00:01:49.630> green<00:01:50.080> color<00:01:51.270> didn't<00:01:52.270> look<00:01:52.330> as<00:01:52.510> cool<00:01:52.930> as

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
crazy green color didn't look as cool as

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.350 
crazy green color didn't look as cool as
I<00:01:53.620> hoped<00:01:53.920> because<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.370> thought<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.910> UV

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
I hoped because I thought that the UV

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.800 
I hoped because I thought that the UV
would<00:01:55.600> sort<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:55.960> illuminate<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.980> whole<00:01:57.220> oil

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
would sort of illuminate the whole oil

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.100 
would sort of illuminate the whole oil
but<00:01:58.810> um<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.640> really<00:02:00.820> only<00:02:01.030> goes<00:02:01.360> out<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.630> few

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
but um it really only goes out a few

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.360 
but um it really only goes out a few
inches<00:02:02.290> because<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.370> ultraviolet

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
inches because all the ultraviolet

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.389 
inches because all the ultraviolet
radiation<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.450> converted<00:02:08.200> into<00:02:08.350> green<00:02:09.100> light

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
radiation is converted into green light

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.870 
radiation is converted into green light
before<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.530> completely<00:02:11.530> illuminates<00:02:12.459> all<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
before it completely illuminates all the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.730 
before it completely illuminates all the
oil<00:02:13.090> but<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.320> still<00:02:14.560> looks

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
oil but you can see that it still looks

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.550 
oil but you can see that it still looks
pretty<00:02:15.070> cool

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.300 

I<00:02:21.680> fixed<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> cables<00:02:23.239> quite<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.569> bit<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
I fixed up the cables quite a bit that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.760 
I fixed up the cables quite a bit that
was<00:02:25.489> out

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
was out

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.600 
was out
these<00:02:27.340> tubes<00:02:28.000> they<00:02:28.360> were<00:02:28.420> originally<00:02:29.080> had

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
these tubes they were originally had

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.610 
these tubes they were originally had
blue<00:02:30.610> water<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.780> blue<00:02:32.020> cool<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:32.440> I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
blue water and it is blue cool if I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.800 
blue water and it is blue cool if I
added<00:02:33.100> some<00:02:33.130> green<00:02:33.960> dye<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.500> also<00:02:36.810> turned

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
added some green dye to that also turned

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.790 
added some green dye to that also turned
it<00:02:37.990> sort<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.260> an<00:02:38.380> ultraviolet<00:02:38.950> green<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.940 

this<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.670> pretty<00:02:45.970> much<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:47.130> final<00:02:48.130> product

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
this is pretty much the final product

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.010 
this is pretty much the final product
you
