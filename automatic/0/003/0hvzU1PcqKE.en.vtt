00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 and then guys read here again and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
 Guys, you just want to give a tip here. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.259
 You are to increase some attributes a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.370
 gta's online character is there 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.990
 first that I'm going to teach how 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.590
 increase productivity 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.100
 basically one stands still and where it arrives 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 behind the stealth mode and then kills oo 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.320
 character can kill with a knife 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.390
 punch so much that can not with weapon is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 because a weapon I do not know why not 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.950
 It's when I did I did it with the knife. 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.410
 but if you do like with punches and kills 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 room and I do not know why. 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.550
 that does not arrive and is there ends up calling 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.379
 a lot of attention but I promise it's basically 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 It stands there or comes through. 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.270
 back sneaky and steals ee killed 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.530
 the character about 20 minutes 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.059
 you must complete the entire hem and it is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.390
 Very interesting, my character has the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859
 complete belly there comments force strength 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.510
 very interesting because every punch of the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.579
 affection when it is at maximum strength of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 much more damage because when he is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.140
 na na na sheath is very well here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.990
 starting then I was doing things 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.990
 who uses a delicate pen in the car and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 another hitting the car is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.869
 hit on the side of the car so much 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.549
 does 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.490
 including a guy who came to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.040
 to mess up we tried to go out and kill 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 But he ended up getting away. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.570
 It's but basically this is it you in a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.829
 event inside any car can be 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.610
 any car does not have to be a case 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.560
 special not 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.170
 and also any car was inside 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.829
 stop and another will go there breaking 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.990
 he is on the outside until he increases his strength 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.020
 whole process should take some 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 about 10 minutes and then when 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 one finished and can do the other too 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.689
 which makes it difficult to 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.259
 explode 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.299
 and it's very interesting, that's it, people are 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.920
 do not talk a little bit about gt online 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.170
 I've played up enough to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.409
 take down a little black ops such 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.670
 playing a lot of leagues too, I found 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.550
 very interesting 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.929
 though it's limited because that 's how I am 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.120
 I think he could have made a 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.790
 thing equal to gta 4 which is having your 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.909
 modes 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.129
 Gets the internet and gprs things that have 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.719
 That's right but also is so you had the 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.250
 op you had the options there on the cell phone 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.680
 which way did you want to play and did you think 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.750
 he was much better than that style 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.879
 properly than this then you have a 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.220
 place on the map you have to go there 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.980
 You choose one thing there that I like. 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.250
 interesting is taubatÃ© to blow up a car 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.569
 It 's not good to care 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.310
 blowing really cool because you're done 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.760
 in the process of buying bad servers 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.879
 losers is I ended up going out today 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.230
 day 24 is because to such I have a tank 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.459
 of war that will even appear on the front 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.689
 with a car with that I had 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.329
 hurry to him 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.829
 and from destroying you so much cars, I ended up 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.790
 falling on that server there hands 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.129
 losers is is they even correct 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.379
 They updated for you now. 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.120
 not pay that car there so much that it's the 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.549
 that I have a yellow 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.099
 eliasch is economy explains eliete 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.829
 paid 8 thousand I paid even the staff 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.169
 of the star and I had to pay was a 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.480
 bug scrotum worked already has online 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:19.540
 but now it 's correct and now who pays 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.639
 who destroys is now when he destroys the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.519
 Just a little bit behind and when 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.959
 I tested the car just for 83 84 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.120
 dollars now is little 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.489
 It's when you die, you had to 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.489
 pay two thousand and five hundred and now you 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.139
 only pay is $ 500 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.340
 I think it's better because it's there all 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.659
 world losing a lot of money when 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.250
 When anyone dies, nobody likes it. 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.169
 I then but then I guess so is 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.449
 well present can play today 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.010
 doing missions with friends than 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.919
 to stand around town invade 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.440
 year because it's cool then you stay 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.540
 walking with friends and such but does not have 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.790
 so much to do because playing 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.040
 He's playing golf and I do not see much. 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.889
 Grace , this is for me, I think. 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.379
 was very interesting because there are several 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.180
 types of emissions is good for you 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.979
 plan and such and also in the future will 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.209
 end up taking a few more should come out 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:14.560
 I think I'll drive omissions Aoun 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.599
 bring some way I hope it was 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.609
 some modes of the a4 chip because it is a 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.419
 athlete I loved playing straight but 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.310
 in this case it was not but at last the sun 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.720
 video is this is this is basic 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.520
 these tips and talk a little bit to us 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.690
 online I find it very interesting to play more 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 has played but is was the function of the video 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.070
 it was more on the table than the country 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.650
 how to increase productivity strength 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.340
 because the rest does not have so much secret to 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.169
 was fooled even for resistance I 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.139
 I went biking for example as well 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.780
 resistance and in the afternoon I also think that 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:53.680
 There is no secret, just get it and stay. 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.230
 flying but the adage of these two areas of 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.590
 activity and strength if you want 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.840
 which I showed increase in less than 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.139
 half an hour I think memories are 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.600
 also co2 which of course I passed 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.490
 I hope that you guys have 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.400
 liked the video if they liked left 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.350
 a favorite there and that's it, it's over there 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.090
 I'll be back with a video for you guys. 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.090
 Look the staff said
