00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I'm in the minority there as well so

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
I'm in the minority there as well so
it's<00:00:33.930> something<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.770> Infinity<00:00:35.280> Ward<00:00:35.489> games

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it's something with Infinity Ward games

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.250 
it's something with Infinity Ward games
i<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
i think you know it's got to be the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.280 
i think you know it's got to be the
pacing<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.100> games<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:38.940> black<00:00:39.300> ops<00:00:39.570> 1<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
pacing for me games like black ops 1 I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
pacing for me games like black ops 1 I
was<00:00:40.500> okay<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.250> black<00:00:41.430> ops<00:00:41.640> 2<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
was okay with but black ops 2 is just so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
was okay with but black ops 2 is just so
goddamn<00:00:42.750> fast<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.100> threw<00:00:44.340> me<00:00:44.370> off

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
goddamn fast that it just threw me off

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720 
goddamn fast that it just threw me off
way<00:00:45.510> too<00:00:45.539> much<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.410> never<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.920> get

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
way too much and I can never really get

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
way too much and I can never really get
into<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> good<00:00:48.390> groove<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.960> never<00:00:49.170> really

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
into a good groove and I never really

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189 
into a good groove and I never really
felt<00:00:49.800> comfortable<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.640> black<00:00:51.270> ops<00:00:51.480> 2<00:00:51.600> even<00:00:52.079> at

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
felt comfortable in black ops 2 even at

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.689 
felt comfortable in black ops 2 even at
the<00:00:52.289> end<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.530> its<00:00:52.680> life<00:00:52.770> cycle<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.520> quite

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the end of its life cycle and quite

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.729 
the end of its life cycle and quite
honestly<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.270> me<00:00:54.329> black<00:00:54.629> ops<00:00:54.840> 2<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.230> worse<00:00:55.469> as

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
honestly for me black ops 2 got worse as

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.970 
honestly for me black ops 2 got worse as
it<00:00:55.770> went<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.969> reality<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.530> just

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it went on and in reality it just

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.580 
it went on and in reality it just
stopped<00:00:59.359> it's<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.570> holding<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.079> attention

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
stopped it's not holding my attention

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380 
stopped it's not holding my attention
and<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.100> wasn't<00:01:02.280> fun<00:01:02.699> i<00:01:02.730> didn't<00:01:03.270> like

relevant<00:01:44.640> again<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> ghosts<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.840> that's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
relevant again and ghosts but that's

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.630 
relevant again and ghosts but that's
already<00:01:46.590> been<00:01:46.770> said<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> different

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
already been said in a different

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
already been said in a different
commentary<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.840> two<00:01:48.899> biggest<00:01:49.290> gripes<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
commentary so my two biggest gripes and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.940 
commentary so my two biggest gripes and
I've<00:01:50.250> said<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.509> before<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.170> clearly

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I've said one of them before is clearly

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580 
I've said one of them before is clearly
the<00:01:53.070> map<00:01:53.369> size<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> maps<00:01:55.350> are<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the map size I think that the maps are a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.219 
the map size I think that the maps are a
little<00:01:55.799> big<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.670> dull<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.659> far<00:01:58.140> as

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
little big in a little dull as far as

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.780 
little big in a little dull as far as
colors<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.710> they're<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> hard<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> see

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
colors go they're kind of hard to see

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.370 
colors go they're kind of hard to see
people<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.509> they're<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.020> fun<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
people and they're not really fun to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.639 
people and they're not really fun to
look<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:02.460> also<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.540> using<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> map

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
look at but I'm also not using the map

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.469 
look at but I'm also not using the map
size<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> great<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.850> I've<00:02:06.060> said<00:02:06.299> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
size as a great because as I've said in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.900 
size as a great because as I've said in
the<00:02:06.509> past<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.590> least<00:02:08.160> Infinity<00:02:08.700> Ward

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the past it's at least Infinity Ward

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
the past it's at least Infinity Ward
made<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> bold<00:02:09.420> move<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.170> complained<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

absolutely week and you would think that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.920 
absolutely week and you would think that

it's<00:04:32.910> at<00:04:33.030> especially<00:04:33.569> if<00:04:33.690> you're<00:04:33.840> running

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
it's at especially if you're running

dogs Trinity rocket Griffin you're at
five<00:04:37.470> seven<00:04:37.949> ten<00:04:38.220> it's<00:04:38.729> actually<00:04:38.940> really<00:04:39.449> easy

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
five seven ten it's actually really easy

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.719 
five seven ten it's actually really easy
because<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.440> Trinity<00:04:40.770> rocket<00:04:41.129> is<00:04:41.250> three

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
because the Trinity rocket is three

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.399 
because the Trinity rocket is three
rockets<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.389> you're<00:04:42.539> on<00:04:42.629> an<00:04:42.750> open<00:04:42.870> map<00:04:43.229> like

rockets if you're on an open map like

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.200 
rockets if you're on an open map like
this<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.919> probably<00:04:44.280> get<00:04:44.669> all<00:04:44.849> three<00:04:45.180> of

this you can probably get all three of

probably<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.560> sentry<00:05:08.130> gun<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.550> think<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:08.880> would

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
probably a sentry gun I think that would

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.640 
probably a sentry gun I think that would
we<00:05:09.120> have<00:05:09.240> way<00:05:09.449> better<00:05:09.659> kill<00:05:09.990> streak<00:05:10.289> if<00:05:10.470> you're

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
we have way better kill streak if you're

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.460 
we have way better kill streak if you're
inside<00:05:11.130> use<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.060> sentry<00:05:12.479> gun<00:05:12.659> and<00:05:13.139> have<00:05:13.349> it

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
inside use the sentry gun and have it

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.010 
inside use the sentry gun and have it
protect<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:14.009> up<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.430> one<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.610> those<00:05:15.020> tall

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
protect you up in one of those tall

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.870 
protect you up in one of those tall
buildings<00:05:16.050> on<00:05:16.710> sovereign<00:05:17.159> that<00:05:17.310> overlook<00:05:17.729> it

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.950 
don't know how well it is I've gotten it
a<00:05:23.310> couple<00:05:23.490> times<00:05:23.639> in<00:05:24.030> care<00:05:24.240> packages<00:05:24.780> from

from completing field orders which is

i usually get at least one or two with
that<00:05:44.909> trinity<00:05:45.300> rocket<00:05:45.630> it<00:05:45.840> does<00:05:46.050> me<00:05:46.259> well<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:47.009> i

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
that trinity rocket it does me well so i

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.820

keep it equipped in the dog the dog is

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.550 
keep it equipped in the dog the dog is
probably<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.880> best<00:05:51.150> killstreak<00:05:51.479> aside<00:05:52.289> from

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
probably the best killstreak aside from

probably the best killstreak aside from
the<00:05:52.740> Griffin<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.130> Griffins<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.610> best<00:05:53.819> I

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
the Griffin the Griffins the best I

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.779 
the Griffin the Griffins the best I
guess<00:05:54.710> second-tier<00:05:55.710> killstreak<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.370> harder

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
guess second-tier killstreak the harder

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.610 
guess second-tier killstreak the harder
of<00:05:56.819> the<00:05:57.120> kill<00:05:57.330> strings<00:05:57.569> to<00:05:57.719> get<00:05:57.870> anything<00:05:58.289> from

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
of the kill strings to get anything from

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.730 
of the kill strings to get anything from
10<00:05:58.860> on<00:05:59.009> up<00:05:59.190> I'd<00:05:59.400> say<00:05:59.669> um<00:06:00.319> the<00:06:01.319> Griffin

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
10 on up I'd say um the Griffin

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.589 
10 on up I'd say um the Griffin
definitely<00:06:02.159> takes<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.430> cake<00:06:02.520> from<00:06:03.000> 10<00:06:03.240> on<00:06:03.419> up

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
definitely takes the cake from 10 on up

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.930 
definitely takes the cake from 10 on up
unless<00:06:04.409> you're<00:06:04.620> into<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.460> maniac

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
unless you're into the the maniac

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.550 
unless you're into the the maniac
juggernaut<00:06:06.419> but<00:06:06.630> I<00:06:06.659> think<00:06:06.750> you<00:06:07.050> can<00:06:07.080> get<00:06:07.319> more

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
juggernaut but I think you can get more

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.950 
juggernaut but I think you can get more
done<00:06:07.620> with<00:06:08.069> the<00:06:08.190> Griffin<00:06:08.580> then<00:06:09.509> you<00:06:09.659> can<00:06:09.840> with

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
done with the Griffin then you can with

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.350 
done with the Griffin then you can with
a<00:06:09.990> maniac<00:06:10.349> but<00:06:10.860> that<00:06:11.039> dog<00:06:11.279> if<00:06:11.610> you're<00:06:12.180> not

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
a maniac but that dog if you're not
