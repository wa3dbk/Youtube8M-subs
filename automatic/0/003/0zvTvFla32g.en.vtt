Hi everyone, It’s Colleen Patrick-Goudreau
from JoyfulVegan.com.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.400
Welcome to Vegan Point of View.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.720
When you tell people you’re vegan, often
the question that follows is: “Are you vegan

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.119
for health or ethics?” and depending on
your answer, people may respond differently.Here’s

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.660
my point of view.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.989
There are some people who call themselves
“plant-based” are just that -- the BASIS

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.100
of their diet is plants but they’re still
eating some animal products.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.659
And that drives some people -- some vegans
-- crazy.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.239
Honestly, I really have nothing to say to
that other than get over it and focus on the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.930
fact that those people are on a path, they’re
on a journey as we all are, and you’re not

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.370
going to be able to control what people call
themselves.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.729
There are people who call themselves vegan
who eat chicken.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.930
There are people who call themselves vegetarian
who eat fish.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.659
I can’t do anything about that.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.170
“But it confuses the public!

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.630
It distorts what the definition of “vegan”
is.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.630
“

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.630
Yup - - that’s true!

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.420
And good luck trying to control other people
and how they label themselves or self-identify

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.429
-- or the words they use.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.799
All we can do is be the best ambassadors of
compassion as possible.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.710
We can be the best models of living compassionately
as we can.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.560
We can be clear, consistent, compassionate
models of veganism -- and clarify when someone

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.740
misunderstands or misrepresents, but we’ll
never be able to control everyone’s characterization

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.039
or understanding of what it means to be vegan.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.780
And if you try to control that -- I guarantee
you’ll drive yourself crazy and you’ll

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.040
be “that kind of vegan..”

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.889
The other development that’s taken place
regarding the plant-based and vegan dichotomy

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:11.800
is that I’ve noticed that the vegan police
(and I DO have a Food for Thought podcast

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.780
episode called The Vegan Police and I am going
to do a Vegan POV episode on it as well) -- I’ve

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.209
noticed that the vegan police will use the
phrase “plant-based” to cut down someone

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.010
who is clearly vegan but isn’t living up
to the vegan police's perfect vegan standards

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.620
and will thus say “You’re not really vegan;
you’re just plant-based” -- as if to imply

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.370
that it’s really about the food for you
-- not the animals.”

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.819
They’ll say you’re not a “real vegan”
or a “ you're not a true vegan” - you’re

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.150
just plant-based.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.650
I’ve been accused of it on a few posts of
mine, particularly in my episodes and essays

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.540
in which I talk about my cats not being vegan.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.230
Because I’m not convinced that it’s safe
or healthy to feed my cats a 100% vegan diet,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.620
the vegan police responds by saying things
like, “well, you're not a true vegan, you’re

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.409
a speciesist -- you’re not a real vegan
-- you’re really just plant-based.”

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.160
Calling me plant-based rather than “vegan”
is their way of putting me in my place.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.909
Now, I’ve talked a lot about the fact that
imperfection is built into being vegan.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.849
That we live in an imperfect world and that
being vegan is not about trying to attain

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.090
some level of purity or certificate of perfection
-- that it’s about doing the best we can

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.180
to not contribute to the violence against
and suffering of non-human animals when it’s

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.219
possible and practical to do so.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.530
Because of that, that’s why I believe we
can be 100% vegan without being afraid of

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.150
being hypocrites.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.440
Because built into veganism is imperfection,
and thus “I am 100% vegan.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.690
I am imperfect.” is not a contradiction.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.300
Which is why I say to the vegan police accusing
vegans -- who they deem imperfect -- of “not

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.920
being vegan” -- I say phooey.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.489
And to the folks afraid of calling themselves
vegan because they’re afraid of discomfort

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.689
-- I say phooey.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:22.860
Well, I’ll say this, too: all I ask is that
we never say never and remain open.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.750
Open to new possibilities, new information,
new ways of seeing the world, and mostly be

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.020
open to our own compassion.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.880
We need not be afraid of our compassion, and
we need not be afraid of what people think

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.310
because we’re compassionate.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.930
Compassion isn’t something to be afraid
of.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.750
Lack of compassion is.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.060
