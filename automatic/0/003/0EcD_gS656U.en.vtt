00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
jokes are shown and while I didn't

jokes are shown and while I didn't
really<00:02:24.830> laugh<00:02:25.010> per<00:02:25.250> se<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.730> still<00:02:26.150> got

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
really laugh per se I still got

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.970 
really laugh per se I still got
something<00:02:26.660> out<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.319> guess<00:02:27.709> that's<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
something out of it I guess that's the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.350 
something out of it I guess that's the
point<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.280> what<00:02:28.370> auntie<00:02:28.640> humour<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.209> well

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
point of what auntie humour is as well

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
point of what auntie humour is as well
as<00:02:29.510> being<00:02:29.690> predictable<00:02:30.110> or<00:02:30.410> maybe<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.069> just

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
as being predictable or maybe I'm just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.309 
as being predictable or maybe I'm just
old<00:02:31.400> for<00:02:31.580> analysing<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.209> either<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:33.080> it

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
old for analysing this either way it

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.080 
old for analysing this either way it
just<00:02:33.380> felt<00:02:33.709> like<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.890> worked<00:02:34.130> in<00:02:34.490> addition<00:02:35.030> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
just felt like it worked in addition to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.820 
just felt like it worked in addition to
what<00:02:35.270> made<00:02:35.420> Maud<00:02:35.630> pie<00:02:35.870> work<00:02:36.110> as<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> characters

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
what made Maud pie work as a characters

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.680
