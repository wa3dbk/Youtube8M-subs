00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.170
 nowadays it’s hard to imagine what 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.120
 once there was no robot 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.000
 today they successfully work in many 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 industries 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 automotive industry depends entirely on 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 coordinated and accurate work 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.750
 thousand mechanical work market in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.150
 aggressive environments impossible without 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.250
 robots manipulator no production 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.619
 associated with nuclear fuel is not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.330
 not do without recently 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.390
 become more relevant robot 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.920
 able to facilitate the work of special services 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.270
 life savers sappers go to huge risk 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.270
 deactivating explosive devices 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.690
 Research Institute 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.820
 physical and technical problems in Moscow 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.840
 almost 20 years engaged in the creation 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840
 similar units 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.449
 recently from the Russian special services 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 the institute received an order for development 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.350
 inexpensive but responsive 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.239
 modern requirements of the robot 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.739
 capable of neutralizing explosive 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 the device is not only open 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.280
 areas but also in the building so appeared on 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.810
 the light is this remote controlled 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 robotic complex 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.549
 developers christened his mantis robot 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.850
 has a hand holding six 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.350
 degrees of freedom 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 it is also equipped with three cameras 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.909
 infrared ie night vision 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.400
 two cameras are installed in the front and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.979
 rear of housing 1 directly 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.780
 on hand image from these cameras 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.119
 transmitted to the remote monitor 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.890
 control so the operator has 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.830
 the ability to see almost everything 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.930
 space around the robot creating 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.520
 robots of this type to developers 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.060
 you need to give them a lot 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.299
 qualities 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.520
 sometimes mutually exclusive machine for example 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.590
 should be easy and steady grip 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.869
 hands reliable but at the same time very 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.770
 sensitive 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.770
 This design provides 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 rather contradictory quality 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.539
 rolling stock 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:04.170
 it is a high cross on one side 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.170
 and high maneuverability 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.979
 these conflicting qualities get along in 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.530
 Prayer thanks to a unique chassis 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.170
 parts which is a chassis with 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.250
 variable geometry in addition to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.320
 two main support 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.270
 caterpillars robot has four 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:27.940
 independent running gears 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:29.890
 modules the very idea of ​​using happiness 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.950
 with variable geometry she found here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.950
 it is quite original and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.950
 embodiment
