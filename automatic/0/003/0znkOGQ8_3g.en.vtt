00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.830
 let me go 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.949
 Machine is 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.879
 it does not matter, does it 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.879
 He brought me software here 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.259
 scythe 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.259
 I love this boy very much even here 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.979
 what countries 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.429
 should 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.070
 I have 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
 never before her day of death by Kleist 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.510
 but my thoughts are only about him 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 I would never have thought it possible 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.320
 one or the other relationship 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.330
 I even got married but I just could not forget her 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 we are struggling 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.220
 and I thought 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.410
 that all my life I would only live alone 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.630
 I'm sorry 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.650
 because I love someone more than stupid after it's pretty loud 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.750
 which are below 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.150
 clumsy 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 when small children complements Fritz Mauthner 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.420
 now I know 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 that I simply can not imagine a life and love anymore 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.380
 it is not funny 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.150
 I never thought 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.650
 that something like that to me 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 could happen 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 they will forgive me 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.910
 probably will 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.370
 for me is wide open 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.570
 what do you see there 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 that's no joke 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.940
 never say that again 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 one year after Sal Tim k 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.830
 stop it 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.450
 Berlin 04 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.640
 I just want 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 Do not take the first places seriously 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.089
 he could not do it like Franklin 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.089
 here was 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.139
 I did not lie 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.109
 it will be done next year 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.059
 how should I do that 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.829
 after all 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.819
 I am in love 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.239
 and I wish 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.239
 look ahead forever 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.129
 that obliges us to wait more 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.129
 if I only look forward now 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.439
 and if something happens 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.439
 which will bitterly regret 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.499
 I think 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.499
 I will accept it 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.329
 also with it life 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.329
 and beyond 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 Protects to the ground to look forward 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.429
 I really have her 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.969
 stand upright 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:10.810
 Thank you
