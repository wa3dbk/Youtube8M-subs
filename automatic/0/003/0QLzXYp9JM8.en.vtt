for combative use it would have been for

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.260 
for combative use it would have been for
for<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> called<00:01:17.820> hip

I<00:01:54.640> couldn't<00:01:55.640> believe<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.630> was<00:01:56.750> looking<00:01:57.500> at

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
I couldn't believe what I was looking at

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.230 
I couldn't believe what I was looking at
I<00:01:57.950> first<00:01:58.640> saw<00:01:58.939> it<00:01:59.289> from<00:02:00.289> photographs<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:02.210> I

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
I first saw it from photographs and so I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.179 
I first saw it from photographs and so I
knew<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.990> immediately<00:02:03.259> needed<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:04.100> it

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
knew that I immediately needed to see it

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.389 
knew that I immediately needed to see it
in<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.369> flesh<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.960> then<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:06.950> finder

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
in the flesh and then the the finder

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.389 
in the flesh and then the the finder
brought<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.819> down<00:02:07.969> to<00:02:08.300> us<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.160> just

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
brought it down to us and I just

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.650 
brought it down to us and I just
couldn't<00:02:10.640> believe<00:02:10.729> what<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.030> was<00:02:11.090> seeing<00:02:11.450> it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
couldn't believe what I was seeing it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.300 
couldn't believe what I was seeing it
was<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:14.660> extraordinary<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.769> face<00:02:16.069> had

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
was just extraordinary that the face had

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.460 
was just extraordinary that the face had
survived<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.910> such<00:02:17.150> extraordinary<00:02:17.629> condition

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
survived in such extraordinary condition

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.100 
survived in such extraordinary condition
and<00:02:19.090> really<00:02:20.090> I'd<00:02:20.209> never<00:02:20.390> seen<00:02:20.660> anything

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and really I'd never seen anything

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.370 
and really I'd never seen anything
anything<00:02:21.769> like<00:02:22.129> it
