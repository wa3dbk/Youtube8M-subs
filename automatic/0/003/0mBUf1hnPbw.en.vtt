00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
clear I painted in blue in hopes that I

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.050 
clear I painted in blue in hopes that I
can<00:00:41.540> keep<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.990> lot<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.200> light<00:00:42.440> out<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.770> them<00:00:43.060> you

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
can keep a lot of light out of them you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.569 
can keep a lot of light out of them you
really<00:00:44.270> can't<00:00:44.540> see<00:00:45.010> any<00:00:46.010> light<00:00:46.340> blue<00:00:46.550> color

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
really can't see any light blue color

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.330 
really can't see any light blue color
coming<00:00:47.239> out<00:00:47.360> of<00:00:47.390> on<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.900> other<00:00:48.020> in<00:00:48.829> through

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
coming out of on the other in through

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.190 
coming out of on the other in through
here<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.360> there's<00:00:50.540> no<00:00:50.660> sunlight<00:00:50.900> coming

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
here so there's no sunlight coming

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.690 
here so there's no sunlight coming
through<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:51.739> hopefully<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.220> algae<00:00:52.520> won't

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
through so hopefully the algae won't

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.460 
through so hopefully the algae won't
grow<00:00:52.880> so<00:00:53.090> much<00:00:56.560> they<00:00:57.560> have<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:58.809> big<00:00:59.809> cap<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
grow so much they have a big cap on the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.760 
grow so much they have a big cap on the
front<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.870> that's<00:01:02.870> holding<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.380> water<00:01:03.559> back

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
front and that's holding the water back

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.730 
front and that's holding the water back
they<00:01:04.219> have<00:01:04.249> a<00:01:04.639> hinge<00:01:04.999> right<00:01:05.269> here<00:01:05.740> that

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
they have a hinge right here that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.129 
they have a hinge right here that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
of see here and I temporarily piped in

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.920

the<00:02:31.440> water<00:02:31.620> from<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.040> other<00:02:32.190> side<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.819> just<00:02:33.480> ran

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
the water from the other side I just ran

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.869 
the water from the other side I just ran
the<00:02:34.049> downside<00:02:34.530> around<00:02:34.860> because<00:02:35.190> it's<00:02:35.610> getting

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
the downside around because it's getting

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.300 
the downside around because it's getting
kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> dry<00:02:36.299> around<00:02:36.569> here<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.860> live<00:02:38.280> in

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
kind of dry around here I live in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
kind of dry around here I live in
Vancouver<00:02:38.879> Washington<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.900> far<00:02:40.110> from

Vancouver Washington that far from
Portland<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.180> summer<00:02:42.180> time<00:02:42.480> sir<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.019> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
Portland and a summer time sir and that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890 
Portland and a summer time sir and that
late<00:02:43.890> spring<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.640> really<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.269> dry<00:02:45.630> I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
late spring can be really really dry I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.050 
late spring can be really really dry I
just<00:02:46.799> wanted<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.099> use<00:02:47.310> rainwater<00:02:47.549> on<00:02:47.940> my

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
just wanted to use rainwater on my

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.319 
just wanted to use rainwater on my
garden<00:02:48.420> save<00:02:48.750> some<00:02:48.989> money<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.579> I<00:02:50.579> guess<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
garden save some money and I guess this

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.759 
garden save some money and I guess this
is<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> future<00:02:51.810> investment<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.620> really

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
is a future investment on that really

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.309 
is a future investment on that really
saving<00:02:53.040> money<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.459> year<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:54.690> we'll<00:02:55.049> see<00:02:55.200> how

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
saving money this year but we'll see how

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.020 
saving money this year but we'll see how

it goes I am now going to run something
over<00:03:00.329> here<00:03:00.599> because<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.379> water<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.709> obviously

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129
