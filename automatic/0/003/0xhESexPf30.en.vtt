00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.569
 very particular from the taste of the artichoke 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.980
 from the reporter provided by the potato 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.380
 but the beauty is that in this rice not 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.150
 we will find in the potatoes and artichokes internet 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.889
 and wondering ashton giving the numbers 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 but no quiet I would use montuno 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.970
 very very particular really rich of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.039
 fiber mineral salts and vitamins 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.539
 I'm talking about the Jerusalem artichoke you respect 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.279
 has all these features 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.680
 let's see how to prepare the risotto 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.680
 Jerusalem artichoke to prepare this recipe 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.519
 we need ingredients for 4 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.870
 people 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.110
 280 grams of rice, however, the 500 g lots of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 Jerusalem artichoke 2 tablespoons of white wine 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 dried salt and pepper a tuft of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.539

 vegetable broth 30 grams of pecorino

 Roman a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.960
 let's start with the preparation of 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.949
 Jerusalem artichoke I prepared a solution of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 water and lemon juice 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.520
 I put the gloves because otherwise 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 hands became was not quite like i 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.280
 artichokes now prepared Jerusalem artichokes 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:14.159
 near the ravello I went landi 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 to remove all impurities in a 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.280
 all washed and brushed 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 Jerusalem artichoke put it cut into slices 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 as we cut out element in the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.939
 water and lemon solution to avoid 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.070
 oxidation or at least to delay it 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.420
 in the meantime I have also started to warm up 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.689
 of vegetable broth prepared in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.590
 previously soaked i 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 our Jerusalem artichokes we want to drain them 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 done this rather 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 quickly it is just to avoid that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.020
 you become not immediately then we do not shoot 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 inside a small casserole here I have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 already poured a tablespoon of little oil 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.930
 people now we come to fly i 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.930
 our Jerusalem artichokes 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:02.590
 after 23 minutes on a nice bright flame 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:05.229
 add salt and pepper to taste 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.060
 will also save for later 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 at this point we fade with wine 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 dry white ok 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.989
 let's wait a while for the alcohol to evaporate 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.500
 otherwise risotto will know too much about 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:24.579
 head wine of which we will proceed cooking 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.390
 for another 10 15 minutes over low heat e 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.390
 then cover 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.459
 after about 15 minutes the Jerusalem artichokes are 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.870
 practically ready I have them a little 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.569
 mixed well and passed with the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.829
 spoon 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.090
 because then in short one will have to be formed 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.190
 cream 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.579
 meanwhile also raised the flame ea 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.900
 Now let's add the rice it 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:58.989
 we show mix for a minute until 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 to when they will squeak after about one 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.930
 minute 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.690
 we are going to hydrate our rice with the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.480
 vegetable broth should always be made with 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.609
 boil the broth and otherwise if then 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.069
 add the broth which is not very hot 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.959
 the risotto will lose boiling will tend 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.760
 the grain to be two kocan 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.609
 Indoor then eventually turn out 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.239
 it would be nice creamy for a risotto with 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.290
 the flakes 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.299
 we must always mix it very very much 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.870
 often just to facilitate the 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.750
 starch spill from juice not 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.359
 you have to water it too much so don't 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.120
 must swim in the liquid but it must be 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.000
 wet from time to time 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.590
 here is milk every three to four minutes 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.790
 then continue cooking for about 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.989
 12 13 minutes 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.910
 a couple of minutes before the deadline 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.920
 of cooking you see that our nest 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.650
 it's practically ready 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.650
 almost what we do then 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.180
 soak up with pecorino romano 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.750
 if it's too liquid maybe you have 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.489
 wrong doses the name neither 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.570
 worry raise the heat and sell 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:18.940
 time you will see that you will settle everything ok 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.780
 mantechiamo property is no need to 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.780
 come delbono 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.360
 we mix well and then we'll go to 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.870
 serve flavoring also as the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.870
 chopped parsley 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.889
 How about a risotto like this 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.870
 creamy and super light we learn to 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.850
 enhance the kids Jerusalem artichokes and ad 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.960
 come up now with the seventh new construction 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.960
 allies of our health
