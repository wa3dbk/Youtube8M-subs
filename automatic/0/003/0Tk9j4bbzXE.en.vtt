00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
well the traditional cap is basically

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.639 
well the traditional cap is basically
just<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.520> wrap<00:00:38.700> over<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> top<00:00:39.140> bore<00:00:40.140> versus<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.779 
load-bearing cap wear with a Salomon ski
if<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> were<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> take<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.070> core<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> ski

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
if you were to take the core of the ski

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.990 
if you were to take the core of the ski
and<00:00:45.239> remove<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> ski<00:00:47.579> was<00:00:47.730> Hollow

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and remove it so that the ski was Hollow

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
and remove it so that the ski was Hollow
you'd<00:00:48.629> still<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.930> able<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> ski<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.980> okay

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you'd still be able to ski on it okay

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
you'd still be able to ski on it okay
the<00:00:50.550> advantage<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> customer<00:00:52.140> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the advantage that for the customer is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
the advantage that for the customer is
that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> lighter<00:00:53.340> weight<00:00:53.610> ski<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that you get a lighter weight ski you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.360 
that you get a lighter weight ski you
get<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> ski<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.410> extremely<00:00:55.890> good<00:00:56.010> edge

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
get a ski that has extremely good edge

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.020 
get a ski that has extremely good edge
grip<00:00:57.020> but<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.320> still<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:58.980> forgiving<00:00:59.489> okay

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
grip but is still pretty forgiving okay

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
grip but is still pretty forgiving okay
and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.379> talked<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> 3-stone

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

this<00:01:05.970> treatment<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> 3d<00:01:06.750> stealth<00:01:07.080> tip<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
this treatment the 3d stealth tip is a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.460 
this treatment the 3d stealth tip is a
tip<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.490> doesn't<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.270> much<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.750> right

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
tip that doesn't have as much of right

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
tip that doesn't have as much of right
on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> tip<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.390> brought<00:01:12.689> down<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
on the tip to it so it's brought down a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.010 
on the tip to it so it's brought down a
little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.580> doing<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.570> doesn't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
little bit and by doing that it doesn't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
little bit and by doing that it doesn't
deflect<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.130> snow<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.240> tends<00:01:18.509> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
deflect off the snow as much it tends to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
deflect off the snow as much it tends to
hug<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> ground<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.470> little<00:01:19.590> bit<00:01:19.740> better<00:01:20.040> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
hug the ground a little bit better so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
3d stealth tip will help the tip of the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170 
3d stealth tip will help the tip of the
ski<00:01:28.140> hug<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> ground<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.640> create<00:01:29.970> more

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
ski hug the ground and create more

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.929 
ski hug the ground and create more
control<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.079> better<00:01:31.860> edge<00:01:32.100> grip<00:01:32.130> perfect<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
control and better edge grip perfect so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.190 
control and better edge grip perfect so
it's<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.390> angelos<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's going to give that angelos here a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.039 
it's going to give that angelos here a
lot<00:01:34.439> more<00:01:34.619> confidence<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.460> sure<00:01:35.909> okay<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
lot more confidence for sure okay so it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.510
