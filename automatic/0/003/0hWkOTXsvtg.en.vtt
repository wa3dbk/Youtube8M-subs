00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
night not only because when we sleep our

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
night not only because when we sleep our
bodies<00:00:45.539> naturally<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> cool<00:00:46.590> down<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.039> if

perfumed product on your skin before you
go<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.459> bed<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.030> I've<00:02:37.180> used<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.690> few<00:02:38.170> times

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
go to bed so I've used this a few times

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.589 
go to bed so I've used this a few times
already<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.670> you're<00:02:39.849> not<00:02:40.000> restricted<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
already and you're not restricted to

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.960 
already and you're not restricted to
using<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.140> only<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.950> night<00:02:42.160> but<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.579> does<00:02:42.730> work

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
using it only at night but it does work

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.809 
using it only at night but it does work
best<00:02:43.299> at<00:02:43.630> night<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.319> pop<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.860> little<00:02:45.099> bit<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.489> now

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
best at night so pop a little bit on now

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.580 
best at night so pop a little bit on now
so<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.269> looks<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.380> probably

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
so it looks like that that is probably

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.309 
so it looks like that that is probably
way<00:02:48.430> too<00:02:48.489> much<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:49.209> only<00:02:49.360> need<00:02:49.599> about<00:02:49.630> half<00:02:49.989> of

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
way too much you only need about half of

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.350 
way too much you only need about half of
that<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.890> really<00:02:51.310> not<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.579> thick<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.180> I

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
that it's really not that thick and I

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.610 
that it's really not that thick and I
think<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.569> lot<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.720> people<00:02:53.019> think<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> have

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
think a lot of people think to have

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.020 
think a lot of people think to have
something<00:02:53.950> that's<00:02:54.099> gonna<00:02:54.250> really<00:02:54.340> moisturize

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
something that's gonna really moisturize
