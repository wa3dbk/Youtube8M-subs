00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 the black forest cake is a combination 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.899
 perfect whipped cream cherry and chocolate 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.849
 I knew Moorish and we're going today. 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.750
 learn how to make the classic cake of a 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.750
 more fun way 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.530
 good for baking a cake black forest 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.690
 People need a chocolate batter. 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.670
 I made a loaf of bread 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 but you can use your favorite if you 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.900
 I want to change, do other things you think 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.000
 I've done better here, divided into 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.550
 two ways not to have that job 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.080
 cut in half while kneading cools 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 I'm going to do the tail that I'm going to do 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.430
 with a touch of course to leave our 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.199
 cake more in the richer flavor then the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.199
 People are going to put sugar in 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.270
 with the water and then just take the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.280
 when starting to boil with a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.199
 minute and off 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 tell us one minute after it starts 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.330
 to lift the balls that is the hole and there 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 you add the direction of the road 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 because the very heat that is there 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 will stop the alcohol and not 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.590
 will be so strong 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.590
 after you made the tail leaves 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 cooling down a bit at the same time as the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.560
 Mass is going cold and everything else is there 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 You go out to make the whipped cream and just 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 will not be the fresh cream as 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.630
 sugar 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.970
 Just be careful not to let it get too heavy . 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 because it turns butter and butter is good 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.070
 but do not rule out a sour cream 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.070
 fresh 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.170
 the sugar 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.229
 Let's beat him up at speed. 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.229
 medium until you reach the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.310
 This is the point of whipped cream now. 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.100
 People are going to the third step of this cake. 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.570
 which is to make the chocolate shavings all 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.410
 that we need to be here paper 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 butter a ruler a spatula that 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.910
 have this drawing and the chocolate I 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.560
 I'll use the coverage I think more 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.600
 easy to work with is a bit more 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.280
 quick to melt the chocolate after 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.380
 both in the water bath and in the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.910
 microwave microwave because I prefer 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.120
 is a little faster and then have 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.420
 less dishes to wash chocolate 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.350
 melted 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.459
 take your sheet of butter and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.360
 pour the chocolate well in the center so 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.370
 I see with these patrols and I'm pulling 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 to spread it well on the leaf and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.700
 It looks good on the ball that you 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.510
 put another on top it will give a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.510
 pressed down 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.319
 with the second leaf we will put 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.859
 he has been passing his hand over 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.629
 trying to get as much water as possible 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.760
 this effect we will roll to make a 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.250
 roll in the refrigerator for a 10 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.930
 minutes until the chocolate hardens 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.060
 the two sheets and goes rolling 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.609
 he gets a little roll when we 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.159
 take the paper and put it in the refrigerator 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.930
 quickie for him hardened chocolate 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.819
 while the chocolate it hardens 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.769
 We can make the cake then. 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.650
 You're going to win a little bit with 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.879
 syrup to make it taste more 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.900
 use a brush coconut end case 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.900
 easier for you 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.180
 this is something my mom 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.790
 I used to do it when we did. 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.770
 cake she always make the holes and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.350
 spilled tail so he could really 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.920
 penetrate the mass of the cake there gentili 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.920
 fresh cherries 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.210
 and goes with a spatula or a spoon 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.000
 pushing chanti it who cherries 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.770
 I already left them cut off. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.580
 I am clear not to run the risk of 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.120
 Do you know a kid in the middle of the goal? 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.120
 I'll put it here 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:20.230
 and then I put a little of the tail in that 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:21.910
 Also, the top part does not even look there 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.740
 I put whipped cream 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.030
 on the sides of the cake that we're supposed to give 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.030
 the boy 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.380
 and there ends up also a bit of 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.380
 chantilly already chantilly ready chantilly 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.780
 cherries now rafa you get where they are 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.830
 the two sheets together and there it will open 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.720
 only once 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.090
 and you will hear the crepes that are 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.780
 breaking the chocolate then you go 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.780
 open here 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:05:02.730
 and then speak on average a little more or 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.750
 less to the height and it is only and gluing the 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.750
 shave on your cake 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.990
 And then we have a black forest cake. 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.910
 which is a classic almost all round 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.100
 world loves mainly with beer 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.740
 cool it is much more delicious and the 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.650
 shave a touch for you to surprise with 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.850
 a person with a traditional revisited 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.850
 I hope you liked it
