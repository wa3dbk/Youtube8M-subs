00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.360
 What we need is a sponge cake 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.610
 the taste they want then a dish for 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.029
 to be able to present the 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.420
 biscuit a spatula a knife 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.400
 saw to be able to cut it and our 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.800
 filling in this case we are going to occupy a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.950
 chocolate cream bat we look for the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.380
 part of the cake that is lower 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.599
 for example in this case it would be there and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.150
 let's just dial with the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.300
 knife we hold on top 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.370
 and we mark dial is simply 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.160
 perform a ground movement of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 agreement we are marking and turning to the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.420
 time 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.360
 and now that we're on the other side we're going 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.750
 to deepen the cut by the line that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.750
 We perform 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.000
 and we have 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.910
 let's perform exactly the same 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.730
 same step but now to be able to mark 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.730
 and at our levels 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.799
 let's put a little water cream 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.799
 on the presentation plate 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.200
 and we are going to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.200
 paste the cake to turn it 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.510
 we focus well 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.140
 and with the same plate we are going to take out 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140
 a level 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.670
 already with the cake there 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.210
 and ready to fill in let's place the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 toilet who 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.390
 forever 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.390
 we do not watch a bit and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.180
 we place the next floor 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.100
 we take out what we have left 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.979
 and we keep filling 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.010
 and the last floor we put 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.530
 we are well check that it is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.530
 well put the floors 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.000
 we put a weather toilet in the part 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.000
 higher 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.140
 let's stretch it with the water cream 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.140
 towards the shores 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.239
 always the movement of the spatula is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.209
 do not lift it do not take off or drag 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.030
 in a vertical movement simply 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.150
 always going to support the toilet and the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.370
 movement of going up and down is like going 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.560
 dancing with it with the spatula is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.959
 simply a movement with the fingers 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.480
 once completely covered 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.530
 Let cake we leveled we will 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.880
 level by placing the spatula attached to the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.530
 sponge cake and let's go spinning 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.560
 the rotating table 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.480
 we take out the excess and we continue 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.780
 once we have leveled the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.720
 contours 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.990
 we place the spatula straight 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.900
 well and we do inwards all the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.209
 toilet kim left over 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.569
 we go in and the excess what 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.569
 we clean 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.640
 once we have our ready and covered 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.640
 cake we can have two options or 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.650
 we cover it with fondant or on the other hand 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.680
 You can put it in the fridge for about 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.380
 15-20 minutes gives you a coat again 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.330
 of water cream and which allows you 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.970
 make a lÃ©ger cake and you can 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.340
 decorate with pastry bag 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.210
 good friends for now this would be the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.210
 filling a sponge cake
