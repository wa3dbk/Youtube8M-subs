00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.869
 PG cartridges the tar paper and from Canon so the Komik patron 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.150

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.509

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.930
 many special features to look out for 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.040
 again Annette Recker Munich KAP am Fr 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.360
 To catch tons 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.840
 and then we are beautiful 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.080
 The three opening party will be back with our two to three 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 Millions of Bojan work on 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.430
 Explosive 4 percent demanded why unlike the happy ending 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.340

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.480
 in this case the treetops Salama Roma Gaza in the end so still on the left 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.510
 Page so to speak 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390
 on the right is yellow 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.190
 OT is so worthwhile 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.020
 also here when filling 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.440

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.610
 Convey emergencies every drive came 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.880
 wash six milligrams of six Niederense wash 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.730
 because for 6 percent 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.080
 Percent and Lenovo process again small tip 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.830
 if the Bochum no longer wants to get enough intervals are 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.210
 they turn red under the ETA Ops 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.619
 Hundt said Becker accordingly GÃ¼nther here 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.240
 take part again in the enthusiasm 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.670
 Forestier dries up the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.830
 and then around when the pressure on accordingly also has percent 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.200
 and a good constitution 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.080
 SoFFin can refill again three to five times 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.080
 then with a bit of hot glue 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.460
 Again, holding it under the lid makes it easy to finish 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.539
 Again, please do not forget 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.889
 after that 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.009
 quickly used up again 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.579
 Kramer with the forced ventilation again met one hundred percent and 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.939

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.069
 and because this always make sure that they do not have this patronage of the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.800
 bow wave 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800

 Customers we just booked too empty 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.849
 and there stand 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.340
 Furthermore, the big danger was that the Boku customer breaks the fire then 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.869
 through, so to speak 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.239
 and that, of course, is sad 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.169
