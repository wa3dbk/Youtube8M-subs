and we do make a two and a half tip for

and<00:00:44.640> dip<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> flux<00:00:45.660> we're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and dip it in the flux we're going to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.600 
preheating and post heating with cast is
very<00:00:51.390> important<00:00:51.960> however<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.829> our<00:00:52.860> gun<00:00:53.280> it
