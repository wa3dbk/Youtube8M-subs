00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello friends , how are you? 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.320
 in this video we will talk about the size 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.080
 of the aquarium versus the amount of fish 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.029
 to avoid overpopulation 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 there is no universal rule for 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 calculate but safely the quantity 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 of fish 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.039
 the liter of water but we will pass in this 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
 video the basic rule 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 The important thing is to define which fish 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.270
 Let's create and try to understand the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.149
 need of space of each fish 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 so with a water quality is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.829
 important in this rule is to calculate the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.110
 size of which back the size of the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.640
 adult fish and not when the fish is still 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 juvenile 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.039
 some creators some sambistas still 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.890
 calculate with the small fish 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 some people even put a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.600
 fish grows 30 and 40 centimeters and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 one in a small aquarium and then 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.059
 Discard fish, do not do it, let's go 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 first passed the rule of how 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.170
 calculate the water volume of the aquarium 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.510
 we took a centimeter the width to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.229
 depth and height and divide by 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.170
 thousand 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.360
 an example a frame of centimeters per 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.570
 40 of depth and 50 of height we have 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.759
 / 1,200 liters of water 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 but even so when we go 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.820
 use the water volume rule 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.970
 versus the amount of fish 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.790
 we must take into account the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 amount of water free because when 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.470
 the substrate on the bottom of the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.380
 aquarium sand whatever we do 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 put as substratum plants 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
 rocks and wood 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 the trimmings we're going to subtract 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.640
 amount of water 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.630
 the rule for very small fish are 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.649
 five liters of free water plus two 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.640
 liters of water per fish very fish 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.500
 small are gurupi neon mato groso and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 fish of the same size 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.739
 The rule for small fish is 10 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.890
 many free water plus five liters 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.939
 of water for fish as baptism lineses 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.629
 beta and leave the same size for fish 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:30.840
 are 20 liters of free water more 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.599
 15 liters of water per fish with 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.409
 kissing flags and fish of the same 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.260
 for large fish 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:44.010
 40 liters of free water are recommended 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.000
 plus 40 liters of water for each 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.579
 inhabitant as disks and quimbos the rule 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.919
 for jumbo fish are 100 liters of 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.819
 free water but 100 liters of water per 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.780
 inhabitant 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.969
 fish like the oscar the cars and at the end 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.109
 this video leaves a question and how 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.419
 is your aquarium is overpopulated 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.200
 liked the video to share our 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.560
 channel 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.799
 send your questions your questions and even 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.799
