my<00:04:17.840> first<00:04:18.079> trip<00:04:18.290> out<00:04:18.470> on<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.799> r6<00:04:19.370> today<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:19.850> let

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
my first trip out on the r6 today I let

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.140 
my first trip out on the r6 today I let
something<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.290> struck<00:04:21.530> me<00:04:21.650> right<00:04:21.859> away<00:04:21.979> is

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
something that struck me right away is

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.379 
something that struck me right away is
it's<00:04:23.150> still<00:04:24.110> has<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.530> screamer<00:04:25.130> engine<00:04:25.580> but

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
it's still has that screamer engine but

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.900 
it's still has that screamer engine but
what<00:04:26.750> struck<00:04:27.110> me<00:04:27.169> about<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:28.039> r6<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.760> it's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
what struck me about the r6 is that it's

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.010 
what struck me about the r6 is that it's
a<00:04:29.240> racers<00:04:29.840> motorcycle<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:31.010> understand<00:04:31.760> why<00:04:32.630> so

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
a racers motorcycle I understand why so

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.560 
a racers motorcycle I understand why so
many<00:04:33.080> club<00:04:33.979> racers<00:04:34.370> choose<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.880> r6<00:04:35.240> because

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
many club racers choose the r6 because

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.840 
many club racers choose the r6 because
it<00:04:35.690> performs<00:04:36.169> well<00:04:36.340> where<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.400> kind<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.610> wrap

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
it performs well where you kind of wrap

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.640 
it performs well where you kind of wrap
the<00:04:38.060> throttle<00:04:38.419> out<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:38.810> in<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.380> element

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
the throttle out and in that element

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.500 
the throttle out and in that element
you're<00:04:40.310> going<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.639> fast<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:41.210> you're<00:04:41.300> diving

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
you're going that fast and you're diving

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.300 
you're going that fast and you're diving
into<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.930> turns<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.590> front<00:04:42.860> end<00:04:42.979> is<00:04:43.100> well

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
into the turns the front end is well

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.210 
into the turns the front end is well
planted<00:04:44.139> communicates<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.410> lot<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.979> track

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
planted communicates a lot of the track

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.200 
planted communicates a lot of the track
back<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.850> rider

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
back to the rider

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.020 
back to the rider
so<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.199> confident<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.370> it's<00:04:49.520> very<00:04:49.789> much

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
so it's confident but it's very much

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
so it's confident but it's very much
carved<00:04:51.020> from<00:04:51.410> racetrack<00:04:52.190> history<00:04:53.030> yeah<00:04:53.900> this

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
carved from racetrack history yeah this

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.290 
carved from racetrack history yeah this
is<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.199> great<00:04:54.320> track<00:04:54.710> weapon<00:04:55.100> but<00:04:55.430> even<00:04:55.760> here<00:04:56.060> on

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
is a great track weapon but even here on

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.100 
is a great track weapon but even here on
the<00:04:56.570> racetrack

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
the racetrack

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.200 
the racetrack
we<00:04:57.410> noticed<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:57.889> pulling<00:04:58.669> out<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:58.880> some<00:04:59.120> of

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
we noticed that pulling out of some of

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.550 
we noticed that pulling out of some of
the<00:04:59.300> corners<00:04:59.630> when<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.050> gearing<00:05:00.289> is<00:05:00.440> not

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
the corners when the gearing is not

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.070 
the corners when the gearing is not
maximized<00:05:01.099> for<00:05:01.130> each<00:05:01.520> corner<00:05:01.849> that<00:05:02.510> these

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
maximized for each corner that these

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.930 
maximized for each corner that these
other<00:05:03.380> motorcycles<00:05:04.010> pull<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.310> little<00:05:04.610> harder

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
other motorcycles pull a little harder

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.940 
other motorcycles pull a little harder
if<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.150> let<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> revs<00:05:05.660> drop<00:05:05.990> too<00:05:06.200> far<00:05:06.410> down<00:05:06.620> so

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
if you let the revs drop too far down so

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.980 
if you let the revs drop too far down so
it's<00:05:07.490> still<00:05:07.789> one<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.240> prettiest<00:05:08.630> bikes<00:05:08.840> in

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
it's still one of the prettiest bikes in

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.510 
it's still one of the prettiest bikes in
the<00:05:09.080> class<00:05:09.260> especially<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:10.039> new<00:05:10.220> paint

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
the class especially this new paint

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.980 
the class especially this new paint
scheme<00:05:10.610> this<00:05:11.000> year<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> think<00:05:11.690> it<00:05:11.780> looks<00:05:11.930> really

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
scheme this year I think it looks really

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.409 
scheme this year I think it looks really
sharp<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.650> it's<00:05:13.250> easy<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.580> see<00:05:13.729> why<00:05:13.940> somebody

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
sharp and it's easy to see why somebody

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:24.040 
sharp and it's easy to see why somebody
would<00:05:14.570> be<00:05:14.690> attracted<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.229> this<00:05:15.320> bike

one<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.270> places<00:05:38.449> where<00:05:38.840> this<00:05:39.409> CBR<00:05:40.220> Falls<00:05:40.940> a

one of the places where this CBR Falls a
bit<00:05:41.090> short<00:05:41.210> I<00:05:41.659> think<00:05:41.830> especially<00:05:42.830> at<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
bit short I think especially at the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.480 
bit short I think especially at the
racetrack<00:05:43.460> is<00:05:43.940> up<00:05:44.389> top<00:05:44.569> in<00:05:44.900> 2009<00:05:45.830> we<00:05:46.069> found<00:05:46.310> out

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
racetrack is up top in 2009 we found out

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.330 
racetrack is up top in 2009 we found out
that<00:05:46.759> to<00:05:47.000> meet<00:05:47.150> noise<00:05:47.389> emissions<00:05:47.840> regulations

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
that to meet noise emissions regulations

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.189 
that to meet noise emissions regulations
Honda<00:05:49.340> trimmed<00:05:49.639> a<00:05:49.729> bit<00:05:49.879> to<00:05:50.060> power<00:05:50.419> up<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:50.780> top

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199
