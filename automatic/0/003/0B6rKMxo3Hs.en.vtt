00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:23.439
 small bends on bumps 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:27.160
 small stand new stand interrupting set 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.520
 fingers under the wheels then beautiful 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.790
 car and turn off the wheels under the ball 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:42.880
 I will try to support now 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:47.500
 here as she karine it rattles 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.090
 it is the top and there it is clear that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.950
 stuffing box 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.900
 that is not gland boot he 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.920
 passed through 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:03.210
 Well, all the small stands remove and put on you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 personally 19 and remove from the jack to 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:11.500
 clamp clamped bolt this will now 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 unscrew 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.210
 he will try to scroll it 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 condition may be it unscrew by 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.680
 good will not be pumped 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:37.789
 a little bit on this stand 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.439
 that side stabilizer there is a tower for 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.789
 which can hook on hook but also 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:48.579
 the key to unscrew on his new 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.579
 resistant altro what tower did not find 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:06.039
 unscrew and show here, too, the key to 19 and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:06.039
 here and there a well-drawn taking knob 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 knock down well here what the United States also 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.599
 she scrolls but flatters i don't see 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.970
 toilets baby homemade there is still 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.660
 in axis 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.319
 rack holes here such under 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.910
 hexagon 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.400
 I will use this hole now 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.560
 5 millimeter hole 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.650
 hexagons hope that in this rack 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.650
 the same mud is clogged up all the dirt 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.169
 clean it is very important that the depth 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.590
 key is very much gone inside 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:59.959
 if there is a lot of dirt, then the key will not go away 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.760
 inside as it should and can roll 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:08.389
 hexagon in this rack hexagon 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.870
 at 6 millimeters very shallow it 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:15.049
 Come on I'll try to return it now 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.489
 pick up the dirt and this is the maximum 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.489
 pick out from there so that it does not interfere 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.079
 So here we are trying to unscrew 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.129
 then beautiful through 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:56.340
 so here everything is please here is bald 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.500
 which say I don't know on homemade 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.750
 or not on the other hand there is no sooner all 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.190
 Zama homemade that would do something on 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.450
 both sides old new honest 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.890
 I don't know if she has a top or a bottom 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.840
 probably 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.750
 there is no difference how to bet that perfectly 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.479
 same detail 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.959
 symmetry and nowhere is nothing 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.959
 is written 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.220
 we are in this position 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:42.070
 we spin new hot tea bags and min 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.840
 let's use the show near this 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.160
 nut she as you see a little bit 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:54.030
 flattened but on me 18 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:05:00.790
 spanner 18 no cool nut 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:08.800
 key 19 though like 18 key 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:23.020
 on 19 efforts the bad created a borough on 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:26.100
 18 I am dragging on the town personally 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.100
 turn on 18 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.910
 in general, only I want to 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.830
 I'm the only one to add from myself this cannon 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:44.410
 God dammed up with clay and 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:47.580
 hexagon internal doing this for 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.370
 order then if you turn away 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.880
 the thread was not rusty and turned away 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.880
 This is easier 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:21.270
 the bottom nut also closed the clay well 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:23.910
 all put the wheel back and go well 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.960
