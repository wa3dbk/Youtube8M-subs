00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
took a look at the SDK we wondered is it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
took a look at the SDK we wondered is it
actually<00:00:56.370> possible<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.899> nice

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500 
actually possible to have the same nice
animations<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> Apple<00:00:59.730> uses<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.180> their<00:01:00.329> own

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
animations that Apple uses in their own

animations that Apple uses in their own
apps<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.469> those<00:01:01.649> wonder<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.399> moments

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
apps and all those wonder if moments

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
apps and all those wonder if moments
really<00:01:03.210> turned<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:04.019> yes<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> end

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
really turned out to be yes in the end

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980

what's<00:01:05.549> been<00:01:05.760> great<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.450> iphone<00:01:06.810> sdk

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
what's been great about the iphone sdk

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
what's been great about the iphone sdk
is<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.950> allowed<00:01:08.250> us<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
is that allowed us to take the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
is that allowed us to take the
out-of-the-box<00:01:09.900> UI<00:01:10.320> elements<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.490> them

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
out-of-the-box UI elements and use them

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
out-of-the-box UI elements and use them
in<00:01:11.760> our<00:01:11.880> app<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.360> customize<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.290> our

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
in our app then customize it to our

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
in our app then customize it to our
needs<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.790> had<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> develop<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
needs if we had to develop that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
needs if we had to develop that
ourselves<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:16.530> couldn't<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.950> created

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
ourselves we couldn't have created

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
ourselves we couldn't have created
things<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> iphone<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.659> such<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> short

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
things for the iphone in such a short

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
things for the iphone in such a short
time<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:20.280> example<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> checkbox

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
time one example is we have a checkbox

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
time one example is we have a checkbox
next<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> each<00:01:22.740> task<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.729> check<00:01:24.030> off

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
next to each task that you can check off

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
next to each task that you can check off
but<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.750> were<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.080> able<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but we were actually able to make the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
but we were actually able to make the
terrible<00:01:26.520> area<00:01:26.820> bigger<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.780> really

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
terrible area bigger and you can really

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
terrible area bigger and you can really
customize<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> fine<00:01:29.610> details<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.360> every

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
customize the fine details of every

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.160 
customize the fine details of every
aspect<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.530> sdk<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> best

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
aspect of this sdk you can have the best

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
aspect of this sdk you can have the best
software<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> planet<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.520> nobody<00:01:35.880> knows

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
software on the planet but nobody knows

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.120
