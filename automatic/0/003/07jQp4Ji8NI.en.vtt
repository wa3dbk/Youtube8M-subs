that we originally buttered this pan is

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.960 
that we originally buttered this pan is
so<00:01:48.679> that<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.659> syrup<00:01:50.659> as<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.700> bubbles<00:01:52.700> up<00:01:52.819> the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
so that the syrup as it bubbles up the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.420 

the<00:02:25.780> last<00:02:26.080> thing<00:02:26.410> we're<00:02:26.740> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.920> add<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the last thing we're going to add to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.320 
the last thing we're going to add to
this<00:02:27.550> mixture<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.550> half<00:02:30.760> teaspoons

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
this mixture is one and a half teaspoons

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.940 
this mixture is one and a half teaspoons
of<00:02:31.540> baking<00:02:31.900> soda<00:02:32.260> now<00:02:32.470> you're<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.770> see

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
of baking soda now you're going to see

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.980 
of baking soda now you're going to see
quite<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.190> reaction<00:02:33.400> when<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.940> add<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
quite a reaction when I add this the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.780 
quite a reaction when I add this the
peanut<00:02:38.290> brittle<00:02:38.410> will<00:02:38.710> start<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.130> foam<00:02:39.460> and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
peanut brittle will start to foam and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.510 
peanut brittle will start to foam and
bubble<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:41.320> is<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> wonderful<00:02:42.100> technique

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
bubble up this is a wonderful technique

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.640 
bubble up this is a wonderful technique
in<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.480> peanut<00:02:43.810> brittle<00:02:43.960> because<00:02:44.320> what<00:02:44.470> this

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
in the peanut brittle because what this

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.190 
in the peanut brittle because what this
does<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.970> will<00:02:46.090> allow<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.480> peanut<00:02:47.110> brittle

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
does is it will allow the peanut brittle

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.660 
does is it will allow the peanut brittle
to<00:02:47.470> be<00:02:47.590> nice<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.160> tender<00:02:50.490> we're<00:02:51.490> going<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
to be nice and tender we're going to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.230 
to be nice and tender we're going to
pour<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:53.550> sheet<00:02:54.550> pan<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.060> has

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
pour this on to a sheet pan that has

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.010 
pour this on to a sheet pan that has
been<00:02:55.270> buttered<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.540> want<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.870> this

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
been buttered and you want to do this

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.710 
been buttered and you want to do this
relatively<00:03:02.800> quickly<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.880> caramel

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
relatively quickly so that the caramel

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.960 
relatively quickly so that the caramel
does<00:03:07.900> not<00:03:08.080> continue<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.710> cook<00:03:09.070> or<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.700> peanut

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
does not continue to cook or the peanut

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.630 
does not continue to cook or the peanut
brittle<00:03:10.060> does<00:03:10.330> not<00:03:10.480> continue<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.960> cook<00:03:11.140> in<00:03:11.320> her

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
brittle does not continue to cook in her

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.920 
brittle does not continue to cook in her
you<00:03:12.640> don't<00:03:12.730> need<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.030> spread<00:03:13.240> that<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.480> it'll

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
you don't need to spread that out it'll

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.070 
you don't need to spread that out it'll
just<00:03:14.310> spread<00:03:15.310> out<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.640> its<00:03:15.820> own<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.690> our<00:03:16.750> peanut

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
just spread out on its own so our peanut

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.660 
just spread out on its own so our peanut
brittle<00:03:17.230> has<00:03:17.710> set<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.040> room<00:03:18.160> temperature<00:03:18.640> for

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
brittle has set at room temperature for

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.420 
brittle has set at room temperature for
about<00:03:18.880> an<00:03:19.120> hour<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.660> nice<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.050> cool<00:03:20.290> at<00:03:21.220> this

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
about an hour it's nice and cool at this

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.030 
about an hour it's nice and cool at this
point<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:21.970> time<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.240> break<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.540> up<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:23.040> in

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
point it's time to break it up so in

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.190 
point it's time to break it up so in
this<00:03:24.220> sheet<00:03:24.430> pan<00:03:24.670> like<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.390> usually<00:03:26.080> will

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
this sheet pan like this I usually will

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.440 
this sheet pan like this I usually will
just<00:03:26.520> pop<00:03:27.520> it<00:03:27.670> on<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.820> edge<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.270> counter

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
just pop it on the edge of the counter

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.560 
just pop it on the edge of the counter
you<00:03:28.660> can<00:03:28.750> see<00:03:28.990> how<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.670> all<00:03:30.670> came<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:31.360> this

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
you can see how it all came up like this

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.260 
you can see how it all came up like this
the<00:03:31.990> next<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> fun<00:03:32.650> part

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
the next is the fun part

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.790 
the next is the fun part
break<00:03:34.270> it<00:03:34.420> up<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:35.680> like<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:37.560> that's<00:03:38.560> how

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
break it up just like that that's how

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.580 
break it up just like that that's how
you<00:03:38.830> make<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.100> peanut<00:03:39.400> brittle
