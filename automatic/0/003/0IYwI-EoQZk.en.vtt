here good five cars i'm gonna test in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.890 
here good five cars i'm gonna test in
the<00:01:04.920> trap<00:01:06.530> man<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:09.479> Kentucky<00:01:09.979> okay

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
the trap man with it this Kentucky okay

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
the trap man with it this Kentucky okay
let's<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.229> rides<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:14.070> ready<00:01:14.850> set

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
let's see how this rides down ready set

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.539 
let's see how this rides down ready set
go<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:18.630> pretty<00:01:18.930> nice<00:01:19.140> big<00:01:19.740> big<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> see

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
go it's pretty nice big big so you see

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.060 
go it's pretty nice big big so you see
the<00:01:23.820> lighter<00:01:24.240> cars<00:01:24.630> might<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.350> faster<00:01:25.920> than

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the lighter cars might go faster than

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
the lighter cars might go faster than
these<00:01:26.280> heavier<00:01:26.610> color<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.270> well<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> could

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
these heavier color here well it could

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
these heavier color here well it could
be<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.590> other<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.759> course<00:01:33.030> pretty

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
be the other way so this course pretty

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.510 
be the other way so this course pretty
heavy<00:01:34.310> no<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.420> pause

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
heavy no you know how will pause

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
heavy no you know how will pause
basically<00:01:39.409> maybe<00:01:40.409> almost<00:01:40.829> silly<00:01:42.020> let's<00:01:43.020> set

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
basically maybe almost silly let's set

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.120 
basically maybe almost silly let's set
this<00:01:43.470> car

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.450 

well<00:01:47.130> certainly<00:01:48.830> had<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:49.860> different<00:01:50.280> lead

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
well certainly had a different lead

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120 
well certainly had a different lead
often<00:01:51.000> swim<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.660> box<00:01:51.990> over<00:01:52.230> there<00:01:52.410> like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
often swim to the box over there like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.860 
often swim to the box over there like
this<00:01:53.370> morning<00:01:53.910> did<00:01:54.980> because<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.130> wonder<00:01:56.370> said

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
this morning did because I wonder said

card<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.700> let's<00:03:00.510> try<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.810> last<00:03:01.080> car<00:03:02.120> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
card it so let's try the last car this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.050 
card it so let's try the last car this
car<00:03:03.270> has<00:03:03.770> good<00:03:04.770> fun<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> front<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:05.910> nice

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
car has good fun for the front so nice

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.340 
car has good fun for the front so nice
and<00:03:06.270> heavy<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.260> go<00:03:07.620> faster<00:03:08.959> once<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.140> light

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and heavy so I go faster once a light

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.550 
and heavy so I go faster once a light
blue<00:03:10.590> car<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.220> has<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> heavy<00:03:11.760> air<00:03:12.060> back<00:03:12.560> so

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
blue car it has a heavy air back so

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.650 
blue car it has a heavy air back so
probably<00:03:14.010> hold<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.430> back<00:03:14.550> more<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.650> what<00:03:17.660> sure

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
probably hold it back more so what sure

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.600 
probably hold it back more so what sure
let's<00:03:18.930> go<00:03:20.630> that's<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.350> my<00:03:22.739> turpin<00:03:23.280> were

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
let's go that's it so my turpin were

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.840 
let's go that's it so my turpin were
light<00:03:24.440> cause<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.769> heavier<00:03:26.160> fight<00:03:26.489> scene

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
light cause with the heavier fight scene

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.710 
light cause with the heavier fight scene
2<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:28.220> went<00:03:29.220> faster<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:32.030> sit<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.480> box

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
2 of went faster and sit the box

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.310 
2 of went faster and sit the box
actually<00:03:34.310> see<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.489> car<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:36.060> very<00:03:36.840> light<00:03:37.140> at

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
actually see this car is very light at

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.750 
actually see this car is very light at
the<00:03:37.350> front<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.340> has<00:03:38.570> big<00:03:39.570> wheels<00:03:39.989> and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the front but it has big wheels and

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.630 
the front but it has big wheels and
high-density<00:03:41.760> metal<00:03:42.450> at<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.840> bat<00:03:43.400> they<00:03:44.400> like

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
high-density metal at the bat they like

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.870 
high-density metal at the bat they like
the<00:03:44.670> open<00:03:45.209> now<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.660> your<00:03:45.750> front<00:03:46.580> see<00:03:47.580> if<00:03:47.640> you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
the open now in your front see if you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.340 
the open now in your front see if you
can<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.239> through<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.570> window<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:50.670> can

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
can see through that window that we can

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.140 
can see through that window that we can
camera<00:03:51.710> but<00:03:52.700> yes<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:54.320> is<00:03:54.680> not<00:03:55.070> high<00:03:55.520> density

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
camera but yes it is not high density

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150 
camera but yes it is not high density
and<00:03:56.330> back<00:03:56.630> then<00:03:56.900> big<00:03:57.260> metal<00:03:57.650> piece<00:03:57.830> right<00:03:58.130> here

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
and back then big metal piece right here

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.530 
and back then big metal piece right here
but<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.720> I<00:04:00.080> probably<00:04:00.860> fact<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.550> all<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.330> other

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
but so I probably fact it all the other

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.590 
but so I probably fact it all the other
cars<00:04:02.750> had<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:04.390> slanted<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:06.260> forward<00:04:06.680> part<00:04:06.890> so

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
cars had a slanted the forward part so

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:17.260 
cars had a slanted the forward part so
probably<00:04:08.600> went<00:04:08.810> down<00:04:10.780> yeah<00:04:12.970> ok<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:16.000> what<00:04:17.000> see

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
probably went down yeah ok so what see

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.710 
probably went down yeah ok so what see
