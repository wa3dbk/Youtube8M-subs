00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
and just that you know combat is a huge

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.450 
and just that you know combat is a huge
component<00:00:39.289> of<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.739> but<00:00:39.979> you<00:00:40.159> know<00:00:40.190> there's

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
it seems like it's definitely something

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.509 
it seems like it's definitely something
that<00:00:44.269> Capcom<00:00:44.780> would<00:00:45.350> be<00:00:45.469> interested<00:00:45.920> in<00:00:45.979> get

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
that Capcom would be interested in get

the<00:00:46.639> demo<00:00:46.819> we<00:00:47.120> saw<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.690> gamescom<00:00:48.319> it<00:00:48.620> looked

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
the demo we saw it gamescom it looked

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.340 
the demo we saw it gamescom it looked
like<00:00:49.219> just<00:00:49.429> kind<00:00:49.639> of<00:00:49.670> button<00:00:49.879> mash<00:00:50.149> e<00:00:50.179> but<00:00:50.899> they

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
like just kind of button mash e but they

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.759 
like just kind of button mash e but they
didn't<00:00:52.010> release<00:00:52.399> deeper<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:53.329> dive<00:00:53.629> into<00:00:53.989> how<00:00:54.739> a

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
didn't release deeper to dive into how a

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.949 
didn't release deeper to dive into how a
combo<00:00:55.190> system<00:00:55.339> works<00:00:55.699> right<00:00:55.999> and<00:00:56.239> it's<00:00:56.449> pretty

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:56.959 
combo system works right and it's pretty

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.139 
combo system works right and it's pretty
insane<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.799> basics<00:00:58.249> are<00:00:58.429> combats

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
insane the basics are combats

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.579 
insane the basics are combats
constructed<00:00:59.780> out<00:00:59.899> of<00:00:59.929> these<00:01:00.139> things<00:01:00.350> that

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
constructed out of these things that

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.559 
constructed out of these things that
they're<00:01:00.739> calling<00:01:01.159> pressings<00:01:01.639> basically<00:01:02.420> each

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
they're calling pressings basically each

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.450 
they're calling pressings basically each
combo<00:01:02.959> is<00:01:03.049> made<00:01:03.199> up<00:01:03.319> of<00:01:03.409> a<00:01:03.559> button<00:01:03.829> press<00:01:04.129> those

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
combo is made up of a button press those

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.460 
combo is made up of a button press those
mutton<00:01:04.790> presses<00:01:05.150> have<00:01:05.600> different<00:01:05.960> attributes

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
mutton presses have different attributes

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.200 
mutton presses have different attributes
so<00:01:06.680> like<00:01:06.860> one<00:01:07.070> might<00:01:07.340> reach<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:07.880> your<00:01:07.910> health

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
so like one might reach in your health

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.780 
so like one might reach in your health
or<00:01:08.420> another<00:01:08.990> one<00:01:09.200> might<00:01:09.440> set<00:01:09.770> up<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:10.100> finishing

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
or another one might set up a finishing

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.520 
or another one might set up a finishing
move<00:01:10.910> for<00:01:11.480> an<00:01:11.660> enemy<00:01:11.990> or<00:01:12.020> one<00:01:12.290> does<00:01:12.500> more

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
move for an enemy or one does more

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.800 
move for an enemy or one does more
damage<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.490> can<00:01:13.610> do<00:01:13.760> like<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.210> think<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.600> said
