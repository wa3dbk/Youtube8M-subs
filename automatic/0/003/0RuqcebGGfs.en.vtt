00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
the inside of the wreath so we'll start

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.089 
the inside of the wreath so we'll start
with<00:02:52.099> making<00:02:52.519> some<00:02:52.730> more<00:02:52.910> holes<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:57.099> taking

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
with making some more holes and taking

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.670 
with making some more holes and taking
one<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.549> varieties<00:02:59.090> and<00:03:00.080> moving<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.470> little

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
one of the varieties and moving a little

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.070 
one of the varieties and moving a little
bit<00:03:00.769> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.980> soil<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:06.160> slugging<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.250> down<00:03:07.489> in

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
bit of the soil and slugging it down in

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.680 
bit of the soil and slugging it down in
and<00:03:09.080> pushing<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:09.980> around<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:11.420> would<00:03:11.510> use<00:03:11.660> that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
and pushing it around you would use that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.740 
and pushing it around you would use that
same<00:03:12.170> color<00:03:12.500> down<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.329> same<00:03:14.480> color
