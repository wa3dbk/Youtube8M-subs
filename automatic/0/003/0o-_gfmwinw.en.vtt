the<00:00:00.329> story<00:00:00.570> really<00:00:00.750> starts<00:00:01.199> when<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:02.250> started

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
the story really starts when we started

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.980 
the story really starts when we started
going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.820> Peru<00:00:03.000> so<00:00:03.689> there<00:00:03.840> were<00:00:03.899> these

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
going to Peru so there were these

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.990 
going to Peru so there were these
incredible<00:00:04.560> fossils<00:00:05.040> we<00:00:05.190> first<00:00:05.430> discovered

incredible fossils we first discovered
them<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.210> 2006<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:08.450> started<00:00:09.450> changing<00:00:09.660> our

I was lucky enough right near one of the
wings<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.939> uncover<00:01:12.470> what<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.860> clearly<00:01:14.250> the

it's our first insight into what are the

it's our first insight into what are the

feathering closer to this transition to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
feathering closer to this transition to

shows<00:01:30.299> us<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.970> modifications<00:01:32.970> occurred

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
shows us is that modifications occurred

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450
