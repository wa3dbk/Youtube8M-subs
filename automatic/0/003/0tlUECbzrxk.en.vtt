00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
where the pieces come off and go back on

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.680 
where the pieces come off and go back on
I'll<00:02:35.739> probably<00:02:36.040> break<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:39.280> way<00:02:39.690> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
