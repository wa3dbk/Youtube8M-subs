00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
I think it's gonna be it's gonna have a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
I think it's gonna be it's gonna have a
really<00:00:40.350> crispy<00:00:41.070> feel<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.460> looks<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
really crispy feel it looks like a you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.630 
really crispy feel it looks like a you
long<00:00:42.270> yeah<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.050> pretty<00:00:43.230> nice<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.250> same

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
long yeah it's pretty nice it's the same

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
long yeah it's pretty nice it's the same
size<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.899> bigger<00:00:46.140> than<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
size it's a little bit bigger than a you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
size it's a little bit bigger than a you
long<00:00:47.520> actor<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.539> longer<00:00:48.840> here

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
long actor so this is a you longer here

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
long actor so this is a you longer here
so<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.640> slightly<00:00:50.940> larger

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
so as you can see it's slightly larger

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.360 
so as you can see it's slightly larger
than<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> probably<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.739> 57

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
than that and this is probably like 57

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.630 
than that and this is probably like 57
millimeters<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.210> maybe<00:00:54.390> even<00:00:54.510> 50<00:00:54.989> 58<00:00:55.640> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
millimeters or maybe even 50 58 so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.330 
millimeters or maybe even 50 58 so
alright<00:00:56.820> let's<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.480> germs<00:01:01.309> yeah<00:01:02.309> I

about like how it turns actually I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
about like how it turns actually I
probably<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> lube<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.590> can

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
pulled out one half of the edge piece I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.100 
pulled out one half of the edge piece I
wonder<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> back

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it has really nice turning and it does

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
it has really nice turning and it does
feel<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.049> speak<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
feel like I speak you because it's a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
feel like I speak you because it's a
shape<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.759> I've<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.770> has<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
shape but I've one like this one has a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
shape but I've one like this one has a
shape<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> ICU<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.119> turns<00:02:03.329> very

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
shape out of the ICU so it turns very

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.300 
shape out of the ICU so it turns very
nicely<00:02:03.899> terms<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> house<00:02:04.979> soon

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
nicely terms just like the house soon

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.270 
nicely terms just like the house soon
and<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.759> very<00:02:06.060> fun<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> solve<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> I'm<00:02:07.979> hoping

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and it's very fun to solve so I'm hoping

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559 
and it's very fun to solve so I'm hoping
this<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:08.729> fun<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.090> solve<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.420> well

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this one is really fun to solve as well

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.980 
this one is really fun to solve as well
this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.830> middle<00:02:11.280> layer<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.900> then

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
this is a middle layer and then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.250 
this is a middle layer and then
this<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:14.130> face<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.780> center's<00:02:16.110> are

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
this is one face so the center's are

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
this is one face so the center's are
this<00:02:16.950> white<00:02:17.280> center<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.000> yellow<00:02:18.240> center

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
this white center or this yellow center

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.260 
this white center or this yellow center
and<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.230> these<00:02:19.620> four<00:02:19.680> side<00:02:20.430> centers<00:02:20.880> have

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
and then these four side centers have

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.810 
and then these four side centers have
different<00:02:21.810> colors<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.370> each<00:02:23.370> Center<00:02:23.670> has

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
different colors like each Center has

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.150 
different colors like each Center has
two<00:02:24.030> colors<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.960> one<00:02:25.140> Center<00:02:25.500> and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
two colors so this is one Center and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.230 
two colors so this is one Center and
then<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:28.440> edge<00:02:28.620> piece<00:02:28.680> has<00:02:29.280> three<00:02:29.610> colors<00:02:29.820> so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
then this edge piece has three colors so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.080 
then this edge piece has three colors so
that's<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.440> interesting<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.700> looks

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
that's really interesting and it looks

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's really interesting and it looks
really<00:02:33.330> fun<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.750> solve<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:34.740> gonna<00:02:34.830> go

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
really fun to solve so I'm just gonna go

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760 
really fun to solve so I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.250> scramble<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.820> up<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.560> can

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
ahead and scramble it up so that I can

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.650 
ahead and scramble it up so that I can
see<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.460> solve<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> shape

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
see if I can solve it it is a shape

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.560 
see if I can solve it it is a shape
matzo<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.070> I'm<00:02:44.730> pretty<00:02:45.060> sure<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.330> solve

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
matzo it's you I'm pretty sure you solve

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.180 
matzo it's you I'm pretty sure you solve
it<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.080> 3x3<00:02:46.530> shouldn't<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:46.980> that

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it just like a 3x3 shouldn't be that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.850 
it just like a 3x3 shouldn't be that
hard<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.820> shouldn't<00:02:48.210> require<00:02:48.420> any<00:02:48.860> extra

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
hard and you shouldn't require any extra

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.430 
hard and you shouldn't require any extra
algorithms<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:51.750> kind<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.960> weird<00:02:52.200> just

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
algorithms and it's kind of weird just

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.010 
algorithms and it's kind of weird just
like<00:02:52.590> aligning<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.310> puzzle<00:02:53.700> cuz<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.180> hard

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
like aligning this puzzle cuz it's hard

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.350 
like aligning this puzzle cuz it's hard
to<00:02:55.110> figure<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.380> where<00:02:55.560> each<00:02:55.620> piece<00:02:56.070> goes

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
to figure out where each piece goes

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
to figure out where each piece goes
that's<00:02:57.360> only<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.050> new<00:02:58.170> puzzle

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
that's only because it's a new puzzle

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.350 
that's only because it's a new puzzle
but<00:02:58.680> once<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.010> keep<00:02:59.490> playing<00:02:59.730> with<00:02:59.880> your<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.210> bit

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
but once I keep playing with your a bit

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.990 
but once I keep playing with your a bit
I<00:03:00.390> shouldn't<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:00.840> used<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
I shouldn't get used to it so the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.870 
I shouldn't get used to it so the
turning<00:03:06.360> for<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> very<00:03:07.110> nice<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.620> turns

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
turning for this is very nice it turns

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.960 
turning for this is very nice it turns
just<00:03:08.880> like<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.360> long<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.770> very<00:03:11.160> easy<00:03:11.820> to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
just like a you long it is very easy to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.800 
just like a you long it is very easy to
turn<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.510> very<00:03:12.750> few<00:03:13.110> very<00:03:13.380> nice<00:03:14.600> but<00:03:15.600> it's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
turn it and very few very nice but it's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.810 
turn it and very few very nice but it's
just<00:03:15.990> that<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:16.980> hard<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.430> speak<00:03:17.640> to

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
just that it's really hard to speak to

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.280 
just that it's really hard to speak to
you<00:03:17.880> because<00:03:18.210> it's<00:03:18.450> kind<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.690> hard<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.080> line

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you because it's kind of hard to on line

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.320 
you because it's kind of hard to on line
all<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.710> layers<00:03:19.920> cuz<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:20.640> smooth<00:03:21.150> that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
all the layers cuz it's so smooth that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.240 
all the layers cuz it's so smooth that
all<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.690> layers<00:03:21.900> want<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.290> move<00:03:22.440> at<00:03:22.590> once<00:03:22.830> so

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
all the layers want to move at once so

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.220 
all the layers want to move at once so
it's<00:03:23.370> hard<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> keep<00:03:24.240> them<00:03:24.420> all<00:03:24.570> aligned<00:03:24.930> when

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
it's hard to keep them all aligned when

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.620 
it's hard to keep them all aligned when
you<00:03:25.260> only<00:03:25.500> want<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.860> move<00:03:25.980> one<00:03:26.220> face<00:03:26.570> Bao<00:03:27.570> Zhu

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
you only want to move one face Bao Zhu

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.570 
you only want to move one face Bao Zhu
Yue<00:03:28.050> Liang<00:03:28.230> was<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.740> fun<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.130> wasn't<00:03:29.400> too

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
Yue Liang was really fun it wasn't too

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.400 
Yue Liang was really fun it wasn't too
hard<00:03:29.820> but<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.240> wasn't<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:30.720> easy<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.200> well

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
hard but it wasn't really easy as well

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.470 
hard but it wasn't really easy as well
so<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.980> thought<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.430> was<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.150> perfect

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
so I thought it was like the perfect

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.860 
so I thought it was like the perfect
difficulty<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.650> someone<00:03:35.460> who's<00:03:35.640> like

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
difficulty for someone who's like

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.210 
difficulty for someone who's like
intermediate<00:03:36.870> level<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.560> shape<00:03:37.770> mods<00:03:38.010> like

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
intermediate level for shape mods like

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.860 
intermediate level for shape mods like
me<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.030> thought<00:03:39.240> I<00:03:39.270> was<00:03:39.330> really<00:03:39.450> found<00:03:39.690> my

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
me so I thought I was really found my

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.070 
me so I thought I was really found my
first<00:03:40.140> 4x4<00:03:41.060> shape-shifting<00:03:42.060> puzzles<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.750> I

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
first 4x4 shape-shifting puzzles so I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.860 
first 4x4 shape-shifting puzzles so I
really<00:03:43.350> like<00:03:43.530> solving<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.420> have<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> few

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
really like solving this I have a few

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.740 
really like solving this I have a few
theory<00:03:46.680> shape<00:03:46.860> mods<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.820> is<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.570> is

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
theory shape mods and this is this is

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.810 
theory shape mods and this is this is
another<00:03:48.930> one<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.680> shouldn't<00:03:50.520> be<00:03:50.610> that

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
another one so you shouldn't be that

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.930 
another one so you shouldn't be that
hard<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.120> solve<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.980> I'll<00:03:52.980> try<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.250> solve<00:03:53.580> some

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
hard to solve and I'll try to solve some

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.960 
hard to solve and I'll try to solve some
parts<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:55.740> first<00:03:55.770> I'd<00:03:56.160> have<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.670> line

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
parts the first I'd have to do line

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.380 
parts the first I'd have to do line
centers<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.890> should<00:03:59.070> be<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.490> one<00:03:59.850> move

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
centers that should be just one move

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.890 
centers that should be just one move
each<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.730> here<00:04:03.060> are<00:04:03.180> all<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.390> center's

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
each so here are all the center's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.270 
each so here are all the center's
aligned<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:06.510> looks<00:04:06.810> like<00:04:07.140> an<00:04:07.290> axis<00:04:07.800> qubit

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
aligned and it looks like an axis qubit

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.730 
aligned and it looks like an axis qubit
you<00:04:08.640> like<00:04:08.790> some<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.150> pieces<00:04:09.330> are<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:10.620> an

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
you like some of the pieces are like an

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.470 
you like some of the pieces are like an
axis<00:04:11.130> cube<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.640> when<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:11.850> first<00:04:12.060> looked<00:04:12.300> at<00:04:12.360> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
axis cube and when I first looked at I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.760 
axis cube and when I first looked at I
thought<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.780> was<00:04:12.870> an<00:04:12.960> accident

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
thought it was an accident

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.849 
thought it was an accident
it<00:04:13.980> looked<00:04:14.340> very<00:04:14.520> familiar<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.420> shape<00:04:15.859> it

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
it looked very familiar the shape it

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.979 
it looked very familiar the shape it
looks<00:04:17.040> like<00:04:17.160> an<00:04:17.250> axis<00:04:17.640> cube<00:04:17.940> mixed<00:04:18.420> with<00:04:18.750> like

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
looks like an axis cube mixed with like

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.620 
looks like an axis cube mixed with like
another<00:04:19.410> puzzle<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:23.460> here<00:04:23.700> I've<00:04:23.790> got<00:04:23.820> okay

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
another puzzle so here I've got okay

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.659 
another puzzle so here I've got okay
this<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.020> wrong

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
this is wrong

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.279 
this is wrong
okay<00:04:26.599> so<00:04:27.759> you<00:04:28.759> have<00:04:28.909> to<00:04:29.060> also<00:04:29.240> align<00:04:29.719> the<00:04:30.110> white

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
okay so you have to also align the white

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.770 
okay so you have to also align the white
and<00:04:30.499> yellow<00:04:30.620> centers<00:04:31.069> they<00:04:31.669> look<00:04:31.969> it<00:04:32.569> looks

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
and yellow centers they look it looks

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.119 
and yellow centers they look it looks
like<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.169> just<00:04:33.439> normal<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.069> it's<00:04:34.879> not<00:04:36.129> it's

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
like it's just normal but it's not it's

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.029 
like it's just normal but it's not it's
actually<00:04:37.310> wrong<00:04:37.699> because<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.620> center<00:04:39.889> is

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
actually wrong because the the center is

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.730 
actually wrong because the the center is
on<00:04:40.159> an<00:04:40.340> angle<00:04:40.550> it's<00:04:41.120> not<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:41.629> flat<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:42.469> it's

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
on an angle it's not like flat so it's

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.409 
on an angle it's not like flat so it's
really<00:04:42.889> that's<00:04:43.610> really<00:04:43.819> cool<00:04:43.969> I'll<00:04:44.150> probably

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
really that's really cool I'll probably

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.869 
really that's really cool I'll probably
have<00:04:44.659> a<00:04:44.689> small<00:04:44.930> video<00:04:45.139> on<00:04:45.319> this<00:04:45.409> later<00:04:45.469> and<00:04:45.979> if

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
have a small video on this later and if

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.459 
have a small video on this later and if
you're<00:04:47.029> wondering<00:04:47.150> about<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.479> su<00:04:47.900> yi<00:04:48.259> lang

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
you're wondering about the su yi lang

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.429 
you're wondering about the su yi lang
then<00:04:49.129> I<00:04:49.159> have<00:04:49.729> an<00:04:50.479> unboxing<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:51.080> this<00:04:51.259> but<00:04:51.409> I

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:51.439 
then I have an unboxing on this but I

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.899 
then I have an unboxing on this but I
haven't<00:04:51.740> uploaded<00:04:51.949> it<00:04:52.249> I<00:04:52.370> really<00:04:52.610> like<00:04:52.759> this

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
haven't uploaded it I really like this

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.309 
haven't uploaded it I really like this
puzzle<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.360> I'll<00:04:53.479> probably<00:04:53.689> make<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.930> review<00:04:54.139> on

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
puzzle so I'll probably make a review on

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.230 
puzzle so I'll probably make a review on
this<00:04:54.439> I<00:04:54.650> might<00:04:55.189> even<00:04:55.310> make<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.550> review<00:04:55.879> on<00:04:56.029> this

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
this I might even make a review on this

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.269 
this I might even make a review on this
so<00:04:56.509> yeah<00:04:56.599> that's<00:04:56.749> it<00:04:56.900> for<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.110> video<00:04:57.319> guys<00:04:57.499> my

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
so yeah that's it for this video guys my

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.399 
so yeah that's it for this video guys my
first<00:04:58.520> impressions<00:04:58.969> of<00:04:59.300> this<00:04:59.479> are<00:04:59.719> great<00:05:00.110> I

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
first impressions of this are great I

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.469 
first impressions of this are great I
love<00:05:01.039> this<00:05:01.159> cube<00:05:01.460> right<00:05:01.669> out<00:05:01.819> of<00:05:01.879> the<00:05:02.000> box<00:05:02.270> it

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
love this cube right out of the box it

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.839 
love this cube right out of the box it
turns<00:05:02.750> very<00:05:02.870> nicely<00:05:03.319> and<00:05:03.800> it's<00:05:04.340> very<00:05:04.550> smooth

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
turns very nicely and it's very smooth

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.879 
turns very nicely and it's very smooth
to<00:05:05.029> turn<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.419> only<00:05:05.810> thing<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:06.050> it's<00:05:06.379> so<00:05:06.529> smooth

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
to turn the only thing is it's so smooth

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.559 
to turn the only thing is it's so smooth
like<00:05:07.129> all<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.520> layers<00:05:07.759> are<00:05:07.939> turning<00:05:08.240> at<00:05:08.330> once

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
like all the layers are turning at once

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.510 
like all the layers are turning at once
so<00:05:08.779> it's<00:05:08.900> hard<00:05:09.139> to<00:05:09.199> keep<00:05:09.379> it<00:05:09.529> all<00:05:09.590> aligned<00:05:10.009> but

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
so it's hard to keep it all aligned but

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.149 
so it's hard to keep it all aligned but
it's<00:05:11.240> probably<00:05:11.479> only<00:05:11.750> because<00:05:12.050> it's<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.680> new

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
it's probably only because it's a new

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.249 
it's probably only because it's a new
shape<00:05:13.610> for<00:05:13.909> me<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:14.210> if<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.419> keep<00:05:14.629> practicing<00:05:14.750> it

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
shape for me so if I keep practicing it

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:16.209 
shape for me so if I keep practicing it
I'll<00:05:15.349> probably<00:05:15.529> get<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.860> hang<00:05:16.009> of<00:05:16.129> it

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
I'll probably get the hang of it

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.629 
I'll probably get the hang of it
probably<00:05:16.729> make<00:05:16.969> a<00:05:17.060> small<00:05:17.270> video<00:05:17.419> this<00:05:17.719> soon<00:05:18.020> so

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
probably make a small video this soon so

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.980 
probably make a small video this soon so
yeah<00:05:19.639> that's<00:05:19.819> it<00:05:19.969> thanks<00:05:20.330> for<00:05:20.449> watching<00:05:20.810> and

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
yeah that's it thanks for watching and

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.889 
yeah that's it thanks for watching and
I'll<00:05:21.139> see<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.409> in<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.529> next<00:05:21.740> one
