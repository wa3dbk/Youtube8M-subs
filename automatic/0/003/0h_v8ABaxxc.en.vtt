00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:07.229 
hi and welcome to on Kiyo's new Android

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.650 
hi and welcome to on Kiyo's new Android
app<00:00:07.410> I'll<00:00:08.370> be<00:00:08.670> running<00:00:08.970> through<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> lot<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
app I'll be running through a lot of the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.350 
app I'll be running through a lot of the
features<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.130> app<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.429> how<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:12.179> can

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
features of the app and how you can

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.169 
features of the app and how you can
actually<00:00:12.509> control<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.139> non-key<00:00:13.589> AVR<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.969> here

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
actually control a non-key AVR so here

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.870 
actually control a non-key AVR so here
it<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.360> foreign<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.550> instantly<00:00:17.550> you'll

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it is foreign up and instantly you'll

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.599 
it is foreign up and instantly you'll
actually<00:00:18.030> find<00:00:18.600> your<00:00:19.200> particular<00:00:19.500> AVR<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
actually find your particular AVR on the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.120 
actually find your particular AVR on the
network<00:00:21.109> you<00:00:22.109> select<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.890> will<00:00:22.980> drop

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
network you select it and it will drop

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.519 
network you select it and it will drop
straight<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> main<00:00:23.820> screen<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:25.380> main

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
straight to the main screen the main

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.400 
straight to the main screen the main
screen<00:00:25.859> shows<00:00:26.339> you<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> power<00:00:27.509> status<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
screen shows you the power status the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.089 
screen shows you the power status the
input<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.669> DSPs<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> volume

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
input the DSPs and also have the volume

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.630 
input the DSPs and also have the volume
and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.000> Android<00:00:33.450> icon<00:00:34.250> selecting<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.310> input

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and the Android icon selecting the input

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
and the Android icon selecting the input
allows<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> scroll<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.289> down<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
allows you to scroll up and down to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.000 
allows you to scroll up and down to
actually<00:00:38.640> change<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> input<00:00:39.739> here<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.860> go

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
actually change the input here we go

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.150 
actually change the input here we go
surround<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> bd/dvd<00:00:42.800> or<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.949> can<00:00:44.070> select

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
surround to bd/dvd or we can select

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
surround to bd/dvd or we can select
another<00:00:44.460> input<00:00:45.890> net<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.879> obviously<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
another input net and obviously the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
another input net and obviously the
changes<00:00:49.079> made<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.190> mirrored

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
changes made here will be mirrored

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.630 
changes made here will be mirrored
actually<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.690> AV<00:00:51.960> receiver<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> pressing

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
actually on the AV receiver so pressing

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
actually on the AV receiver so pressing
the<00:00:53.820> net<00:00:53.940> button<00:00:54.300> takes<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> network

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the net button takes you to network

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.310 
the net button takes you to network

just press last.fm i'll actually go and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.700 
just press last.fm i'll actually go and
grab<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.100> information<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> AVR<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
grab the information from the AVR and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.600 
grab the information from the AVR and
the<00:01:04.710> first<00:01:04.920> thing<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.190> do<00:01:05.340> is<00:01:05.460> sign

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the first thing you have to do is sign

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
the first thing you have to do is sign
into<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.910> account<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.480> your<00:01:06.990> enter<00:01:07.230> username

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.940 
the V tuner works exactly the same way
the<00:01:19.829> v2<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.549> actually<00:01:21.030> inside<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> AVR<00:01:21.960> you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the v2 now actually inside the AVR you

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.850 
the v2 now actually inside the AVR you
select<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.369> country<00:01:24.140> particular<00:01:25.140> station

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.260 

when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.890> find<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> radio<00:01:29.549> station<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
when you find the radio station that you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.430 
when you find the radio station that you
want

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440
