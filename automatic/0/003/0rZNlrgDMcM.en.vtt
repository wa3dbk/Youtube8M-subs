00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.730 

today<00:00:02.820> we're<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.270> look<00:00:03.510> at<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.319> visual

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
today we're going to look at the visual

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.710 
today we're going to look at the visual
programming<00:00:05.040> language<00:00:05.640> which<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.420> one<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.600> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
programming language which is one of the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.830 
programming language which is one of the
components<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.410> robotics<00:00:07.859> developer<00:00:08.340> studio

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
components of robotics developer studio

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.480 
components of robotics developer studio
so<00:00:09.840> we'll<00:00:09.990> work<00:00:10.170> through<00:00:10.530> just<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.070> quick

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
so we'll work through just a quick

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
so we'll work through just a quick
example<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.780> allows<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.440> control<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
example that allows you to control the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.930 
example that allows you to control the
robot<00:00:14.009> using<00:00:14.759> an<00:00:14.969> Xbox<00:00:15.360> controller<00:00:16.789> this<00:00:17.789> is

robot using an Xbox controller this is

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.029 
robot using an Xbox controller this is
vpl<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.660> see<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> number<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
vpl as you see here it's got a number of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
vpl as you see here it's got a number of
different<00:00:20.160> panels<00:00:20.699> there's<00:00:21.119> some<00:00:21.330> basic

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different panels there's some basic

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.870 
different panels there's some basic
built<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.260> activities<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.699> up

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
as part of a vpl program up in the top
right<00:00:46.140> we've<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.379> project<00:00:47.100> window<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> then

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
right we've got project window and then

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.170 
right we've got project window and then
a<00:00:48.690> properties<00:00:49.110> window<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:50.460> start<00:00:50.700> by

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
a properties window so let's start by

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.569 
a properties window so let's start by
grabbing<00:00:52.079> hold<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.680> an<00:00:52.949> Xbox<00:00:53.489> controller

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
grabbing hold of an Xbox controller

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
grabbing hold of an Xbox controller
service<00:00:54.710> will<00:00:55.710> drag<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:56.840> drop<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> on

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
service will drag that over drop it on

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
service will drag that over drop it on
to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> design<00:00:58.739> surface<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> you'll

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
to the design surface here and you'll

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
to the design surface here and you'll
notice<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.140> got<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> couple<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.980> little

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
notice that it's got a couple of little

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
notice that it's got a couple of little
things<00:01:02.489> sticking<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> side<00:01:03.650> depend<00:01:04.650> on

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
things sticking out the side depend on

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.190 
things sticking out the side depend on
the<00:01:04.890> left<00:01:05.129> pointing<00:01:05.610> into<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.750> controller

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the left pointing into the controller

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.250 
the left pointing into the controller
block<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.490> input<00:01:08.790> pin<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
block is an input pin on the right the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920 
block is an input pin on the right the
arrow<00:01:10.470> pointing<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.729> output<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
arrow pointing out is an output and the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.560 
arrow pointing out is an output and the
round<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.890> call<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> notification

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
round one is what we call a notification

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
round one is what we call a notification
which<00:01:15.570> means<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.049> messages<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.920> pop<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
which means that messages can pop out of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
which means that messages can pop out of
here<00:01:18.049> asynchronously<00:01:19.049> whenever<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
here asynchronously whenever the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.140 
here asynchronously whenever the
controller<00:01:20.040> has<00:01:20.220> something<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> tell<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
controller has something to tell you it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.940 
controller has something to tell you it
just<00:01:21.180> fires<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> message<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.619> need

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
just fires out a message you don't need

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.179 
just fires out a message you don't need
to<00:01:23.220> send<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.640> input<00:01:23.939> message<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:25.009> I'll<00:01:26.009> go

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to send an input message to it I'll go

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
to send an input message to it I'll go
and<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.700> calculate<00:01:27.479> box<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and get a calculate box from the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
and get a calculate box from the
built-in<00:01:28.590> activities<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.329> here

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
built-in activities put that over here

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.789 
built-in activities put that over here
and<00:01:31.220> then<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.909> take<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> notification<00:01:33.799> put

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and then I can take a notification put

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
and then I can take a notification put
it<00:01:34.890> into<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> calculate<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.390> shows<00:01:36.600> me

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it into the calculate and it shows me

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
it into the calculate and it shows me
all<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> available<00:01:37.920> message<00:01:38.700> types<00:01:39.030> that

done that I need to put in an expression
in<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> calculation<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.439> i'll<00:02:01.799> put

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
in here for the calculation so i'll put

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.020 
in here for the calculation so i'll put
left<00:02:03.990> x

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:19.120 

Plus<00:02:11.560> left<00:02:12.560> y<00:02:14.980> divided<00:02:15.980> by<00:02:16.069> two<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.830> do<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
Plus left y divided by two I can do the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.870 
Plus left y divided by two I can do the
same<00:02:19.370> thing<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.920> left<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.190> right<00:02:22.250> motors

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
same thing for the left and right motors

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.900 
same thing for the left and right motors
on<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.420> robot<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.020> then<00:02:24.950> need<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.550> combine

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
on the robot I then need to combine

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.570 
on the robot I then need to combine
those<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.319> need<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> send<00:02:27.920> them<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
those and I need to send them to the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.520 
those and I need to send them to the
robot<00:02:28.730> itself<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.959> can<00:02:30.020> control<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
robot itself so that I can control the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.610 
robot itself so that I can control the
drive<00:02:30.770> for<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:31.489> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.910> grab<00:02:32.060> a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
drive for that I'm going to grab a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.860 
drive for that I'm going to grab a
generic<00:02:33.620> differential<00:02:34.280> drive<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:35.510> reason

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
generic differential drive the reason

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.840 
generic differential drive the reason
for<00:02:36.080> using<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.650> generic<00:02:36.770> differential<00:02:37.580> drive

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
for using the generic differential drive

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.449 
for using the generic differential drive
is<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:39.350> set<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.769> up<00:02:39.830> using<00:02:40.310> a

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
is that I can set this up using a

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.030 
is that I can set this up using a
configuration<00:02:41.180> file<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.200> i<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.620> use<00:02:42.769> a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
configuration file so that i can use a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.720 
configuration file so that i can use a
variety<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.610> different<00:02:43.820> robots<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.720> i<00:02:45.730> only

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
variety of different robots and i only

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.670 
variety of different robots and i only
need<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.269> talk<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:48.050> this<00:02:48.320> generic

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
need to talk to this generic

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.610 
need to talk to this generic

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
of the services that I've requested I

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.509 
of the services that I've requested I
get<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.880> flexible<00:03:56.390> dialogue<00:03:56.930> here<00:03:57.519> which

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
get this flexible dialogue here which

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.220 
get this flexible dialogue here which
shows<00:03:58.760> me<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.030> power<00:03:59.239> levels<00:03:59.720> currently

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
shows me the power levels currently

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.080 
shows me the power levels currently
there<00:04:00.410> 0<00:04:00.650> because<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.100> robots<00:04:01.250> not<00:04:01.579> moving

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
there 0 because the robots not moving

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.509 
there 0 because the robots not moving
then<00:04:02.959> I've<00:04:03.109> got<00:04:03.140> my<00:04:03.560> joystick<00:04:03.859> controller

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
then I've got my joystick controller

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.860 
then I've got my joystick controller
that<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.870> push<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.920> left<00:04:07.790> thumbstick<00:04:08.450> and

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
that I can push the left thumbstick and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.360 
that I can push the left thumbstick and
I<00:04:09.530> can<00:04:09.709> drive<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.280> robot<00:04:10.459> around<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.810> do<00:04:12.049> so

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
I can drive the robot around as I do so

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.759 
I can drive the robot around as I do so
you<00:04:13.370> will<00:04:13.400> notice<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.600> values<00:04:15.199> in<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
you will notice that the values in the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.099 
you will notice that the values in the
power<00:04:15.980> levels<00:04:16.459> are<00:04:16.870> also<00:04:17.870> changing

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
power levels are also changing

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.890 
power levels are also changing
so<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.889> differential<00:04:20.489> drive<00:04:20.699> robot<00:04:21.180> full

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
so with a differential drive robot full

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.110 
so with a differential drive robot full
power<00:04:22.250> setting<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.520> left<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.060> right

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
power setting the left and the right

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.110 
power setting the left and the right
both<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.110> drives<00:04:25.710> forward<00:04:26.009> setting<00:04:27.000> them

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
both to one drives forward setting them

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.700 
both to one drives forward setting them
both<00:04:27.270> negative<00:04:27.569> drives<00:04:27.990> backwards<00:04:28.500> and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
both negative drives backwards and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.920 
both negative drives backwards and
setting<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.520> opposite<00:04:29.909> values<00:04:30.270> spins<00:04:30.810> around

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
setting the opposite values spins around

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.830
