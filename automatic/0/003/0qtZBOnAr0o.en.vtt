supposed to appear in the first episode

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.670 
supposed to appear in the first episode
because<00:03:26.879> rhyme<00:03:27.690> style<00:03:27.959> said<00:03:28.169> that<00:03:28.319> he<00:03:28.440> saw

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
because rhyme style said that he saw

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.939 
because rhyme style said that he saw
that<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.669> teaser<00:03:30.120> trailer<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.500> supposed<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
that the teaser trailer is supposed to

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.830 
that the teaser trailer is supposed to
take<00:03:32.099> place<00:03:32.129> all<00:03:32.669> in<00:03:32.909> episode<00:03:33.209> 1<00:03:33.419> but<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.690> just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
take place all in episode 1 but it just

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.689 
take place all in episode 1 but it just
seems<00:03:34.019> weird<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.379> me<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.799> don't<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.250> don't<00:03:35.280> think

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
seems weird to me I don't I don't think

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.970 
seems weird to me I don't I don't think
that<00:03:35.930> there<00:03:36.930> would<00:03:37.079> be<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.500> big<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.829> plot

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
that there would be that big of a plot

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.610 
that there would be that big of a plot
hole<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:39.030> don't<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.569> but<00:03:39.599> Tori<00:03:40.290> hum<00:03:40.500> is

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
hole in it I don't know but Tori hum is

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.469 
hole in it I don't know but Tori hum is
not<00:03:40.859> exactly<00:03:41.250> famous<00:03:41.519> for<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:43.019> know<00:03:44.269> spot<00:03:45.269> on

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.240 
not exactly famous for you know spot on
timelines<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.500> always<00:03:46.650> fit<00:03:46.979> well<00:03:47.129> together

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
timelines that always fit well together
