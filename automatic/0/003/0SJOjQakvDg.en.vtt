00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 Hello, dear friends, last time 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.620
 there was no movie but he has neither 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.900
 strange for some reason I already have it somewhere 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 heard and talked somewhere today call 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.189
 accepted discharged I perform throw in 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.189
 discussion group vkontakte begin 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.590
 first call and that is baby food 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.230
 I would think that it is generally easy but 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.149
 baby food we have with broccoli in not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.130
 specially written not to take any 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.590
 sweet type of carrot take some there 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.590
 either with meat or broccoli here I took 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 throw it out like you know 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 don't know dodge the soup i love the slots 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.320
 I don't know the street I don't remember that I 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.770
 I tried marriage or probably in soup if 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.469
 just in what let's try 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.600
 here I have had to buy spoons 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.840
 10 pieces okay zdelali 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.470
 in the old way there is one spoon 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.470
 shoot as I open 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:21.050
 you know what it smells like in the ring 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 the channel there in the cottages approximate algae 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.240
 or leeches here it is now this 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.820
 It smells like there's something I need so 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.750
 probably if I can't eat everything 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.290
 I probably eat well, they are small spoons 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.860
 56 scoops well, we start the first one shorter 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.860
 impression 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 it often resembles corn with peas 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:01.860
 protaschu which creates and you think it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:05.550
 useful at least often but let you not 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.100
 I know if everything or not, but still 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.540
 let's go eat i had 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.540
 honest with the delivery I am not to the feeling of a piece 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.620
 but I backwater as what types of 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.980
 Now they should take it there I swallowed 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:49.940
 the name is qualitative and so we go to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.750
 second call and the second call is very 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.450
 so cool 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.870
 we need an empty hand empty hand 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.290
 and a box of matches it was super cool 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.410
 focus we need a mouth to put out a match i 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:10.660
 never did i always point the shaft 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.660
 Well, let's try the file a little 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.730
 And this of course was not considered me like this 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.040
 here do so windless 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.040
 this is where the wind is the wind from where cmyk 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.180
 this or it has gone out the army it's gone out 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.080
 earlier the operator says it goes out 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.080
 earlier good 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.780
 sulfur in the mouth so let's try two 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.780
 matches 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:11.730
 it's very pretty hard those guys 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:14.430
 3 matches and all about business is shorter for me 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.750
 Now here is overwhelmed by algae 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.750
 There is for this I here it is 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.910
 no friends and will no longer do it 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.770
 because now i'm a little real 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.270
 burned tongue 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.990
 still I was asked one match I 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.240
 made three 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:43.260
 I have some smack in my mouth 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.260
 incomprehensible here this gray here and we go 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 the third call needs to be shorter it will 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.870
 cool for you because if you do it 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.700
 make you get a gift of me 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.780
 VKontakte is probably cool in general 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.350
 the essence of the call is that the order language 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.780
 Teeth tongue press and sing 5 songs 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.950
 and you have to guess these in the comments 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.920
 songs who first guesses like that 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.730
 will get a gift so let's get started 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:30.600
 I did not come up with a song but let's start like this 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:33.180
 first but hopefully just a little bit clear 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.400
 second song 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.390
 Now I come up with right now and come up with Marsh 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.390
 here we come 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.460
 I hope to go it is clear well, I ask 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:54.759
 here it is if that fret hint is Russian 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.759
 a song and another song here is also russian 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:10.099
 and so 4 song let's all of a sudden then 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.379
 Russian does not know and does not listen and 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:22.699
 rather that the sensational pack of prepositions 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:25.550
 pack what a pack song and everything seems and 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.529
 last song 5 i will do this to 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.679
 Here it was really hard to think now 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:32.659
 more and the last song will not 

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:37.389
 speak speak Russian to Spanish 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.389
 german english just gonna sing 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:46.130
 a mass of law to the depth 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:50.340
 cold discharge were small passages and 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:54.960
 yes now with you write in the comments and 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.180
 if you guess you get a voice all 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.710
 it's time to say goodbye i want to say 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.570
 so that you throw the discussion vkontaktika 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.220
