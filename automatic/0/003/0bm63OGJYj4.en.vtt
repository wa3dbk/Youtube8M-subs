to be doing foiling like you see right
over<00:00:25.380> here

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
over here

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
over here
now<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.369> want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> use<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.210> brushes<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
now you want to use some brushes that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
now you want to use some brushes that
are<00:00:28.289> very<00:00:28.590> thin<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.400> thinner<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> better<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
are very thin the thinner the better and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.690 
are very thin the thinner the better and
make<00:00:31.140> sure<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.340> good

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
make sure it's not one of your good

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240 
make sure it's not one of your good
brushes<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.510> after<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> glue

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
brushes because after all this is glue

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.360 
brushes because after all this is glue
and<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:36.630> mean<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.170> come<00:00:37.410> out<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.920> still

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and I mean it does come out but still

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
and I mean it does come out but still
and<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.270> also<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> tile<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and you also want to have a tile or a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
and you also want to have a tile or a
piece<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> paper<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.570> put<00:00:42.899> your

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
piece of paper that you can put your

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650 
piece of paper that you can put your
glue<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.910> now<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> tell<00:00:45.570> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
glue on now I'm going to tell you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.850 
glue on now I'm going to tell you
something<00:00:45.899> about<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.680> glue<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:48.059> glue<00:00:48.420> is

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
something about this glue this glue is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.090 
something about this glue this glue is
pretty<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.340> foiling<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:51.860> when<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
pretty good for foiling because when you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
pretty good for foiling because when you
put<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.390> tile<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.800> piece<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
put it out on your tile or your piece of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.020 
put it out on your tile or your piece of
paper<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.570> gray<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.640> when<00:00:59.640> you're

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
paper it will be gray and when you're

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.290 
paper it will be gray and when you're
drawing<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.649> gray<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.640> then

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
drawing with it it will be gray and then

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
drawing with it it will be gray and then
when<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> dries<00:01:04.379> completely<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.280> turns<00:01:05.580> black

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
when it dries completely it turns black

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
when it dries completely it turns black
so<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> good<00:01:07.619> indicator<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so that is a good indicator that it is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.350 
so that is a good indicator that it is
ready<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.780> foil<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.670> doing<00:01:12.180> your

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
ready to foil when you're doing your

nail<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> make<00:01:13.799> sure<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.610> if

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
nail you want to make sure that if

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the shine off of the nail because this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
the shine off of the nail because this
is<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> rubber

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is like a it's kind of like a rubber

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.429 
is like a it's kind of like a rubber
cement<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.520> way<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:30.119> it'll<00:01:30.720> kind<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
cement in a way you know it'll kind of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.890 
cement in a way you know it'll kind of
peel<00:01:31.770> off<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.270> careful<00:01:33.750> when

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
peel off if you don't be careful when

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
peel off if you don't be careful when
you're<00:01:34.020> pressing<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.500> foil<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.640> it's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you're pressing the foil on it so it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.819 
you're pressing the foil on it so it's
probably<00:01:36.060> best<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:38.180> matte

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
probably best for you to have a matte

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
probably best for you to have a matte
surface<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> prepare<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> foil

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
surface I'm going to prepare the foil

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.499 
surface I'm going to prepare the foil
and<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.159> spray<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> foil<00:01:44.909> with

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and what I do is I spray the foil with

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.160 
and what I do is I spray the foil with
rubbing<00:01:46.049> alcohol<00:01:46.229> isopropyl<00:01:47.009> alcohol<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.420> take

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol I take

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol I take
a<00:01:49.200> wipe<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.549> wipe<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.630> foil<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.909> kind<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
a wipe and I wipe the foil I kind of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.810 
a wipe and I wipe the foil I kind of
clean<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.680> what<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> does<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
clean that back and what that does is it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
clean that back and what that does is it
helps<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> foil<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.710> release

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
helps so that the foil will release

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
helps so that the foil will release
itself<00:01:59.670> easily<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.560> some

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
itself easily I'm just going to do some

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:33.740 
itself easily I'm just going to do some
random<00:02:02.070> drawings<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.570> thumbnail

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.380 

now<00:02:34.500> every<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:34.980> often<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.460> may<00:02:35.640> want<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> wipe

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
now every so often you may want to wipe

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.140 
now every so often you may want to wipe
your<00:02:36.600> brush<00:02:36.840> off<00:02:37.140> because<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:38.370> gets<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.940> little

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
your brush off because it gets a little

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.050 
your brush off because it gets a little
bit<00:02:39.450> clumpy<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.590> that's<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.790> glue

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
bit clumpy and that's because the glue

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.440 
bit clumpy and that's because the glue
is<00:02:42.120> starting<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.780> dry<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.540> keep<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.070> wipe

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450

it looks like

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.270 
it looks like
it's<00:03:32.230> gray<00:03:34.440> when<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.560> take<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:35.950> out<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.270 
bottle and you start drawing it's like a
medium<00:03:39.700> gray<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.709> then<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.830> dries<00:03:42.069> completely

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
medium gray and then it dries completely

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.120 
medium gray and then it dries completely
black<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.269> that's<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.319> good<00:03:44.500> indicator<00:03:45.010> that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
black and that's a good indicator that
