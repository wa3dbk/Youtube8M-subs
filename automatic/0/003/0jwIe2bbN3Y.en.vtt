00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.370
 yes it's her time for a new video 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.140
 and in this video you want to show you how such an effect in the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.370
 War the 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.729
 Color in black and white picture effect 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.479
 or Video Effect 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:15.379
 or as ten quoted fencing stress reform Arthur which is under it 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.379
 can not imagine anything 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.849
 Dr 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.849
 Chur is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 No 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.120
 Euro 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.340
 about losing that today show how to do that then the effect as well 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.930
 in gets 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.630
 Well then, first of all, I can take a video file that is the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 inside that 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.430
 the nature video from the example video from Windows 7 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.840
 well so kid renounce i want new compositions with which i like them too 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.500
 read or conditions 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.050
 which 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.050
 and Ute goal that with controls d 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 in that case, about now, women want to have that 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 the combo or the same way too 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.390
 then the top level we hide and Gayer our lowest level 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.119
 and then was "Kind of the Vq return voyage and 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.700
 Primary residence the good ones 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.040
 the six young founders all the way down to minus 8 percent 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 if the top level is on and yet off at the same time 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.710
 but it's all a Farber again we do not want to expire 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.820
 Effect v Correction 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.580
 and Forbo usual leaves Faber 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.970
 against excludes this little pipette 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 and if we care about Tom and Brown 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.680
 the balance seemed to be on again 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.580
 one hundred percent 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.760
 and 3 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.720
 but also already 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.130
 on demands 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 and after that it's better that they get to 1 so better 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.059
 you would have to stand around 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.769
 Tolerance you can also Virgin Rail 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.930
 I usually always have that on 15 to 20 percent 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.779
 15 30 is enough 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.029
 Well 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.029
 Koopmann and do that 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.739
 mam 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.059
 the twelve if women 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.609
 Here is these birds then 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.609
 We want to see that we are also black and white 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.319
 rough Emerson's end of our cheapened 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.129
 Report against us 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.519
 Paroubek let make a stopwatch at the tolerance 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:03.339
 go a few farther with control and the case box 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.590
 for a new key for reminders indoors saturation approximately at 0 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.590
 percent 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.439
 a yes so now 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.269
 another video 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.089
 young fair 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.769
 so get hold of perfume 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.429
 say again 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.189
 Ramesh always play around a few crop failures and 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.369
 there we want to lead a long green now no 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.719
 it's called that 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.139
 but in Kiel flutes 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.369
 you continue 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.279
 and who quite objections 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:14.989
 that's how you do it 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.989
 I bet forced out of edges 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.960
 and 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 until then 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.199
 so that's still playing 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
 so about a dozen then look like 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.039
 Dr 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.039
 yes the resolution will of course be a bit 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.229
 Being placed under something to make it a little faster usually makes it a bit higher and higher 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.800
 you can still with the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 Crayon tool work as in next to Photoshop 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.179
 through BÃ¼low these areas go out for Tim Brown 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.379
 the holidays were affected in I-form 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.129
 or so 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.360
 depending on your taste and I hope that percent of this video pleased you 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.129
 now ready now 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.129
 and if yes, give it a thumbs up 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.639
 and also uncommon and 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.330
 Until next time
