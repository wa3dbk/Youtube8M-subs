00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.220 
an angle and then I layered it on top of
that<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.230> then<00:02:40.300> using<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:42.280> linen<00:02:43.280> tread<00:02:44.230> just

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that and then using the linen tread just

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.110 
that and then using the linen tread just
put<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.590> here<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:48.640> I'll<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:50.000> tie<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.300> like

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
put it here and I'll just tie it like

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:06.900 
put it here and I'll just tie it like
this<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.230> twice<00:03:04.540> then<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:06.110> another

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
this and do it twice then on another

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.630 
this and do it twice then on another
vanilla<00:03:07.910> piece<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.600> cardstock<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.430> stamp<00:03:10.430> that

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
vanilla piece of cardstock I stamp that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.860 
vanilla piece of cardstock I stamp that
one<00:03:11.180> tree<00:03:11.660> using<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.770> early<00:03:13.070> espresso<00:03:13.310> ink
