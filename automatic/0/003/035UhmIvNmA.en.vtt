over<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> year<00:00:30.029> i<00:00:30.060> think<00:00:30.240> before<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.869> actually

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
over a year i think before we actually

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.950 
over a year i think before we actually
made<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.610> in<00:00:32.610> 18<00:00:32.910> months<00:00:33.210> i<00:00:33.510> had<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> first

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
made it in 18 months i had the first

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.990 
made it in 18 months i had the first
time<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.469> script<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.920> i<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.460> board<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.940> i

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
time the script and i was on board so i

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.190 
time the script and i was on board so i
could<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> long<00:00:36.870> time

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
could think about for a long time

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.940 
could think about for a long time
usually<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.370> TV<00:00:39.350> especially<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.620> company
