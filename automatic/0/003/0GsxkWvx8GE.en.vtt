by<00:00:38.910> taking<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.300> hands<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
by taking my hands and I'm just going to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
by taking my hands and I'm just going to
press<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> skin<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
press it all over the skin because I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.610 
press it all over the skin because I
find<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> heat<00:00:42.719> make<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> BB<00:00:43.440> cream

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
find that the heat make the BB cream

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.709 
find that the heat make the BB cream
melts<00:00:44.010> into<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> skin<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> bit<00:00:44.820> better<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
melts into the skin a bit better and it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.260 
melts into the skin a bit better and it
makes<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.020> look<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.710> natural<00:00:47.270> for

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
makes it look so much more natural for
