00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everybody today I'll show you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.690
 A very easy recipe I make 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.910
 always in my house who accompanies me 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 on social networks probably came 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 showing much photo of shaikh and a tea 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.429
 Indian 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.070
 I've always done this way I have 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.350
 taken even more because I 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 I discovered that black tea and cinnamon 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 bring many health benefits 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.500
 So today I'm going to teach you the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.800
 my version of xai is such a version 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 half- rated maybe but it takes several 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.040
 ingredients that the chai really takes 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 so I think it 's a very tip 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 valid now with this little cold that is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.550
 making a little chocolate change 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 or latte for a shake that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.030
 chandÃ­a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.950
 You'll need black tea, I like. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 to use this brand here because this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.170
 here I can mix straight into the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.969
 milk 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 but if you have an ordinary black tea in the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.140
 your home you can also use it because I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 I also did with black tea as 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.250
 also work out and it comes so there 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 things individual packages per sign 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.719
 It's my last I have to buy more 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 but of course choose a brand that you 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 want the brand that you are in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 your house 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 another ingredient that we will 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 I need milk, I do not drink milk. 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.299
 integral for many years so I go 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.470
 use skim milk but if you like 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.270
 of whole milk 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.650
 You can use whole milk to people. 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.780
 you will also need a little bit of 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.490
 nutmeg I was in the market today 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.020
 municipality of curitiba to buy the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.909
 ingredients to show well 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 right on the recipe but you can also 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
 use the one that missed the usual time 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.759
 here the use will also need cinnamon 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 will need a little bit of each 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 I'm dying this is not so easy anymore. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.990
 to find but if you do not have 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 Cardamom does not need because it is also 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.530
 So cool and finally we will use 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.600
 a little clove 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.850
 You can use both my normal car 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.979
 which is what I usually use or else you 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.979
 can use the powdered carnation was not much 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.960
 Expensive and this is very 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.350
 because we use very little of each 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.939
 one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.829
 if you want to dance you can dance 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.540
 with a little bit of common sugar or 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.579
 then a little bit of condensed milk 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.469
 so now I'm going to the kitchen to 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.180
 show you how to prepare my 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.180
 time as easily as possible 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.870
 I'm going to wear this chicane here is a 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.180
 cup that you can see is a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:21.360
 a little bit and I'm going to put a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.340
 a little milk and now I'll leave it at 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.960
 microwaves until those hot it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.010
 it takes about two minutes 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.010
 now that my milk is already all right 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.250
 Toasty I use to put my 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.250
 floor 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.190
 I advise you to use 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.620
 now a little spoon, little one 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.080
 So you do not put anything on 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.660
 in great quantity because everything here 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.580
 It tastes very strong so you have 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.500
 I put a little of each thing I 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.500
 I'll put half a spoonful of cinnamon 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.560
 I'll also put half a spoonful of 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 clove 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.500
 I'm going to put a third of this walnut woman 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:17.200
 and I will put a third of this 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.300
 take care of coffee of each love alone 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.580
 Now just mix everything up with you. 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.680
 try and see if you think you need 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.150
 plus some ingredient if you think 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.800
 we need added 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.650
 otherwise you can stop by here it's okay 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.990
 It's very delicious, how I want to give 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.030
 idea for you to do one more thing 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.050
 chubby I picked up here a little bit 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.580
 condensed milk 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.600
 so I'll come here with my 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.600
 coffee spoon 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.640
 it is totally optional and it has not been 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.060
 included and an original recipe of 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.060
 charles and diana 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.090
 very good with condensed milk and only 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.670
 I had bought a packaging house. 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.829
 and I paid well about 1 and 30 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.170
 but you can easily reused 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.129
 in a pot that you already have in your 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.959
 House 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.510
 I'll put the soup dip of 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.269
 cinnamon powder half a tablespoon 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.970
 clove powder one third of a tablespoon 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.759
 nutmeg soup and a third of this 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.620
 tablespoon of every good now I go 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:23.060
 continue to fill the pot until 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.060
 He got here at the beginning. 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.190
 now just mix everything in here 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.500
 our mix for chen is no longer 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.500
 ready 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.060

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.069
