00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.010
 just two days and then the time has come for the champion match between ajax and 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.700
 Twente Friday morning 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 That is why many journalists were busy with the future 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.760
 even more than usual for the road to the complex they saw the players 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.960
 close relaxed training and just like with the leterme fans in mind with the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.530
 players I have you so an hour the church goes without saying that points 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.280
 extremely important competitions is as roma sunday 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.439
 we watch 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.400
 yes huge to hell man important master this competition on program but 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.550
 be there people who had to win 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.970
 Nijkerk is really looking forward to it 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.880
 and with a bit like all supporters and it has been like this all week long 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.800
 I want about half past two on Sunday but that will be another five 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.450
 know at least have that scale or not 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.739
 yes that the brands of course everyone has for these competitions 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.470
 every lot a program is about is this competition 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.510
 I think I am really looking forward to a hope that I would like the man to be five years old 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.550
 in scale in our country 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.190
 be a highlight in my career 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.320
 Remarkably, the selection turned out to be very relaxed during the training 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.299
 of some pressure 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.950
 was no question either 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 the supplier translated 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.259
 no i am not nervous healthy stress it will name 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.170
 three children 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.710
 yes I am really looking forward to it and there will always be pressure in the arena now 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.140
 probably even more 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.510
 which is that we can meet the ranks 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.940
 nicolai boilesen also relaxed about today in the opening phase of the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.350
 cup final when he played the ball a number of times and seemed to be bothered by it 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.510
 nerves 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.310
 this is my first big big competitions of course 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.119
 still a little getting used to the pace a so called the pace 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.830
 Sunday got worse but yes and now I know how first in that he is without points 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.700
 they do not become the experience of the cup final the municipality the upcoming 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.120
 Sunday also sees Frank the farmer 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.380
 in the case of young players 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.460
 the boruses is one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.670
 I may not have played such an important game at all 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.510
 the outgoing government for the shooting 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.570
 that of course for their new might come out well among the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 turkish plays 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 won the most important game of the season 2 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.990
 a more experienced one 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.279
 refresh the club 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.279
 the fnv germ 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.149
 these youth players 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.989
 We now know what it's like to go to a destination and you so I think it's one 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.940
 another advantage is that they 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.480
 it's played a better one and you should try ahead 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.799
 but the players can also get an advantage on Sunday is the massive support of 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:31.570
 the fans 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.570
 at the cup final, the ajax audience was a good cause 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.079
 which hopefully have a hurricane of sound quite powerful 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.549
 he has a german man 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.339
 he was crazy like a madman standing behind us shouting our country victory in it 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.629
 the same but players need a little opening
