00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
routine alright so let's talk about the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.780 
routine alright so let's talk about the
chest<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.590> anatomy<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.580> pretty

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
chest and the anatomy of it it's pretty

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.840 
chest and the anatomy of it it's pretty
basic<00:00:14.969> right<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.020> PEC<00:00:16.560> minor<00:00:17.279> major

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
basic right we have the PEC minor major

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
basic right we have the PEC minor major
which<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.300> pretty<00:00:18.720> much<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.560> whole<00:00:19.770> PEC<00:00:20.130> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
which is pretty much the whole PEC and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
which is pretty much the whole PEC and
then<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.180> upper<00:00:21.900> clavicular<00:00:22.199> or<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
then we got the upper clavicular or the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.849 
then we got the upper clavicular or the
upper<00:00:23.490> chest<00:00:23.730> okay<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.170> functions<00:00:25.650> are

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
upper chest okay and the functions are

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.150 
upper chest okay and the functions are
pretty<00:00:26.160> basic<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.880> upper<00:00:27.269> chest<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.890> going<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
pretty basic the upper chest is going to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.209 
pretty basic the upper chest is going to
flex<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> shoulder<00:00:30.210> while<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.439> PEC<00:00:31.890> minor

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
flex the shoulder while the PEC minor

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.120 
flex the shoulder while the PEC minor
major<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.690> extend<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.680> shoulder

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
major is going to extend the shoulder

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
major is going to extend the shoulder
and<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:35.700> together<00:00:35.910> they're<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and then all together they're going to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
and then all together they're going to
bring<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> humerus<00:00:37.980> across<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.120> body<00:00:39.360> all

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
bring the humerus across the body all

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
bring the humerus across the body all
right<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> would<00:00:42.390> recommend<00:00:42.540> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
right so what I would recommend you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.619 
right so what I would recommend you
start<00:00:43.200> off<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.520> big<00:00:44.730> heavy<00:00:45.000> compound

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
start off with is a big heavy compound

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.260 
start off with is a big heavy compound
that's<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> target<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.969> PEC

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that's really going to target the PEC

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.720 
that's really going to target the PEC
minor<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.899> major<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.579> obviously<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
minor and major because obviously this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.930 
minor and major because obviously this
is<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.000> larger<00:00:51.510> part<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> PEC<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
is the larger part of the PEC right so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.319 
is the larger part of the PEC right so
an<00:00:54.480> exercise<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.500> use<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.309> either<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
an exercise you can use is either the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
an exercise you can use is either the
flat<00:00:57.719> bench<00:00:58.230> press<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> barbell<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879

flat bench press with a barbell or a
dumbbell<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.289> decline<00:01:01.850> bench<00:01:02.850> press<00:01:03.359> with

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
dumbbell or the decline bench press with

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.770 
dumbbell or the decline bench press with
a<00:01:03.899> barbell<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> dumbbell<00:01:05.010> either<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.510> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

a barbell or a dumbbell either one is
going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.290> work<00:01:07.530> perfectly<00:01:08.159> fine<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.060> loading

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
going to work perfectly fine for loading

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.370 
going to work perfectly fine for loading

maybe alternate between them it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.170 
maybe alternate between them it's

one thing that I do want to mention is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.609 
one thing that I do want to mention is
just<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> sake<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> variety<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.619> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just for the sake of variety if you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.149 
just for the sake of variety if you
start<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.399> first<00:01:54.020> lift<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.860> dumbbell

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
start your first lift with a dumbbell

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.620 
start your first lift with a dumbbell
then<00:01:56.850> perhaps<00:01:57.390> doing<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.939> barbell<00:01:59.939> or<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.329> cable

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
then perhaps doing a barbell or a cable

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.620 
then perhaps doing a barbell or a cable
for<00:02:01.079> your<00:02:01.110> second<00:02:01.619> lift<00:02:01.799> would<00:02:02.520> allow<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
for your second lift would allow the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.020 
for your second lift would allow the
workout<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.320> de<00:02:04.890> seem<00:02:05.130> like

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
workout to de seem like

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.820 
workout to de seem like
more<00:02:06.299> variation<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.140> opposed<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.650> doing

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
more variation as opposed to doing

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.240 
more variation as opposed to doing
barbell<00:02:08.340> barbell<00:02:08.940> etc<00:02:09.600> right<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.100> that's

don't have to go that route but it's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.260 
don't have to go that route but it's
it's<00:02:16.709> pretty<00:02:16.860> much<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.580> when<00:02:18.120> I'm

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
it's pretty much what I do when I'm

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.990 
it's pretty much what I do when I'm
training<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.780> chest<00:02:19.110> okay<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:20.190> lastly

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
training my chest okay and then lastly

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.290

that's<00:02:24.569> going<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> hit<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.260> whole<00:02:25.440> PEC<00:02:25.739> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that's going to hit the whole PEC and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.830 
that's going to hit the whole PEC and
that's<00:02:26.340> why<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.520> always<00:02:26.790> recommend<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.569> you
