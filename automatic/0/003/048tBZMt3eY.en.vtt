00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
signal of the amp or current if you will

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.590 
signal of the amp or current if you will
is<00:03:10.870> fed<00:03:11.290> into<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> coil<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:13.150> will<00:03:13.390> move

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
is fed into the coil it will move

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.220 
is fed into the coil it will move
accordingly<00:03:14.760> doing<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.630> cone<00:03:16.930> or

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
accordingly doing so the cone or

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.910 
accordingly doing so the cone or
diaphragm<00:03:18.040> pushes<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.390> air<00:03:19.510> creating<00:03:20.410> sound

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
diaphragm pushes the air creating sound

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.699 
diaphragm pushes the air creating sound

sorry<00:03:34.560> I'm<00:03:35.560> going<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.190> go<00:03:36.370> through<00:03:36.670> all<00:03:36.820> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
sorry I'm going to go through all the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.979 
sorry I'm going to go through all the
design<00:03:38.019> parameters<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.790> speaker<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.360> see

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
design parameters of a speaker and see

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.289 
design parameters of a speaker and see
how<00:03:41.170> each<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.100> every<00:03:42.370> one<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.519> those<00:03:42.820> can<00:03:43.209> be

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
how each and every one of those can be

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.190 
how each and every one of those can be
tweaked<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:44.380> have<00:03:44.560> different<00:03:44.950> kind<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.310> sounds

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
tweaked to have different kind of sounds

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.850 
tweaked to have different kind of sounds
you<00:03:47.200> know<00:03:47.350> kind<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:48.570> voice<00:03:50.250> coil<00:03:51.570> formal

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
you know kind of voice coil formal

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.229 
you know kind of voice coil formal
material<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.130> then<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.579> material<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.110> or

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
material and then the material of the or

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.870 
material and then the material of the or
the<00:03:58.239> cone<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:59.140> all<00:04:00.130> those<00:04:00.430> things<00:04:00.730> you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
the cone and all those things you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.789 
the cone and all those things you
probably<00:04:01.360> heard<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.630> lot<00:04:01.720> pull<00:04:02.049> sonic<00:04:02.470> cones

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
probably heard a lot pull sonic cones

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.660 
probably heard a lot pull sonic cones
and<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:04.320> they<00:04:05.320> can<00:04:05.470> make<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:06.130> number

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
and and so on they can make it a number

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.300 
and and so on they can make it a number
of<00:04:06.850> different<00:04:07.120> interesting<00:04:07.540> sounds<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:09.070> check

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
of different interesting sounds so check

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.349 
of different interesting sounds so check
out<00:04:09.519> that<00:04:09.549> clip<00:04:09.940> as<00:04:10.090> well<00:04:11.070> alright<00:04:12.329> thanks<00:04:13.329> for
