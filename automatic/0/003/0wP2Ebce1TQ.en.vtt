00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
or a TMC 200 R and a size 18 I would

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.349 
or a TMC 200 R and a size 18 I would
have<00:01:57.909> this<00:01:58.149> fly<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:59.350> know<00:01:59.469> in<00:01:59.710> in<00:02:00.009> 16s<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:00.969> 18

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
have this fly you know in in 16s and 18

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.190 
have this fly you know in in 16s and 18
is<00:02:01.810> pretty<00:02:02.110> pretty<00:02:02.530> much<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.860> common<00:02:03.159> size<00:02:03.369> so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
is pretty pretty much the common size so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.029 
is pretty pretty much the common size so
the<00:02:05.200> first<00:02:05.560> step<00:02:06.009> in<00:02:06.250> tying<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.610> fly<00:02:06.880> is<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
the first step in tying this fly is the

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.509 
the first step in tying this fly is the
tail<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> easiest<00:02:10.149> way<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:12.129> make<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> nice

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
tail in the easiest way to make a nice

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.250 
tail in the easiest way to make a nice
split<00:02:12.849> tail<00:02:15.299> is<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.660> make<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> little<00:02:17.049> ball

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
split tail is to just make a little ball

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.640 
split tail is to just make a little ball
with<00:02:17.470> dummies<00:02:19.049> right<00:02:20.049> on<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> back<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.530 
with dummies right on the back of the
hook<00:02:20.829> that'll<00:02:21.190> keep<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.610> tail<00:02:22.500> split<00:02:23.500> nicely

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
hook that'll keep the tail split nicely

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:36.910 
hook that'll keep the tail split nicely
it<00:02:25.540> doesn't<00:02:25.870> need<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.140> too<00:02:26.380> much

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.520 

once<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.640> get<00:02:37.840> your<00:02:38.840> little<00:02:38.930> ball<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.290> dubbing

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
once you get your little ball of dubbing

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.590 
once you get your little ball of dubbing
on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.740> back<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.100> hook<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:41.210> just<00:02:41.390> cut<00:02:41.570> off

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
on the back of the hook you just cut off

hackle

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.470 

once<00:06:03.530> you<00:06:03.620> get<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:03.830> hackle<00:06:04.190> secured<00:06:04.670> you<00:06:05.450> can

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.540 

once<00:06:25.320> you<00:06:25.410> get<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.620> flag<00:06:25.800> would<00:06:26.010> finish<00:06:28.550> the

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
once you get the flag would finish the

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.020 
once you get the flag would finish the
last<00:06:29.790> step<00:06:30.150> is<00:06:30.390> to<00:06:30.420> trim<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.990> wing<00:06:31.200> and<00:06:31.550> if<00:06:32.550> you

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
last step is to trim the wing and if you

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.430 
last step is to trim the wing and if you
find<00:06:33.300> some<00:06:33.480> of<00:06:33.570> these<00:06:33.630> adults<00:06:33.900> crawling

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
find some of these adults crawling

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.140 
find some of these adults crawling
around<00:06:34.530> on<00:06:34.920> the<00:06:35.040> snow<00:06:35.310> you'll<00:06:35.580> notice<00:06:35.940> that

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
around on the snow you'll notice that

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.020 
around on the snow you'll notice that
their<00:06:36.450> their<00:06:37.410> wings<00:06:37.680> are<00:06:38.130> shorter<00:06:38.760> than<00:06:38.790> their

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
their their wings are shorter than their

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.550 
their their wings are shorter than their
tail<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.480> tail<00:06:39.510> stick<00:06:39.930> out<00:06:40.080> considerably

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
tail the tail stick out considerably

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.350 
tail the tail stick out considerably
from<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.920> wing<00:06:41.100> so<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.490> can<00:06:41.610> make<00:06:41.790> it<00:06:41.970> so<00:06:42.240> the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
from the wing so you can make it so the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.540 
from the wing so you can make it so the
wing<00:06:42.510> just<00:06:42.750> kind<00:06:43.020> of<00:06:43.110> barely<00:06:43.350> goes<00:06:43.800> over<00:06:44.400> the

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
wing just kind of barely goes over the

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.600 
wing just kind of barely goes over the
the<00:06:45.030> abdomen<00:06:45.510> so<00:06:48.770> what<00:06:49.770> I'll<00:06:49.860> usually<00:06:50.070> do<00:06:50.460> is

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
the abdomen so what I'll usually do is

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.170 
the abdomen so what I'll usually do is
just<00:06:50.640> cut<00:06:51.420> it<00:06:51.540> square<00:06:53.360> and<00:06:54.800> then<00:06:56.090> kind<00:06:57.090> of

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
just cut it square and then kind of

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:05.709 
just cut it square and then kind of
round<00:06:57.330> the<00:06:57.420> edges

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:11.049 

and<00:07:06.259> that's<00:07:06.409> it<00:07:06.619> just<00:07:06.769> a<00:07:07.069> quick<00:07:07.629> easy<00:07:10.059> little

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:11.059 
and that's it just a quick easy little

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:18.610 
and that's it just a quick easy little
black<00:07:11.269> stone<00:07:11.569> dry

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.370 

and<00:07:19.160> a<00:07:19.220> great<00:07:19.430> thing<00:07:19.580> about<00:07:19.610> this<00:07:19.970> fly<00:07:20.150> is

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380 
and a great thing about this fly is

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.750 
and a great thing about this fly is
there's<00:07:21.380> not<00:07:21.500> a<00:07:21.560> ton<00:07:21.800> of<00:07:21.860> hackle<00:07:22.250> it's<00:07:22.400> a<00:07:22.460> super

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
there's not a ton of hackle it's a super

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.960 
there's not a ton of hackle it's a super
easy<00:07:22.970> quick<00:07:23.480> tie<00:07:23.750> and<00:07:24.080> there's<00:07:25.070> just<00:07:25.580> enough

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
easy quick tie and there's just enough

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.490 
easy quick tie and there's just enough
hackle<00:07:26.300> upfront<00:07:26.540> that<00:07:26.750> if<00:07:27.050> the<00:07:27.170> fish<00:07:27.380> are

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
hackle upfront that if the fish are

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.170 
hackle upfront that if the fish are
being<00:07:27.650> really<00:07:27.920> aggressive<00:07:28.010> and<00:07:28.700> eating<00:07:29.090> the

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
being really aggressive and eating the

being really aggressive and eating the
females<00:07:29.540> when<00:07:29.720> they're<00:07:29.840> laying<00:07:29.960> eggs<00:07:30.170> that

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
females when they're laying eggs that

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.470 
females when they're laying eggs that
you<00:07:30.620> can<00:07:30.920> grease<00:07:31.190> this<00:07:31.400> fly<00:07:31.640> up<00:07:31.850> and<00:07:32.060> skate<00:07:32.330> it

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:32.480
