00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.720 

this<00:01:52.570> custard<00:01:53.140> definitely<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.160> leaving<00:01:54.610> my

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
this custard definitely is leaving my

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.800 
this custard definitely is leaving my
hair<00:01:55.030> defined<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.170> with<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> lots<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.130> shine

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.450 

next<00:02:01.810> I'll<00:02:01.930> be<00:02:02.050> using<00:02:02.260> this<00:02:02.560> handheld<00:02:03.070> dryer

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
next I'll be using this handheld dryer

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.700 
next I'll be using this handheld dryer
with<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.850> diffuser<00:02:04.330> attachment<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:05.290> combat

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710

shrinkage<00:02:06.280> when<00:02:06.880> tightly<00:02:07.330> coiled<00:02:07.600> hair

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
shrinkage when tightly coiled hair

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.680 
shrinkage when tightly coiled hair
shrinks<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.979> tends<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.460> coil<00:02:09.820> around<00:02:10.030> itself

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
shrinks it tends to coil around itself

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.620 
shrinks it tends to coil around itself
causing<00:02:11.560> tangles<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.190> knots<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.060> tried<00:02:13.480> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
causing tangles and knots so I tried to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.410 
causing tangles and knots so I tried to
avoid<00:02:13.870> shrinkage<00:02:14.440> when<00:02:14.620> possible<00:02:15.060> our<00:02:16.060> hair

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
avoid shrinkage when possible our hair

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.110 
avoid shrinkage when possible our hair
loves<00:02:16.720> moisture<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.560> strong<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
loves moisture and is strong to it the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.210 
loves moisture and is strong to it the
ends<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> hair<00:02:20.050> drive<00:02:20.380> faster<00:02:20.890> than<00:02:21.100> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
ends of the hair drive faster than the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.790 
ends of the hair drive faster than the
roots<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.910> as<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.330> ends<00:02:22.780> dry<00:02:23.140> they<00:02:23.530> draw

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
roots so as the ends dry they draw

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.250 
roots so as the ends dry they draw
closer<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.640> roots<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.480> are<00:02:25.660> still<00:02:25.900> damp

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
closer to the roots that are still damp

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.740 
closer to the roots that are still damp
this<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.130> what<00:02:27.340> causes<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.790> shrinkage<00:02:28.360> effect

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this is what causes the shrinkage effect

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.530 
this is what causes the shrinkage effect
so<00:02:29.290> by<00:02:29.470> drying<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.070> roots<00:02:30.310> first<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.360> can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so by drying the roots first you can

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:49.559 
so by drying the roots first you can
stop<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.990> shrinkage<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.620> its<00:02:32.830> track

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.089 

this<00:02:50.569> is<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> finished<00:02:51.349> look<00:02:51.560> after

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
this is the finished look after

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.520 
this is the finished look after
completing<00:02:52.520> these<00:02:52.760> steps<00:02:52.819> on<00:02:53.300> my<00:02:53.450> entire<00:02:53.840> head
