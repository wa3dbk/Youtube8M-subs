00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.430
 Say I'll try and catch the fish. 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.449
 It will be difficult for you to see. 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.859
 people try 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.439
 before going deeper into this subject 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.980

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.440

 right then it's a very good guy make a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.010
 very cool work in Lent I think 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.240
 that we have to honor the other 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.979
 face that I want to thank 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.229

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.220
 came through youtube to follow the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.979

 I had the opportunity to meet him 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.870

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.930

 Please let us know that we are there to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.780
 for that 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.030
 good beauty is because I call here 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.170
 attempt back because our 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.780
 goal here is while the 40 club 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.750
 top is to make a loyal business 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.610
 so we should have it for this 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.240
 which might be called in my opinion 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.900
 of a biotype, we should have gone 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.510
 searching from the substrate is what kind 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.910
 of sand which is conferred by the notion 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.880
 Do you have any physical characteristics 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.020
 or chemical if it takes into account and 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.110
 this was not done 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.400
 We used a gunshot so it's 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.680
 the sand trunk and two dvd's sloss 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.110
 trunk that forms a cheese is that a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.569
 natural little puppy that fish like 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.019
 much on the function of these absurdities mpx on 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.439
 is temper it so they like it 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.249
 what else the tapa 20 used sheet of 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.560
 almond tree is coming to 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.569
 coloring of the water and are not 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.870
 realizing the video is just botar told ben 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.340
 shahn is playing the same metal 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.389
 my low price hour could have 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.389
 a contrast 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.769
 part of the wall here in sÃ£o paulo to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 crystalline 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.080
 This here is with water as well as tea. 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.670
 good that I can talk about this 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.019
 fish apologize apologize for the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.450
 reflexes for us is very difficult 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.709
 filming here in the store saw them grams 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.959
 have n flashes 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.299
 Okay, I confess that I'm getting deeper. 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.709
 Now, I also want to thank you for the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.440
 fabiano from goiana has helped me 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.780
 identification of species and 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.750
 the characteristics of them 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.090
 the controversy if this really is the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.120
 acise program what we know that 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.160
 it comes from profit to then I obviously 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.260
 that I'm going to divulge I'm going to sell what 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.709
 It came to my invoice of suspicion 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 they are personalized we are not favor 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.329
 here is the collection of 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.329
 fish that are not on a list of 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:04.200
 allowed by ibama personal beauty 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.450
 I know there are 40 and avoid buying fish 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.610
 illegal if you are disturbing 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.490
 the hobbit are helping the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.480
 It 's better not to have the fish than to have 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.830
 a cool fish 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.109
 I think to what he did that he's in the 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.390
 your aquarium that sometimes you find 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.519
 can get lucky legal summer 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.710
 another hundred died in transport because 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.650
 who does this kind of service 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.240
 Often for service the body is 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.330
 You're on any little girl for these 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.330
 they will see that the business is ugly church 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.480
 then look for legalized tx with note 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.580
 Tax is I enjoyed this program 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.830
 because I had never seen 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.690
 Sure I have photos of him our fan page 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.490
 from facebook that I think you can see 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.510
 I do not know if I can 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.680
 watch the video 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:54.040
 but the fish is very good has a 15 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.710
 years but two of yellow on the tail has 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.080
 some marks on the face that are the sides 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.500
 As far as I know we only have a male that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:07.150
 I'll go and bring her to the store. 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.130
 staff purchase females 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.480
 would not be much to see the formation of 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.370
 couple in this aquarium and for now 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.050
 this training I have not worked 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.860
 I went much deeper into the 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.040
 species 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.750
 an interesting shouting thing is that 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.640
 many people that it is a problem that 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.570
 now that should be a water rope 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.070
 the city 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.460
 we try to keep our 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.380
 alkaline utah neutral devices 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.850
 from our experience it has no 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.190
 study to prove this. 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.450
 including 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.710
 The training talked a lot with us. 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:43.290
 about this and in a dose he believes 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.850
 also decreases mortality 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.070
 I'm not going to get too much in here 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.390
 technician or tpi has no time but who 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.240
 Do you want to talk about this? 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.100
 available in the store the fact here the people 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.600
 maintaining the neutral chords for 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.410
 alkaline we have a very 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.650
 smaller 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.620
 is the ideal for you the florist is 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.690
 Hulk is in your house I do not think 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.000
 ideal ideal none extreme 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.030
 okay I think I owe to respect the 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.300
 pilot type but search before has in 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.250
 amazon rivers that are that they differ 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.539
 much between the date the person searches 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.680
 know where you came from with these 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.160
 putting 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.830
 and finally to us it pays that as the 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.050
 people have a greater amount both 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.570
 in the store how much in the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.070
 people are worth tinkering with on the channel for 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.979
 decrease the penalty 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.560
 beauty of rest that working with 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.780
 a margin of entering three vacancies each 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.090
 You're a lady, I used a lot now . 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.759
 shrimp as I wanted something that 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.400
 was more focused to enter and 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.620
 mimetize the effects of the use of the thousand 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.250
 a company, I think it's cool. 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.210
 You do not want to take the video but that's it. 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.690
 there 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.530
 I hope you have enjoyed it and works are 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.530
 for all and until the next
