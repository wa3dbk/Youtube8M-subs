00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 now is November 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.830
 want to have this beauty in the winter 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.439
 windowsill in January and February 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 when there is still snow outside 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.630
 and you have beautiful spring crocuses 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.789
 flowers 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.810
 right sun contribution let's plant with 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.739
 you crocuses 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.370
 on you today we bought five 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 corms of large-flowered crocuses 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.690
 it is the large-flowered ones that are more beautiful 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.410
 look in color when bloom 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.110
 January-February 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.600
 and I prefer the yellow ones anyway 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.480
 the sun is more than spring 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 bring to the apartment so I bought them even 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 a little bit here already sprouts started 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.979
 make your way but it's not scary it's not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 affects the flowering of crocuses now we have them 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.049
 with you we will plant for this I took it smoke 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.659
 eleven and centimeter diameter dish 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.090
 shallow precisely in such dies 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.790
 most better to grow crocus 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.299
 conditions good forcing successful in the frame 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.180
 is the cooling of corms when 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.340
 temperature from zero to nine degrees 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 celsius 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 within three months of landing I am up 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.159
 half fill the bowl universal 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.189
 ground which in the store can 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.280
 use any rub because 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.610
 crocuses will bloom in 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.590
 accumulated nutrient count 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.170
 corms so you can sand 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.720
 claydite any material can even be 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 produce in the arm 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.690
 one here I fell asleep to half a bowl 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.000
 primer and wet it 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.250
 after soil wetting expanding its 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.560
 corms on the perimeter so that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 they did not touch each other and did not touch 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.940
 walls and somewhat deepening each and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.490
 bulbs bloom 4 5 flowers 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:45.720
 that is, if you have a whole bed 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:49.440
 it will turn out here a little bit again 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.070
 water and one of the conditions do not condense 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.620
 cargo tudes all crocuses planted sprinkled 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.540
 ground shed some water and now I 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.000
 I cover and here is such a second spoon 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.060
 in order that with the growth of shoots not 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.680
 warped and send it all 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:16.489
 the construction for three months the fridge is 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.030
 the best place for crocus forcing 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.830
 temperature from zero to nine degrees 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.060
 check humidity periodically 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.010
 substrate 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.239
 in three months when you open 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:34.260
 top shoots should grow and 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:38.100
 be at least five centimeters and here 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.820
 such a cat with grown to five 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.760
 centimeters sprouts expose for 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.410
 flowering first and second day you can 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 put the temperature on the floor 16 15 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.739
 degrees then rearranged on the windowsill 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.739
 but consider at very high temperatures 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.470
 in direct sunlight 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.880
 or additional lighting crocuses 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:09.720
 Crocuses fade away very quickly therefore 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:16.169
 it is better for them to provide a gentle temperature 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.750
 at about 16 and 17 degrees Celsius which 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.680
 temperature 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.000
 just happens on the windowsill after 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.550
 cold window 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.550
 good luck and beautiful bloom
