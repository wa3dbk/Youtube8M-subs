and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:49.570> play<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.780> exact<00:01:51.230> same<00:01:51.440> quartz

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
and then you play the exact same quartz

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.550 
and then you play the exact same quartz
in<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.220> exact<00:01:52.729> same<00:01:52.940> order<00:01:53.150> but<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:54.350> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
in the exact same order but in a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.719 
in the exact same order but in a
different<00:01:55.190> rhythm<00:01:55.700> like<00:01:56.240> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.029 

so<00:02:03.540> only<00:02:03.960> 9th<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.009> 11th

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.610 

so<00:02:08.939> down<00:02:09.269> down<00:02:10.110> up

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.030 

then<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.940> regularly<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.140> down

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.800 

that<00:02:20.110> same<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:21.500> nine<00:02:21.769> in<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.099> eleven

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
that same as in nine in the eleven

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.000 
that same as in nine in the eleven
nineteen<00:02:23.810> eleven<00:02:23.840> that's<00:02:24.200> kind<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.890> awkward

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
nineteen eleven that's kind of awkward

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.119 
nineteen eleven that's kind of awkward
to<00:02:25.580> say<00:02:25.819> in<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.930> music<00:02:27.470> video<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:31.010> know

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
to say in a music video but you know

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.699 
to say in a music video but you know
what<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.340> mean

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:47.130 

so

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:57.510 

then<00:02:47.910> regularly

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.930 

this<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.780> also<00:02:59.140> played<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.280> chorus<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
this is also played in the chorus and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.110 
this is also played in the chorus and
it's<00:03:04.110> played<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.380> exact<00:03:05.830> same<00:03:06.070> way<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:09.640> we

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
it's played the exact same way and so we

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.000 
it's played the exact same way and so we
covered<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.750> chorus<00:03:11.470> as<00:03:11.650> well<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:13.620> there's<00:03:14.620> a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
covered the chorus as well and there's a

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.460 
covered the chorus as well and there's a
short<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.960> now<00:03:17.410> how<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.620> call<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.100> well<00:03:18.790> bridge
