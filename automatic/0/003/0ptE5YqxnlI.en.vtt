00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
piece that jumped off the piston if you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
piece that jumped off the piston if you
could<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:57.649> detonated<00:00:59.239> blew<00:01:00.239> off<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
could see that detonated blew off a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.789 
could see that detonated blew off a
chunk<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> piston<00:01:03.290> off<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> front

chunk of the piston off the front
they're<00:01:07.430> guessing<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
they're guessing it put it through the
