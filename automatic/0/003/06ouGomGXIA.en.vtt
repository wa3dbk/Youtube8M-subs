 the family of the future the sea 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.050
 So I believe in the house of the pinks. 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.340
 this game is based on the hunger crisis in the future 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.650
 by the way until after 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 I hired film assisted to academic 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.970
 fantasy 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.920
 meireles and moutinho was launched this year Germany already in the case in fact 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.580
 our 2007 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.000
 none of this 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 I wanted to watch you, story hit the story here. 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.050
 contracted in the case of a crop 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.580
 my most recent of him the movie too 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.330
 The story is more or less battisti the characters are the same 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.019
 what is the boy came out unscathed 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.159
 that I remember him and his grandfather 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.920
 It is what changes is the most 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.010
 so with respect to the appeared with the characters in some places that do not 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.519
 shoot for 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.539
 so some slightly different stories 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.159
 as for example the goal I understand 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
 it is the missions that are being given 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.349
 His goal is to get into the garage. 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.959
 because he had to take that ship 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.439
 who has a ship that travels through time for his father 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.969
 take that ship he collects photos of old people 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.339
 so to get in the garage he'll have to look here for some 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.799
 equipment 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.120
 between these equipments because it was 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.929
 garage access code 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.019

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.699
 - this was during the first year of the new year but tobacco was confusing 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.669
 Kung Fu film, the minister also reminded that the team has a 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.689
 from the chosen locations to a hidden wall 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.629

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.739
 they sing efe 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:54.980
 Why a source? 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:59.840
 I'm already in a 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.109
 the lime module 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.249
 the product saw 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.120
 the point is that in the film are motifs different cavour holland motif 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.639

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.800
 Astori is also very cool of what has to do the temple get a piece 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.500
 after entering a machine on this machine and joining the part with a 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.650
 something else that is collected and assembles a new, very cool weapon 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.960
 and the game has already given 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.139
 he fell 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.379

 I do not have a password for the safe 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.020

 otherwise you're done 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.599
 starting again must begin a phase 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.919

 I really like the program I always tell my friends to watch. 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:58.759
 I was commenting with the superman of those who had a bit of care to record 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.569
 dvds 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.539

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.749
 dvds compact movies and everything else 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:11.069
 I love programming and I do not lose a hug to everyone with that tip of yours that I 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:13.809
 I thought my skin got the silver back 

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:17.089
 however something to see that is an example of this is true 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:18.910
 worries me 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.360
 coming back to the band 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.449
 is because it is complicated in such a short time explains that an easy way 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:29.509
 in the show to record a dvd without any serious damage they also see that the people 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:30.809
 presents the 

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:32.169
 the organ 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:36.409
 any definition the best is that it was pure truth that I was told 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:39.169
 be approved by the House and the Federal Senate. 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:42.909
 in the staff there from são paulo that accompanies us to the open tv it came 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:44.270
 after the block 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.470

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.610
