00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.920
 very clear there are others who are a little 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.039
 darker and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.829
 it's up to you to start 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.530
 try or the one you like most this is 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.890
 super white good come super

 and it has like golden flashes 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.630
 what 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.390
 you do not see much the next two tones 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.229
 or colors is the range of roses over 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.229
 all the filias or fuchsias in colors or 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.459
 more alive roses but you can cheer up 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.320
 also for a light pink 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:33.830
 for example this one that is pearly 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.750
 it's a lighter pink to the flows something 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.970
 more more than a little more towards 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.780
 violets 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.780
 this one here 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.250
 what is a pink a little more magenta and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.790
 Well, we're talking about more roses and philias 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.790
 vibrant 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.540
 It is a very very striking pink and very 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.610
 vibrant and remember that when you occupy 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.160
 this kind of very striking colors the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.980
 eyes should be very neutral no matter 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.650
 the skin tone that you have this that is 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.860
 as getting a little more to the 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.980
 reddish but also among roses is 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.470
 common 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.470
 pink plus cherry 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.760
 and it's a matter of you just like in 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 any range of tones you go 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.970
 testing which one you like which one is 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.880
 the one that catches your attention by continuing 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.640
 with the colors follow the reds on 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.160
 all the reds that are intense the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.610
 vibrant reds also reds 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.900
 cherries for example this here that is 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.689
 a light red 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.450
 it's like a blood red an apple red 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.620
 is this shade of red that is a bit 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.620
 more obscure 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.010
 which is like a cherry tone 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.970
 and finally of the reds this is a 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.970
 red burnt 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.160
 and continuing with and talking about browns 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.390
 as well 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.330
 the brown colors chocolates are very 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.330
 good to the brunettes and I have you 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.740
 a sample for example this that is a 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.680
 red a reddish brown that unlike 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.510
 of the reds is more coming to the tone of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.630
 the brown pears and even the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.850
 red wine tones or bambi that call them 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.430
 and how chocolate is this here that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.530
 it's practically a coffee and you can 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.100
 hear in different shades of coffee 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.830
 Trying those that you like the most and 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.380
 with which you feel comfortable 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.870
 it's this here that this is a coffee a 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.130
 chocolate tone very clear but as they 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.460
 I say, you can try different 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.490
 tonalities and if you do not dare to use 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.330
 leave the road so much color in 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.570
 lips 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.040
 you can go testing with the gloss is that 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.720
 now they are very easy to 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.570
 get and sell everywhere that you 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.010
 they leave a little color for example if not 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.790
 you like to use something so it's very 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:16.739
 eye-catching you can start with with gloss 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.260
 is for example the newborn stand 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.989
 there are many presentations from 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.580
 example leaves you a touch of color 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.340
 here is a bit of color left and not 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.990
 It is as intense as if it were a 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.910
 lipstick because that is what I bring 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.310
 right now they have as a 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.310
 tonality plus coffee 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.320
 but they are not ready is for example 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.320
 this 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:52.340
 that leaves you the same tone 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:56.230
 but it is more clear and more tenuous and a 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.230
 little more discreet as it had equal 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.870
 for example this 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.870
 and also there are even brown things 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.340
 with hand 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.519
 you can ask your friends your 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.279
 familiar to your mom your boyfriend to you 

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:20.409
 husband can tell you in what if 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.959
 tevez the tone of the colors that if you 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.300
 I recommend that you stay away from the 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.180
 orange tones 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.120
 for example these here try a little 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.830
 that shade a little orange you 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.110
 I recommend that you approach the 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.810
 line towards the range of corals but 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.330
 Oranges like these I do not recommend it 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.909
 for nothing since as they have a bit of 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.310
 scare us yellows make your skin go 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.010
 see 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.640
 a bit off or that the contrast does not 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.640
 it's pretty 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.640
 but you still do not lose anything with checking 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.950
 the jokes that you feel comfortable if I 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.480

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.160
 This range of lipsticks to give you 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.780
