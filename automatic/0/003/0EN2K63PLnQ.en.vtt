00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Gunpra Kitt Review of the Memories Heavy Duty Machine L Gaim 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 Permanent heavy metal oj 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.210
 Auger is a permanent series metal that appears in the anime heavy fighter L Gaim overwhelming performance 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 In the middle of the anime 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.540
 The aircraft that appeared in the animation in heavy metal transmitted to the female dul house is a replica 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 The sister who is the 13-man is also lent out in half 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.770
 Aircraft other aircraft boarding the pilot other than she also was overwhelmed by the Gaim is to steer 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.690
 Shima 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:35.140
 Originally the place due to the Kan Mamoru Nagano's located in Wiesbaden metal so there is only 1 aircraft but 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.970
 It is said that the decision has appeared without the intention 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.000
 Along with El Gaim, it is also the aircraft that Mamoru Nagano has released the most numerous refinements . 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.550
 The auger sculls that appear in the cartoon five star stories 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.760
 It is connected with the machine messier oj 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.129
 Heaven comes out in the final story 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:57.199
 Also door ze reaction sister is basically just has a sort prince personality Dar of God ride dress be Once 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:01.129
 Also be of that it ze same as all the same thing in and have been variously said Toka ze pudding large 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.990
 The design is designed to increase the range of movement by reference to the Auger plastic model 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.290
 It is said to have 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.400
 It is a kit of 1/144, but the price is 500 yen 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.580
 The part was a small kit , but it was a cool kit that was made quite well 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.350
 As the molding color is all yellow, the paint is not good 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.550
 I'm sure General of the species was Taeï½° Ru armor Takeshi at the time of the child's troubles did not know Toka surfacer 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.010
 It can be said that 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:28.140
 The saver is attached but the shaver blade part is not attached 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.900
 It is still good enough only for the minute with a long spear that requires a detailed modification 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.050
 However 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.520
 Saber of the parts of the end for much strength even reinforced with supplementary brass line can not be ensured appropriate 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 After bonding the parts 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:47.680
 This work was quick to duplicate, especially for augers, and in the binder on both shoulders 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.890
 Replicate to reproduce it because it has stored more than 30 slow lancers 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.460
 I had no choice but to 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.850
 By the way, surely it comes with a nine throw Lancer 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.810
 If you think and quite odd number is Ne now now 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 Drill a hole on the beam saber blade attached to the master grade gunpla 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.880
 Until a little before you use the tool to sandwich the one Lancer The 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 It is a kit that has been knocked out, but recently it has become slightly premiere as it seems to be scarce 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.060
 I will
