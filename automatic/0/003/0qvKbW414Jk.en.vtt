 Brazil the three models of the 500 family 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 main features 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 good is they the family comes from a concept 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.739
 which we launched in the 700 family in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 Europe 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 when we launched a scooter the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.760
 mannequin and a crossover and now after 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 A little later on, a custom with the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 same chassis engine base 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.280

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.109

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.579

 500 x 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.910
 this engine is 500 to the letter to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.440
 The following courses are as if they were taken 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.330
 this single cylinder 50 x 2 then 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.830
 he has this same concept is a motor 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.740
 with double liquid cooled control 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.740
 the latest generation is just that the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.080
 It has roletados and 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.340
 brings a lot of smoothness of operation 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.110
 we built this engine for

 make the ringtone turn more 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.440
 low 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.200
 let's say that with urban use 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.180
 extremely smooth and economical 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.930
 it also offers fun and 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.930
 performance

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.800
 easy to pilot and fairly balanced 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.810
 progressive linear 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.340
 the abs is quite efficient now to be 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.930
 a sales success 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.930
