 hello everyone with you i'm christ i'm not i would 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.780
 wanted to show 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 6 and 7 videos 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 what can you do and snow 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.039
 Now I will show you how to do it. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.480
 fly machine for this in it understand 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.910
 such two sticks 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:32.239
 there we will need such a china 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.820
 connect them then take such a wheel 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:41.329
 connect it all we got here 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 so here you can say Czech 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:49.140
 Now this may seem like 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.600
 the interroom itself is not the same cart 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.800
 there will be a car then we take it like this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.859
 connect dressed him so we take more 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.439
 One detail we connect them like this with us 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.760
 they came out but the base of the car with wheels 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:12.000
 then we connect this one here then 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.500
 turn over and here we are already closing everything 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.850
 that was somehow more beautiful looks all 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 It will like this does not paint a pretty nice 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.110
 will be 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.579
 we connect we connect and the last detail 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.479
 here is all of us the foundation is ready 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.630
 this is the base here so it looks 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630
 and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.430
 and then we take such a detail 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.390
 we connect like this 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.360
 and that's how we got it 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.230
 little year sick 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:06.400
 then take these parts do 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:09.959
 everything is the same as here we are connecting for 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 stuck together 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:24.250
 so we connect all Circuits enough not 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:27.190
 picked up messing about all the parts I took 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:36.910
 so that you can create a car or not 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:40.360
