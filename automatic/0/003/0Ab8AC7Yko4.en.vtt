00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.029
 sometimes it becomes more like the first video, but I still see it a lot 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.030
 is also very much like it 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.829
 knows both sides today 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.999
 newspaper clipping on you 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:17.549
 rtl make that you needed for that, there can be the pieces 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.260
 Steenwijk 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.630
 drive there and is under attack 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.669
 the bad luck that these use vincent 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:26.769
 the ankle 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.669
 unthinkable 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.699
 gabon we find and not appreciated and hanging there 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 and without stars then it really is no longer possible 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.900
 if you are purely for the location 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.100
 with that name are very dry because if there is less to invest in Rotterdam 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.360
 is going well now but you are when you reveal to him the newspaper 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.310
 dane keeps on sticking to it and dancing that is indispensable 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
 further of course it is better to wait if you see green links and the sgp 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 o'clock 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.110
 it's not allowed 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.410
 students and 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.410
 a group belongs in this color 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 this time his job was not doing 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.680
 9 before this had done all and these errors 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.670
 you should never forget to do that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.890
 what 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.430
 the niaz the fair play price very good follow-up 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.740
 leave you one 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.140
 a role in the heart that is a bit disappointing to make it pieces 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.030
 better he is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 from that mac you chance you cannot get into it 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 chase the big role and yes r 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.040
 year up a bit 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 and then again a short-sighted one too 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.550
 and then you have m 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.890
 Newspaper clipping with the sidewalk you stand the chance that this kind of closet space will come vertical 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.190
 and horizontal 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.620
 a year you can know yourself how you are doing 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.250
 I would go for the profit 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 be in there 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.179
 but it is also a role 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.479
 also in 2010 and 2 and this is not yet known 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.599
 on scrapers juve 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 marchetti of course handy are sick 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.759
 you always recognize the best time in between 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.409
 an i 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.439
 that is of course large nrc.next 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.849
 also use gb 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.609
 and then you have again in health care network also in amstelveen is from Mark Wilson I am 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.609
 not known the wheel itself 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.459
 I do 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.799
 3 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.799
 to 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:16.419
 years more and therefore also with no intervention because the beach tents quiet 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.889
 prof 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.869
 the euro gave up rather than the legs 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.119
 Hey 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.309
 it is good protection 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.569
 because if you like it and not unlike anything else it will go very fast 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.180
 quickly you can easily at the drugstore also just in the counter 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.390
 gets into trouble but of course you don't need the entire album because that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.249
 is such a number plate off 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.249
 we have never been short legs this way 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 rather it was catalans 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.509
 and then 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:16.999
 Then you are 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:20.169
 ready for the two fingers 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.539
 libertÃ© newspaper five times out 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.539
 a 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.580
 you have to be careful that you flat the entire region 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.580
 otherwise you get an opinion what they think 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.729
 and that while it was a very beautiful time 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.650
 I can finally get one 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.470
 we have 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.160
 3 for health and safety and special 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430
 year m the game 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.469
 the 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.050
 lee 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.050
 In addition, find one it looks on paper 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.490
 It is possible that those are clients who heard something 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.830
 and there also come test of it is very big 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.240
 Which 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 through the winter 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:40.559
 if you grab it feet bun march is not completely the world of 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.559
 ask for reconciliation 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.589
 edit or shorten remco 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.550
 beh 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.280
 then the nothing 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.889
 more than a year earlier 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.889
 but you can 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.710
 to see the study 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.369
 a 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.550
 the hunter 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.259
 a year bert eod and 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:29.839
 anp 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.839
 9 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.919
 anp 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.159
 I hope that you look at it as before, in the short term
