at the side view of the car you will

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
at the side view of the car you will
notice<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.210> probably<00:01:12.479> the

notice that this is probably the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.490 
notice that this is probably the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
sleekest SAV that we have ever done we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.179 
sleekest SAV that we have ever done we
have<00:01:16.650> two<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.610> sharp<00:01:18.180> lines<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.229> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
have two very sharp lines this one that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
have two very sharp lines this one that
incorporates<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.390> door<00:01:21.600> handles<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.200> that

incorporates the door handles and that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
incorporates the door handles and that
goes<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.860> towards<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> rear<00:01:23.670> lamps<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> then

picked up in the body side again and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.960 
picked up in the body side again and
runs<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.380> front<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.369> line
