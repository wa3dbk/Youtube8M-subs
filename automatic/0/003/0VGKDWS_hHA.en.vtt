00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
go up the side and find the middle and

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.410 
go up the side and find the middle and
using<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.160> bridge<00:02:55.310> method<00:02:55.730> go<00:02:55.880> down<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.269> cut

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
using the bridge method go down and cut

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.530 
using the bridge method go down and cut
your<00:02:56.540> Apple<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:56.959> half<00:02:57.730> okay<00:02:58.870> slap<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.900> down

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
your Apple in half okay slap it down

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.420 
your Apple in half okay slap it down
break<00:03:02.540> method<00:03:02.989> again<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.709> push<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.310> half

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
break method again and push it in half

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.490 
break method again and push it in half
same<00:03:07.430> thing<00:03:07.670> again<00:03:08.470> using<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> bridge<00:03:09.769> method

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500

this is the part where you take it off

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.140 
this is the part where you take it off
up<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:13.330> then<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.630> just<00:05:13.840> slide<00:05:14.290> your
