the ones here from blue and are a little
bit<00:01:21.900> larger<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> could<00:01:22.890> say<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.340> it's

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
bit larger and you could say that it's

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
bit larger and you could say that it's
also<00:01:23.970> kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.420> bulky<00:01:24.869> however<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> the

also kind of bulky however one of the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.770 
also kind of bulky however one of the
main<00:01:26.400> advantages<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> particular

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
main advantages of this particular

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.890 
main advantages of this particular
design<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.369> has<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:29.939> snug<00:01:30.329> fit<00:01:30.689> in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
design is that it has a more snug fit in

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.080 
design is that it has a more snug fit in
the<00:01:31.049> ear<00:01:31.200> due<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> fact<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> our<00:01:32.820> ear

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the ear due to the fact that our ear

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
the ear due to the fact that our ear
actually<00:01:33.570> has<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.140> around<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.740> back

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
actually has to go around the back

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
actually has to go around the back
portion<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> holds<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> place

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
portion of it so it holds it in place

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.890 
portion of it so it holds it in place
while<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.670> buds<00:01:39.030> themselves<00:01:39.720> are

little bit more stability when it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
little bit more stability when it's
actually<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.189> our<00:01:56.369> yep<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:57.270> alternative

they have a spongy type of tip too which

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.450 
they have a spongy type of tip too which
allows<00:02:00.570> some<00:02:00.869> background<00:02:01.680> noise<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.070> come<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
allows some background noise to come in

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
allows some background noise to come in
and<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.180> useful<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.170> you're

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and that's kind of useful so when you're

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
and that's kind of useful so when you're
running<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.100> you're<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> busy<00:02:05.969> area<00:02:06.210> let's

in<00:02:09.149> front<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.539> you'll<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.110> able<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.319> hear

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
in front of you you'll be able to hear

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.820 
in front of you you'll be able to hear
it<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> will<00:02:11.610> pass<00:02:11.849> through

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830

blue<00:04:11.940> hand-pump<00:04:12.840> HD<00:04:13.260> sport<00:04:13.739> buds<00:04:14.040> has<00:04:14.430> a

blue hand-pump HD sport buds has a

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.340 
blue hand-pump HD sport buds has a
unique<00:04:14.970> element<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.660> fact<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.229> is

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
unique element the fact that it is

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.529 
unique element the fact that it is
waterproof<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.190> rugged<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.450> to

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
waterproof and rugged so it's going to

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.539 
waterproof and rugged so it's going to
be<00:04:18.660> more<00:04:19.350> than<00:04:19.530> usable<00:04:19.829> if<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.280> really

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
be more than usable if you get really

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.190 
be more than usable if you get really
rigorous<00:04:21.030> with<00:04:21.180> your<00:04:21.330> workouts<00:04:21.810> or<00:04:21.989> if<00:04:22.080> you're

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
rigorous with your workouts or if you're

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.830 
rigorous with your workouts or if you're
going<00:04:22.289> to<00:04:22.380> be<00:04:22.470> using<00:04:23.070> them<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.340> rain

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
going to be using them in the rain

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.510 
going to be using them in the rain
or<00:04:23.900> even<00:04:24.139> taking<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.500> dip<00:04:24.680> in<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.889> pool<00:04:24.919> you

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
or even taking a dip in the pool you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.129 
or even taking a dip in the pool you
could<00:04:25.669> still<00:04:25.940> kind<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.240> use<00:04:26.419> them<00:04:26.660> without

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
could still kind of use them without

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.650 
could still kind of use them without
worry<00:04:27.560> about<00:04:27.830> them<00:04:28.250> getting<00:04:28.430> damaged<00:04:29.030> we<00:04:29.480> like

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
worry about them getting damaged we like

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.970 
worry about them getting damaged we like
the<00:04:29.810> fact<00:04:29.990> that<00:04:30.139> these<00:04:30.350> are<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> little<00:04:30.710> more

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
the fact that these are a little more

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.560 
the fact that these are a little more
secure<00:04:31.430> than<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:31.910> those<00:04:31.970> other<00:04:32.150> devices

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
secure than some of those other devices

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.689 
secure than some of those other devices
just<00:04:32.960> because<00:04:33.290> they<00:04:33.530> go<00:04:33.740> over<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> e<00:04:34.250> around

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
just because they go over the e around

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.270 
just because they go over the e around
the<00:04:34.850> back<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.570> course<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.380> have<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.770> snug

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
the back and of course you have the snug

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.879 
the back and of course you have the snug
fit<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.940> earbuds<00:04:38.360> themselves<00:04:38.570> but<00:04:39.440> the

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
fit of the earbuds themselves but the

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.070 
fit of the earbuds themselves but the
design<00:04:40.190> isn't<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.820> most<00:04:41.000> compact<00:04:41.540> of<00:04:41.780> course

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
design isn't the most compact of course

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.320 
design isn't the most compact of course
that's<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.560> trade<00:04:42.830> off<00:04:43.010> with<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.669> as<00:04:44.120> far

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
that's the trade off with it and as far

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.390 
that's the trade off with it and as far
as<00:04:44.389> battery<00:04:45.020> life<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.530> ready<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.040> give<00:04:46.190> 8

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
as battery life it's ready to give 8

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.270 
as battery life it's ready to give 8
hours<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:47.000> playback<00:04:47.510> but<00:04:48.110> an<00:04:48.229> hour<00:04:48.410> test<00:04:48.770> it

only<00:04:49.460> managed<00:04:49.729> to<00:04:49.820> get<00:04:49.940> half<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:50.720> a

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
only managed to get half of that a

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.689 
only managed to get half of that a
little<00:04:51.020> bit<00:04:51.229> over<00:04:51.470> 4<00:04:51.770> hours<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.460> then<00:04:52.610> again

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
little bit over 4 hours but then again

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.909 
little bit over 4 hours but then again
we<00:04:53.300> did<00:04:53.510> have<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.930> place<00:04:54.199> at<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.560> lattice

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
we did have it place at the lattice

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.370 
we did have it place at the lattice
