00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of still have a weak signal and I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.649 
of still have a weak signal and I
usually<00:01:11.159> impost<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> raise<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.330> maybe

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
usually impost have to raise it up maybe

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
usually impost have to raise it up maybe
10<00:01:13.049> 12<00:01:13.500> DB<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.790> pretty<00:01:15.060> decent<00:01:16.340> signal

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
10 12 DB and it's a pretty decent signal

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
10 12 DB and it's a pretty decent signal
in<00:01:17.460> terms<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> noise<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.240> doesn't<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
in terms of noise it doesn't have that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
in terms of noise it doesn't have that
much<00:01:18.930> noise<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:20.460> has<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
much noise this has a kind of a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
much noise this has a kind of a
different<00:01:21.750> gain<00:01:21.869> structure<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.189> again

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
different gain structure in it and again

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.820 
different gain structure in it and again
I<00:01:23.670> come<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.119> audio<00:01:24.330> background<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I come from an audio background and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.980 
I come from an audio background and
maybe<00:01:26.040> none<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> guys<00:01:27.299> run<00:01:27.600> into<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
maybe none of you guys run into this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
maybe none of you guys run into this
because<00:01:28.340> maybe<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.579> hearing<00:01:29.850> things<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
because maybe I'm hearing things that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
because maybe I'm hearing things that
maybe<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.720> guys<00:01:30.869> aren't<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.220> gives

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
maybe you guys aren't but it this gives

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
maybe you guys aren't but it this gives
off<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.939> somewhat<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> digital<00:01:33.930> sounding

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
off a somewhat of a digital sounding

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
off a somewhat of a digital sounding
noise<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> via<00:01:36.329> mic<00:01:36.540> Pro<00:01:36.750> when

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you use the internal mic you don't hear

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.740 
you use the internal mic you don't hear
it<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
it and what I do is I'm going to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.969 
it and what I do is I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.740> I've<00:01:40.829> also

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
demonstrate that now because I've also

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.999 
demonstrate that now because I've also
have<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> contact<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.360> road<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.049> they<00:01:43.740> asked

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
have a contact with road and they asked

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
have a contact with road and they asked
me<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.579> video<00:01:44.909> real<00:01:45.090> quick<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.659> they

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
me to make this video real quick so they

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
me to make this video real quick so they
can<00:01:46.020> understand<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:47.430> hearing<00:01:47.820> because

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
can understand what I'm hearing because

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.670 
can understand what I'm hearing because
they<00:01:48.210> had<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> dh4<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.380> gave<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> back

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
they had a dh4 but they gave it back

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.980 
they had a dh4 but they gave it back
they<00:01:50.040> didn't<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> chance<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.149> test<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
they didn't have a chance to test it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.749 
they didn't have a chance to test it
with<00:01:52.170> their<00:01:52.320> own<00:01:52.409> mic<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.250> we're<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> do

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
with their own mic so we're going to do

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
with their own mic so we're going to do
right<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.259> totally

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
right now is I'm going to be totally

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.630 
right now is I'm going to be totally
quiet<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.130> me<00:01:59.280> return

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
quiet and then when I you see me return

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.300 
quiet and then when I you see me return
I'll<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.090> recording<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> gh4<00:02:03.170> audio

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
I'll be recording it with the gh4 audio

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.499 
I'll be recording it with the gh4 audio
same<00:02:05.310> position<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> connect

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
same position I'm just going to connect

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.789 
same position I'm just going to connect
it<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.619> can

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it right up to here and then you can

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.199 
it right up to here and then you can
hear<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> difference<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
hear the difference I'm not going to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.240 
hear the difference I'm not going to
apply<00:02:09.330> any<00:02:09.629> noise<00:02:09.899> reduction<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.410> anything<00:02:10.590> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
apply any noise reduction or anything so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.949 
apply any noise reduction or anything so
I'm<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.550> quiet<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:11.879> about<00:02:12.180> five<00:02:12.900> or

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
I'm going to be quiet for about five or

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.910 
I'm going to be quiet for about five or
ten<00:02:13.170> seconds<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.709> you'll

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
ten seconds and you'll

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:26.630 
ten seconds and you'll
see<00:02:14.010> me<00:02:14.190> cut<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.849> microphone

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.220 

all<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.510> should<00:02:27.750> hear<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> little

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
all right so you should hear a little

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.900 
all right so you should hear a little
bit<00:02:28.319> more<00:02:28.500> noise<00:02:28.740> now<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.190> we're<00:02:29.340> using<00:02:29.490> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
bit more noise now that we're using the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.640 
bit more noise now that we're using the
rode<00:02:30.750> videomic<00:02:30.990> pro<00:02:31.140> right<00:02:31.980> into<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.520> gh4<00:02:33.650> I'm

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
rode videomic pro right into the gh4 I'm

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
rode videomic pro right into the gh4 I'm
pretty<00:02:34.950> close<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.150> say<00:02:36.420> I'm<00:02:36.569> probably

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
pretty close I would say I'm probably

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170 
pretty close I would say I'm probably
less<00:02:37.500> than<00:02:37.530> 2<00:02:37.830> feet<00:02:37.860> I'd<00:02:38.190> say<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.490> baby<00:02:38.640> 18

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
less than 2 feet I'd say it baby 18

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
set at zero there's no way I can do it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.790

there's<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.230> enough<00:02:50.090> pad<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.690> want

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
there's just not enough pad if you want

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.180 
there's just not enough pad if you want
or<00:02:52.739> more<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.790> line<00:02:54.030> level<00:02:54.270> input<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
or more of a line level input it's a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.650 
or more of a line level input it's a
little<00:02:56.430> bit<00:02:56.550> too<00:02:56.700> sensitive<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.330> wish<00:02:57.510> they

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
little bit too sensitive I wish they

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.030 
little bit too sensitive I wish they
would<00:02:57.840> bring<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> little<00:02:58.500> bit<00:02:58.709> if

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
would bring it down a little bit if

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.350 
would bring it down a little bit if
there's<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.340> way<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.459> do<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.940> firmware

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
there's a way to do that in firmware

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.080 
there's a way to do that in firmware
that<00:03:00.390> would<00:03:00.600> be<00:03:00.690> awesome<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:02.550> could<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.910> as

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
that would be awesome so I could get as

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.050 
that would be awesome so I could get as
much<00:03:03.840> signal<00:03:04.320> out<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.440> here<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.070> then<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
much signal out of here and then you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.970 
much signal out of here and then you
know<00:03:06.239> bring<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.110> down<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.500> far<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.920> could

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
know bring this down as far as I could

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.740 
know bring this down as far as I could
let<00:03:08.550> all<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> work<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.150> done<00:03:09.330> at<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
let all the work be done at the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.590 
let all the work be done at the
microphone<00:03:10.200> level<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.370> what<00:03:12.060> I've<00:03:12.150> got<00:03:12.209> here

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
microphone level so what I've got here

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.949 
microphone level so what I've got here
is<00:03:12.780> they<00:03:12.900> got<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.050> minus<00:03:13.410> 12<00:03:13.620> DB<00:03:14.660> lowest<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.840> can

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
is they got a minus 12 DB lowest I can

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.250 
is they got a minus 12 DB lowest I can
go<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> pan<00:03:16.650> ASEC<00:03:16.920> gh4<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.200> said

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
go on the pan ASEC gh4 and like I said

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.870 
go on the pan ASEC gh4 and like I said
it's<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.590> zero<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.130> what<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.760> is

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
it's at zero and what I have to do is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640 
it's at zero and what I have to do is
since<00:03:21.030> I'm<00:03:21.150> talking<00:03:21.390> relatively<00:03:22.110> close<00:03:22.350> as

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
since I'm talking relatively close as

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.040 
since I'm talking relatively close as
actually<00:03:23.550> idea<00:03:23.820> add<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.209> limiter<00:03:24.570> because

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
actually idea add the limiter because

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.780 
actually idea add the limiter because
there<00:03:25.290> sometimes<00:03:25.650> will<00:03:25.830> all<00:03:25.920> peak<00:03:26.190> out<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
there sometimes will all peak out that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.220 
there sometimes will all peak out that
I've<00:03:26.940> noticed<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.420> other<00:03:27.630> recordings<00:03:28.110> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
I've noticed in other recordings that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.620 
I've noticed in other recordings that
I've<00:03:28.320> done<00:03:28.470> I'll<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:30.300> know<00:03:30.420> hit

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
I've done I'll actually you know hit

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.720 
I've done I'll actually you know hit
that<00:03:30.810> limiter<00:03:31.140> pretty<00:03:31.350> hard<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.280> does<00:03:32.700> a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
that limiter pretty hard and it does a

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.030 
that limiter pretty hard and it does a
pretty<00:03:32.940> good<00:03:33.090> job<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.420> protecting<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.260> if

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
pretty good job of protecting it so if

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.680 
pretty good job of protecting it so if
you<00:03:35.250> ever<00:03:35.370> wonder<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.030> would<00:03:36.150> use<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.600> or

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
you ever wonder if you would use it or

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.210 
you ever wonder if you would use it or
not<00:03:36.840> I'd<00:03:37.049> say<00:03:37.320> definitely<00:03:37.650> use<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:37.950> because<00:03:38.130> it

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
not I'd say definitely use it because it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.830 
not I'd say definitely use it because it
sounds<00:03:38.489> pretty<00:03:38.670> decent<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.360> too<00:03:39.600> harsh

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
sounds pretty decent it's not too harsh

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.550 
sounds pretty decent it's not too harsh
a<00:03:40.140> few<00:03:41.010> Peaks<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.489> get<00:03:41.670> through<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.560> sound

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
a few Peaks can get through and sound

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.319 
a few Peaks can get through and sound
distorted<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> most<00:03:44.850> part<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.180> does

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
distorted but for the most part it does

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.460 
distorted but for the most part it does
a<00:03:45.360> pretty<00:03:45.600> decent<00:03:45.690> job<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:49.049> what<00:03:49.230> she

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
a pretty decent job so the what she

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.530 
a pretty decent job so the what she
should<00:03:49.739> have<00:03:49.890> heard<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:51.329> kind<00:03:51.510> of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
should have heard is this kind of

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.000 
should have heard is this kind of
digital<00:03:51.959> noise<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.470> what<00:03:52.590> I'm<00:03:52.680> going<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.829> do

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
digital noise and what I'm going to do

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.800 
digital noise and what I'm going to do
now<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> raise<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.630> volume

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
now is I'm going to raise the volume

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.710 
now is I'm going to raise the volume
right<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:55.739> I'm<00:03:55.860> going<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.070> -12<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:57.540> going

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
right now I'm going to -12 and I'm going

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.780 
right now I'm going to -12 and I'm going
to<00:03:57.750> head<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.140> raise<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.650> now<00:03:59.250> we're<00:03:59.400> at<00:03:59.489> minus

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
to head and raise it now we're at minus

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.750 
to head and raise it now we're at minus
10<00:04:00.530> 8<00:04:02.660> 6<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.709> try<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.920> talk<00:04:05.160> quieter<00:04:05.579> because

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
10 8 6 and I try to talk quieter because

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:17.060 
10 8 6 and I try to talk quieter because
it's<00:04:05.940> probably<00:04:06.209> get<00:04:06.360> louder<00:04:06.600> 5<00:04:07.940> 4<00:04:09.560> 3<00:04:11.420> 2<00:04:13.220> 1<00:04:14.780> 0

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
it's probably get louder 5 4 3 2 1 0

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.050 
it's probably get louder 5 4 3 2 1 0
and<00:04:17.570> near<00:04:18.570> i'm<00:04:18.720> at<00:04:18.960> i<00:04:18.990> plus<00:04:19.110> six<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.670> i'm<00:04:20.820> try<00:04:21.000> to

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and near i'm at i plus six so i'm try to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.870 
and near i'm at i plus six so i'm try to
talk<00:04:21.270> pretty<00:04:21.480> quiet<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:23.400> should<00:04:23.610> hear

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
talk pretty quiet and you should hear

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.840 
talk pretty quiet and you should hear
this<00:04:24.090> kind<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.950> digital<00:04:25.950> noise<00:04:26.370> what<00:04:26.700> i'd<00:04:26.820> call

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
this kind of digital noise what i'd call

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.430 
this kind of digital noise what i'd call
it<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:28.800> sounds<00:04:29.760> pretty<00:04:29.840> nasty<00:04:30.840> when<00:04:31.350> you

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
it and it sounds pretty nasty when you

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.640 
it and it sounds pretty nasty when you
bring<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.770> up<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:33.720> can<00:04:33.840> put<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:33.990> noise<00:04:34.170> gate<00:04:34.200> on

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
bring it up you can put a noise gate on

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.970 
bring it up you can put a noise gate on
it<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.040> you<00:04:35.730> could<00:04:35.910> put<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.710> lot<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.860> different

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
it and you could put a lot of different

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.960 
it and you could put a lot of different
things<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:39.740> dobby<00:04:40.740> audition<00:04:41.160> has<00:04:41.790> some

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
want to use it so I'm going to bring

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
want to use it so I'm going to bring
this<00:04:47.640> back<00:04:47.850> down<00:04:48.120> again

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.360 

alright<00:04:51.510> now<00:04:51.690> we're<00:04:51.900> back<00:04:52.080> down<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.650> minus

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
alright now we're back down to minus

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.310 
alright now we're back down to minus
twelve<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:53.970> could<00:04:54.090> talk<00:04:54.270> like<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> normal

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
twelve and I could talk like a normal

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.070 
twelve and I could talk like a normal
volume<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:56.480> basically<00:04:57.480> what's<00:04:57.690> happening

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
volume so basically what's happening

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.840 
volume so basically what's happening
here<00:04:58.260> is<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:59.190> know<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.340> reached<00:04:59.640> out<00:04:59.790> to

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
here is you know I reached out to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.550 
here is you know I reached out to
Panasonic<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:00.840> they're<00:05:01.080> really<00:05:01.290> nice<00:05:01.500> and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
Panasonic and they're really nice and

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.710 
Panasonic and they're really nice and
they<00:05:01.800> said<00:05:02.070> you<00:05:02.610> know<00:05:02.760> we've<00:05:02.970> designed<00:05:03.330> this

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
they said you know we've designed this

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.140 
they said you know we've designed this
gh4<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.800> with<00:05:04.950> our<00:05:04.980> own<00:05:05.190> microphone<00:05:05.550> and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
gh4 to be with our own microphone and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.580 
gh4 to be with our own microphone and
their<00:05:06.600> own<00:05:06.690> microphone<00:05:07.050> which<00:05:07.320> I've<00:05:07.470> got

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
their own microphone which I've got

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.400 
their own microphone which I've got
coming<00:05:07.830> in<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.480> review<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.970> DMW

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
coming in so I can review it is the DMW

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.230 
coming in so I can review it is the DMW
ms2<00:05:13.440> shotgun<00:05:14.250> microphone<00:05:14.700> never<00:05:14.940> used<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
ms2 shotgun microphone never used it

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.090 
ms2 shotgun microphone never used it
before<00:05:15.470> sounds<00:05:16.470> like<00:05:16.560> it's<00:05:16.710> very<00:05:16.740> similar

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
before sounds like it's very similar

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.070 
before sounds like it's very similar
looks<00:05:17.700> very<00:05:17.910> similar<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.450> this

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
looks very similar to the this

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.190 
looks very similar to the this
microphone<00:05:20.000> but<00:05:21.000> they<00:05:21.120> said<00:05:21.360> basically<00:05:21.570> it's

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
microphone but they said basically it's

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.010 
microphone but they said basically it's
the<00:05:22.500> gh4<00:05:22.740> is<00:05:23.070> based<00:05:23.970> off<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.210> tip<00:05:24.660> ring<00:05:24.840> ring

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
the gh4 is based off a tip ring ring

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.310 
the gh4 is based off a tip ring ring
sleeve<00:05:25.310> connector<00:05:26.310> whereas<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:28.170> rode

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
sleeve connector whereas the rode

videomic<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:29.070> believe<00:05:29.670> uses<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.150> just<00:05:30.390> a<00:05:30.480> tip

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
videomic I believe uses it just a tip

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.480 
videomic I believe uses it just a tip
ring<00:05:30.930> sleeve<00:05:30.990> so<00:05:31.950> there's<00:05:32.070> only<00:05:32.190> three

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
ring sleeve so there's only three

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.380 
ring sleeve so there's only three
conductors<00:05:33.180> on<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.750> actual<00:05:34.220> plug<00:05:35.220> so<00:05:36.030> it

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
conductors on the actual plug so it

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.030 
conductors on the actual plug so it
sounds<00:05:36.720> like<00:05:36.870> fun<00:05:37.050> which<00:05:37.200> panasonic<00:05:37.770> saying

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
sounds like fun which panasonic saying

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.010 
sounds like fun which panasonic saying
give<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.150> gist<00:05:39.360> of<00:05:39.480> what<00:05:39.540> their<00:05:39.780> email

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
give you the gist of what their email

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.930 
give you the gist of what their email
said<00:05:40.380> there's<00:05:41.010> basically<00:05:41.370> there's<00:05:41.640> some<00:05:41.790> sort

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
said there's basically there's some sort

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.510 
said there's basically there's some sort
of<00:05:42.000> grant<00:05:42.270> grounding<00:05:42.840> issue<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:44.220> i've<00:05:44.370> also

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
of grant grounding issue and i've also

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.130 
of grant grounding issue and i've also
talked<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.910> road<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.510> they<00:05:45.630> were<00:05:45.690> very<00:05:45.900> nice

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
talked to road and they were very nice

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.270 
talked to road and they were very nice
and<00:05:46.410> it<00:05:46.500> sounds<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:46.860> they're<00:05:46.950> going<00:05:47.040> to<00:05:47.100> send

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
and it sounds like they're going to send

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.920 
and it sounds like they're going to send
me<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.490> couple<00:05:47.670> of<00:05:47.880> different<00:05:48.150> cables<00:05:48.510> to<00:05:48.690> try

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
me a couple of different cables to try

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.240 
me a couple of different cables to try
to<00:05:50.600> basically<00:05:51.600> change<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.230> pinout<00:05:52.650> or<00:05:52.890> the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
to basically change the pinout or the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.490 
to basically change the pinout or the
the<00:05:53.490> connectors<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.870> go<00:05:55.020> into<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.320> gauge

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
the connectors that go into the gauge

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.470 
the connectors that go into the gauge
floor<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:56.100> correct<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.610> grounding<00:05:56.940> issue<00:05:57.060> so

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
floor to correct the grounding issue so

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.330 
floor to correct the grounding issue so
we'll<00:05:57.630> see<00:05:57.750> if<00:05:57.840> that<00:05:57.990> works<00:05:58.230> so<00:05:59.010> I'd<00:05:59.130> like<00:05:59.280> to

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
we'll see if that works so I'd like to

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.370 
we'll see if that works so I'd like to
keep<00:05:59.580> using<00:05:59.820> my<00:06:00.270> rode<00:06:00.450> videomic<00:06:00.900> pro<00:06:00.930> rather

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
keep using my rode videomic pro rather

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.340 
keep using my rode videomic pro rather
than<00:06:01.530> buying<00:06:01.710> another<00:06:02.040> microphone<00:06:03.170> so<00:06:04.170> this

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
than buying another microphone so this

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.470 
than buying another microphone so this
is<00:06:04.470> just<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.740> quick<00:06:04.890> test<00:06:05.190> again<00:06:05.880> this<00:06:05.970> is<00:06:06.150> not

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
is just a quick test again this is not
