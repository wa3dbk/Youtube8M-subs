00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.710 

Tector<00:00:12.340> r<00:00:12.490> is<00:00:12.580> for<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:12.790> most<00:00:13.000> part<00:00:13.210> an<00:00:13.420> open

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
Tector r is for the most part an open

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.480 
Tector r is for the most part an open
circuit<00:00:14.200> but<00:00:14.500> that<00:00:14.620> doesn't<00:00:14.950> mean<00:00:15.100> it's<00:00:15.310> easy

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
circuit but that doesn't mean it's easy

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.640 
circuit but that doesn't mean it's easy
there's<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.480> considerable<00:00:16.930> number<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.260> open

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
there's a considerable number of open

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.350 
there's a considerable number of open
sections<00:00:18.070> where<00:00:18.220> the<00:00:18.310> track<00:00:18.550> narrows<00:00:18.970> and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
sections where the track narrows and

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.000 
sections where the track narrows and
there<00:00:19.540> are<00:00:19.630> also<00:00:19.779> a<00:00:19.960> number<00:00:20.080> of<00:00:20.410> very<00:00:20.560> tricky

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
there are also a number of very tricky

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.800 
there are also a number of very tricky
corners<00:00:21.369> to<00:00:21.490> navigate

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.720 

so<00:00:26.560> let's<00:00:26.740> start<00:00:26.980> by<00:00:27.130> having<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.430> look<00:00:27.580> at<00:00:27.670> the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
so let's start by having a look at the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:01:11.700 
so let's start by having a look at the
track<00:00:28.000> on<00:00:28.180> venom<00:00:28.510> class

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.770 

and<00:01:12.549> now<00:01:12.729> take<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.090> through<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.270> whole<00:01:13.360> track

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
and now take you through the whole track

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.990 
and now take you through the whole track
step-by-step

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.150 

the<00:01:17.750> circuit<00:01:18.140> throws<00:01:18.410> you<00:01:18.560> into<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.830> tricky

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
the circuit throws you into a tricky

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.490 
the circuit throws you into a tricky
corner<00:01:19.340> series<00:01:19.820> right<00:01:20.030> from<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.360> off<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.810> quick

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
sharp right if you take a look at the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.830 
sharp right if you take a look at the
first<00:01:25.580> left-hander<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.270> can<00:01:26.390> see<00:01:26.690> it's

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
first left-hander you can see it's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.290 
first left-hander you can see it's
sloped<00:01:27.140> over<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.710> left<00:01:28.180> bearing<00:01:29.180> in<00:01:29.240> mind

that the track curves around to the
right<00:01:30.800> immediately<00:01:31.190> afterwards<00:01:31.910> it<00:01:32.330> should

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
right immediately afterwards it should

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.120 
right immediately afterwards it should
be<00:01:32.600> an<00:01:32.750> ideal<00:01:33.020> opportunity<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.830> cut<00:01:34.010> the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
be an ideal opportunity to cut the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.130 
be an ideal opportunity to cut the
corner<00:01:34.400> entirely<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.150> also<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.540> bowel<00:01:35.840> role

corner entirely and also to bowel role
in<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.380> process<00:01:37.000> it's<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.119> very<00:01:38.390> tricky

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
in the process it's a very tricky

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.630 
in the process it's a very tricky
maneuver<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.260> pull<00:01:39.440> off<00:01:39.560> though<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.250> do<00:01:40.430> need

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
maneuver to pull off though you do need

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.219 
maneuver to pull off though you do need
to<00:01:40.670> get<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.970> nose<00:01:41.150> up<00:01:41.180> at<00:01:41.479> exactly<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.080> right

remainder of this section we should need

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.020 
remainder of this section we should need
to<00:04:17.170> air<00:04:17.410> brake<00:04:17.650> at<00:04:17.830> all<00:04:18.010> just<00:04:18.460> guide<00:04:18.610> the<00:04:18.640> craft

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
to air brake at all just guide the craft

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.129 
to air brake at all just guide the craft
through<00:04:19.239> naturally

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.830 

as<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:25.610> said<00:04:25.669> earlier<00:04:25.819> at<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.210> final<00:04:26.629> right

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
as I said earlier at the final right

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.360 
as I said earlier at the final right
corner<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.259> a<00:04:27.319> lot<00:04:27.530> tighter<00:04:27.800> than<00:04:28.069> the<00:04:28.129> ones

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.070 
corner is a lot tighter than the ones
previous<00:04:28.939> so<00:04:29.389> you<00:04:29.479> need<00:04:29.629> to<00:04:29.659> be<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.840> lot<00:04:30.050> more

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
previous so you need to be a lot more

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.659 
previous so you need to be a lot more

that you have two sharp corners one
after<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.120> other<00:05:01.150> makes<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.780> very<00:05:02.020> difficult

to get a good approach to the second the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.910 
to get a good approach to the second the
key<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:04.990> approach<00:05:05.230> lies<00:05:05.560> in<00:05:05.740> how<00:05:05.860> you

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
key to this approach lies in how you

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.890 
key to this approach lies in how you
tackle<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.430> first<00:05:06.460> corner<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.540> need<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.780> keep

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
tackle the first corner you need to keep

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.660 
tackle the first corner you need to keep
the<00:05:08.050> craft<00:05:08.290> as<00:05:08.440> close<00:05:08.710> to<00:05:08.890> the<00:05:08.980> outside<00:05:09.460> wall

the craft as close to the outside wall

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.310 
the craft as close to the outside wall
as<00:05:09.850> you<00:05:09.880> can<00:05:10.210> you<00:05:10.750> should<00:05:10.930> see<00:05:11.110> there's<00:05:11.290> some

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
as you can you should see there's some

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.870 
as you can you should see there's some
white<00:05:11.650> markings<00:05:12.160> on<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.400> track<00:05:12.610> on<00:05:12.760> the

outside try to keep the craft hovering
over<00:05:15.190> these<00:05:15.340> as<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.580> go<00:05:15.700> through<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.060> corner

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
over these as you go through the corner

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.090 
over these as you go through the corner
you<00:05:16.810> need<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.050> use<00:05:17.170> a<00:05:17.200> lot<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.530> left<00:05:17.920> their

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
you need to use a lot of left their

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.970 
you need to use a lot of left their
breaking<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.670> do<00:05:18.790> this

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.400 

as<00:05:22.790> soon<00:05:23.030> as<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.270> see<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.600> right-hander<00:05:24.200> you

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
as soon as you see the right-hander you

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.380 
as soon as you see the right-hander you
immediately<00:05:24.710> need<00:05:25.160> to<00:05:25.220> left<00:05:25.550> side<00:05:25.850> shift<00:05:26.150> over

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
immediately need to left side shift over

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.540 
immediately need to left side shift over
to<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.600> inside<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.350> then<00:05:27.740> use<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.070> right<00:05:28.280> air

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
to the inside and then use the right air

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.010 
to the inside and then use the right air
freight<00:05:28.820> to<00:05:28.970> flick<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.270> craft<00:05:29.630> through<00:05:29.840> the

corner<00:05:30.460> timing<00:05:31.460> is<00:05:31.520> everything<00:05:31.700> I'm<00:05:32.090> doing

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
corner timing is everything I'm doing

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.150 
corner timing is everything I'm doing
this<00:05:32.450> it's<00:05:32.840> very<00:05:33.170> easy<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.470> hit<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.770> right<00:05:33.950> air

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
this it's very easy to hit the right air

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.190 
this it's very easy to hit the right air
brake<00:05:34.430> too<00:05:34.640> early<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.120> slam<00:05:35.450> into<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.780> apex

it successfully are your initial

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.950 
it successfully are your initial
approach<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.670> the<00:05:56.760> first<00:05:57.000> left-hander<00:05:57.750> and

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
approach to the first left-hander and

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.810 
approach to the first left-hander and
then<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.440> timing<00:05:58.920> of<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.130> right<00:05:59.310> air<00:05:59.550> brake

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820

when you take the right-hander at the
end<00:06:01.470> it<00:06:01.800> is<00:06:02.610> definitely<00:06:02.850> one<00:06:03.240> of<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.390> most

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480
