00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and there were microphone that there is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.490 
and there were microphone that there is
basically<00:01:14.640> far<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.720> believes<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> Korean

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
basically far and I believes the Korean

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
basically far and I believes the Korean
where<00:01:16.830> they've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> TV<00:01:17.700> antenna<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
where they've got a TV antenna that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.310 
where they've got a TV antenna that
comes<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
comes out of there from what I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
comes out of there from what I
understand<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.759> doesn't<00:01:21.119> nasty<00:01:21.330> disrupt

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
understand so it doesn't nasty disrupt

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
understand so it doesn't nasty disrupt
it<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.049> worry<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.970> finally

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it so don't worry about that and finally

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.300 
it so don't worry about that and finally
I<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> girl<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I was the girl for that and as you can

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.800 
I was the girl for that and as you can
see<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.210> picture<00:01:27.600> perfect<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> best<00:01:30.630> with

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
see it's picture perfect so best with

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
see it's picture perfect so best with
this<00:01:30.900> case<00:01:31.170> he<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:31.920> call<00:01:32.100> me<00:01:32.130> three<00:01:32.430> parts

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this case he does call me three parts

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
this case he does call me three parts
and<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.200> idea<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.650> case<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> he<00:01:35.070> can

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and the idea of this case that he can

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
and the idea of this case that he can
mix<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> match<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.170> I've<00:01:37.350> got

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
mix and match so as you can see I've got

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490 
mix and match so as you can see I've got
this<00:01:37.560> white<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.060> let's<00:01:39.360> say<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> want

site<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> way<00:01:49.530> back<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.100> I'll<00:01:50.700> mix

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
site and just the way back and I'll mix

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
site and just the way back and I'll mix
up<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.720> know<00:01:51.840> stops<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
up you know stops you could go and I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.450 
up you know stops you could go and I
kind<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:54.049> white<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> black<00:01:55.500> white

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
kind of like white and black white

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
kind of like white and black white
because<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.240> changes<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.469> love

a<00:01:58.619> black<00:01:58.799> back<00:01:59.070> again<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.090> I'll<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.360> show<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
a black back again so I'll just show you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
a black back again so I'll just show you
how<00:02:00.689> actually<00:02:00.930> comes<00:02:01.380> apart<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
how actually comes apart so it's a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
how actually comes apart so it's a
relatively<00:02:02.939> straightforward<00:02:03.170> all<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.560> need

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
relatively straightforward all you need

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.649 
relatively straightforward all you need
to<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> now

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to do is do it now

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.460 
to do is do it now
he's<00:02:07.380> pop<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.099> off<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.520> peer<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.319> just

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
he's pop this off for peer you can just

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.920 
he's pop this off for peer you can just
see<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.790> pulls<00:02:12.000> off

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
see there and that pulls off

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.860 
see there and that pulls off
and<00:02:13.859> then<00:02:13.950> slide<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.060> top<00:02:15.209> powder<00:02:16.040> other<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and then slide the top powder other and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.449 
and then slide the top powder other and
there's<00:02:19.079> day<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.859> itself<00:02:22.010> sunset<00:02:23.010> comes<00:02:23.310> in

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
there's day like itself sunset comes in

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.910 
there's day like itself sunset comes in
three<00:02:23.730> parts<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.469> buy<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> pink

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
three parts and you can buy a pink

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.470 
three parts and you can buy a pink
version<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.579> black<00:02:26.849> version<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.359> that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
version of that a black version of that

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.660 
version of that a black version of that
whatever<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> might<00:02:28.409> be<00:02:28.469> whatever<00:02:29.189> your<00:02:29.489> best

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
combination is and then you can mix and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.500 
combination is and then you can mix and
match<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.819> idea<00:02:32.849> with<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.269> case

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
match so I like the idea with this case

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.229 
match so I like the idea with this case
it's<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.900> very<00:02:34.109> very<00:02:34.459> cool<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.519> sleek<00:02:35.849> idea

I've found best way to install it to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.099 
I've found best way to install it to
basically<00:02:44.189> bang<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.329> first<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.810> that

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
basically bang that on first like that

just turn it over talk about this and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.270 
just turn it over talk about this and
then<00:02:52.500> slide<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.659> someone<00:02:54.659> sits<00:02:54.810> slid<00:02:55.019> in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
then slide this in someone sits slid in

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
then slide this in someone sits slid in
its<00:02:56.280> at<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.459> bottom<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.909> always<00:02:57.719> take<00:02:57.959> this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
its at the bottom I always take this

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.659 
its at the bottom I always take this
side<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.709> first<00:02:59.280> their<00:02:59.609> tack<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.629> on<00:03:00.840> first

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
side on first their tack that on first

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:11.180 
side on first their tack that on first
and<00:03:02.669> then<00:03:03.530> oops

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.700 

great<00:03:11.850> start<00:03:12.270> we'll<00:03:12.420> try<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.720> part<00:03:12.900> again<00:03:12.990> as

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
great start we'll try that part again as

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.810 
great start we'll try that part again as
you<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.250> had<00:03:14.340> enough<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.700> hold

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
you can see you had enough that hold

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.850 
you can see you had enough that hold
down<00:03:14.910> proper<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.750> basically<00:03:16.140> put<00:03:16.770> that

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
down proper so basically put that

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.780 
down proper so basically put that
stadium<00:03:17.220> first<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:19.370> make<00:03:20.370> sure<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:20.670> all

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
stadium first and make sure it's all

stadium first and make sure it's all
together<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:23.400> job<00:03:23.700> done<00:03:25.520> there<00:03:26.520> we<00:03:26.640> go<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.300> now

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
together and job done there we go so now

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.860 
together and job done there we go so now
she's<00:03:27.750> back<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:30.140> working<00:03:31.140> perfect

is it our own perfect again so once is

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.710 
is it our own perfect again so once is
on<00:04:00.890> their<00:04:01.099> income<00:04:01.370> enough<00:04:01.849> Bessie<00:04:02.360> they<00:04:02.569> can

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
on their income enough Bessie they can

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.509 
on their income enough Bessie they can
take<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.019> off<00:04:03.110> again<00:04:03.260> you've<00:04:03.500> got<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.890> prise<00:04:04.489> it

take it off again you've got to prise it
away<00:04:04.909> because<00:04:05.120> there's<00:04:05.269> two<00:04:05.420> clips<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:05.870> there

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
away because there's two clips on there

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.429 
away because there's two clips on there
so<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.700> case<00:04:07.849> itself<00:04:08.239> are<00:04:08.420> gonna<00:04:08.569> do<00:04:08.750> love<00:04:08.959> it

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
so the case itself are gonna do love it

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.069 
so the case itself are gonna do love it
the<00:04:09.829> one<00:04:09.950> thing<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.190> lot<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.879> that<00:04:10.909> it's<00:04:11.480> he

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
the one thing a lot like is that it's he

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.869 
the one thing a lot like is that it's he
does<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.650> kind<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.069> like<00:04:13.280> plasticy

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
does have that kind of like plasticy

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.910 
does have that kind of like plasticy
feel<00:04:14.060> obviously<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:14.959> made<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.290> plastic<00:04:15.379> and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
feel obviously it is made of plastic and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.800 
feel obviously it is made of plastic and
what<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.579> think<00:04:16.850> would<00:04:17.030> be<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.209> good<00:04:17.389> addition<00:04:17.539> to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
what I think would be a good addition to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.199 
what I think would be a good addition to
this<00:04:18.019> dead<00:04:18.410> kid<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:18.889> case<00:04:19.130> itself<00:04:19.549> will<00:04:20.120> be

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
this dead kid this case itself will be

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.990 
this dead kid this case itself will be
able<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> have<00:04:20.720> some<00:04:20.930> rubberized<00:04:21.380> sides<00:04:22.000> in

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
able to have some rubberized sides in

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.640 
able to have some rubberized sides in
terms<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.389> actual<00:04:23.690> usable<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.139> doesn't<00:04:24.350> affect

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
terms of actual usable it doesn't affect

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.279 
terms of actual usable it doesn't affect
it<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.010> perfect<00:04:25.490> it's<00:04:25.639> good<00:04:25.850> in<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:25.970> hand

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
it it's perfect it's good in the hand

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.330 
it it's perfect it's good in the hand
and<00:04:27.289> because<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:27.800> toughest<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.190> white

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and because it's toughest to the white

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.590 
and because it's toughest to the white
one<00:04:28.550> doesn't<00:04:28.850> pick<00:04:28.940> up<00:04:29.030> like<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.449> know<00:04:29.539> you

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
one doesn't pick up like you know you

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.540 
one doesn't pick up like you know you
can't<00:04:29.870> see<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.080> fingerprints<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:31.400> that's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
can't see the fingerprints so that's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.330 
can't see the fingerprints so that's
great<00:04:32.500> obviously<00:04:33.500> different<00:04:33.889> colors<00:04:34.160> will

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
great obviously different colors will

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.330
