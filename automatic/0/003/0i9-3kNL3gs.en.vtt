screws<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:15.189> I<00:03:17.379> have<00:03:18.379> a<00:03:18.409> I<00:03:18.709> had<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.859> small<00:03:19.159> issue

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
screws and I have a I had a small issue

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.250 
screws and I have a I had a small issue
apparently<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.209> factory<00:03:20.689> screws<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:21.170> I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
apparently the factory screws that I

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.020 
apparently the factory screws that I
pulled<00:03:21.500> out<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.950> refused<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.879> go<00:03:23.000> back

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
pulled out of this refused to go back

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.789 
pulled out of this refused to go back
into<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.569> holes<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:24.950> had<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:26.680> find<00:03:27.680> some

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
into the holes so I had to find some

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.890 
into the holes so I had to find some
other<00:03:27.889> screws<00:03:28.370> for<00:03:28.700> now<00:03:30.010> later<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:32.540> year

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
other screws for now later on this year

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.110 
other screws for now later on this year
I'll<00:03:33.109> order<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.099> screws<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.639> hope<00:03:34.819> together

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
I'll order the screws and hope together

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.420 
I'll order the screws and hope together
that<00:03:35.269> these<00:03:35.389> things<00:03:35.569> work<00:03:36.049> if<00:03:36.680> they<00:03:36.829> don't<00:03:36.859> I'm

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
that these things work if they don't I'm

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.399 
that these things work if they don't I'm
probably<00:03:37.760> gonna<00:03:37.970> have<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.359> find<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.930> new<00:03:39.109> set<00:03:39.379> of

probably gonna have to find a new set of

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.129 
probably gonna have to find a new set of
these<00:03:39.650> brackets<00:03:42.250> would<00:03:43.250> anyone
