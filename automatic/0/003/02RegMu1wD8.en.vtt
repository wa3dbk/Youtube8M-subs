this<00:02:09.050> one<00:02:09.200> has<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:09.860> says<00:02:10.069> monster

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
this one has this one says monster

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.200 
this one has this one says monster
turbine<00:02:10.729> on<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.239> if<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.110> can<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:12.410> that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
turbine on it if you can see that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.930 
turbine on it if you can see that
so<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.480> monster<00:02:13.870> turbine<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.760> real

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so it monster turbine on it the real

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910 
so it monster turbine on it the real
ones<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.360> say<00:02:16.450> monster<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.320> case<00:02:17.710> is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
ones just say monster so this case is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
ones just say monster so this case is
obviously<00:02:18.280> think<00:02:19.110> let's<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.260> get<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
obviously think let's just get the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.630 
obviously think let's just get the
headphones<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:22.080> earbuds<00:02:23.610> earbuds<00:02:24.610> that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
headphones for now earbuds earbuds that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.550 
headphones for now earbuds earbuds that
it<00:02:24.790> comes<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.510> actually<00:02:25.870> kind<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.260> close

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it comes with are actually kind of close

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.080 
it comes with are actually kind of close
they're<00:02:26.830> kind<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.070> close<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> authentic

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
they're kind of close to the authentic

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.720 
they're kind of close to the authentic
ones<00:02:28.300> as<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:29.290> they<00:02:30.010> come<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> tree

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
ones as in they come with the tree

is not sure the actual name for them but
these<00:02:38.410> actually<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.400> real<00:02:39.580> turbines<00:02:40.000> do

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
these actually do the real turbines do

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.710 
these actually do the real turbines do
come<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.630> two<00:02:40.960> different<00:02:41.740> sizes<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.280> these

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
come with two different sizes like these

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.440 
come with two different sizes like these
only<00:02:43.720> thing<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.560> regular<00:02:45.040> buds

only thing is with the regular buds

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.210 
only thing is with the regular buds

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
pairs of these which are two of these

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.700 
pairs of these which are two of these
and<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.870> ones<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.140> are<00:02:50.320> on<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:51.370> actual

headphones only thing is the real trick

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.330 
headphones only thing is the real trick
monster<00:02:56.200> turbines<00:02:56.590> come<00:02:56.920> with<00:02:57.040> three

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
monster turbines come with three

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.490 
monster turbines come with three
different<00:02:57.610> sizes<00:02:57.730> small<00:02:58.300> medium<00:02:58.330> large<00:02:58.600> you

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
different sizes small medium large you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.140 
different sizes small medium large you
tell<00:02:59.710> these<00:02:59.860> two<00:03:00.100> are<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.310> same<00:03:00.460> size<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.970> well

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
tell these two are the same size as well

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.700 
tell these two are the same size as well
as<00:03:01.360> same<00:03:01.690> size<00:03:01.870> as<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.110> ones<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.590> are<00:03:02.650> on

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
as same size as the ones that are on

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.520 
as same size as the ones that are on
there<00:03:02.860> already<00:03:04.080> another<00:03:05.080> reason<00:03:05.260> that

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
there already another reason that

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.190 
there already another reason that
they're<00:03:05.680> fake<00:03:06.390> now<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:08.020> right<00:03:08.140> here

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
they're fake now this one right here

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.070 
they're fake now this one right here
this<00:03:08.950> clip<00:03:09.570> completely<00:03:10.570> different<00:03:10.870> from<00:03:10.990> the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
this clip completely different from the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.270 
this clip completely different from the
real<00:03:11.230> one<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.650> there<00:03:11.890> has<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.070> little

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
real one this there has a little

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.640 
real one this there has a little
rotating<00:03:13.210> little<00:03:13.510> thing<00:03:13.930> year<00:03:14.260> now<00:03:14.470> it's

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
rotating little thing year now it's

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.110 
rotating little thing year now it's
completely<00:03:14.770> wrong<00:03:15.220> these<00:03:15.520> look<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.760> just

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
completely wrong these look like just

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.210 
completely wrong these look like just
something<00:03:16.630> we<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:16.990> get<00:03:17.170> off<00:03:17.320> of<00:03:17.530> out<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.040> a

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
something we can get off of out of a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.570 
something we can get off of out of a
store<00:03:19.560> for<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> cell<00:03:20.830> phone<00:03:21.010> or<00:03:21.040> something<00:03:21.280> so

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
store for a cell phone or something so

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.100 
store for a cell phone or something so
that's<00:03:21.760> obviously<00:03:21.940> thing<00:03:22.390> now<00:03:22.570> inside<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
that's obviously thing now inside the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.820 
that's obviously thing now inside the
box<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:24.270> don't<00:03:25.270> respect<00:03:25.600> I'll<00:03:26.260> suspect<00:03:26.740> that

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
box I don't respect I'll suspect that

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.620 
box I don't respect I'll suspect that
these<00:03:26.950> are<00:03:27.130> fake<00:03:27.280> just<00:03:27.490> because<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.000> they

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
these are fake just because the they

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.820 
these are fake just because the they
probably<00:03:28.840> kept<00:03:29.110> all<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.380> stuff<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.590> was<00:03:29.770> in

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
probably kept all the stuff that was in

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.260 
probably kept all the stuff that was in
there<00:03:30.070> from<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.370> monster<00:03:30.670> turbine<00:03:30.820> pros

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
there from the monster turbine pros

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.770 
there from the monster turbine pros
doubt<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:32.080> were<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.410> box<00:03:32.590> originally

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
doubt that were in the box originally

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.150 
doubt that were in the box originally
the<00:03:34.780> only<00:03:34.930> thing<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.170> think<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.410> faking<00:03:35.770> here<00:03:35.980> is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
the only thing I think is faking here is

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.590 
the only thing I think is faking here is
this<00:03:36.430> because<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.880> tried<00:03:37.060> reading<00:03:37.300> through<00:03:37.570> it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
this because I tried reading through it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.880 
this because I tried reading through it
and<00:03:37.900> some<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.290> words<00:03:38.470> aren't<00:03:38.680> even

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
and some of the words aren't even

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.170 
and some of the words aren't even
complete<00:03:39.250> some<00:03:39.520> of<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.670> words<00:03:39.820> don't<00:03:40.000> even

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
complete some of the words don't even

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.250 
complete some of the words don't even
make<00:03:40.270> sense<00:03:40.450> they<00:03:40.690> don't<00:03:40.840> make<00:03:40.930> complete

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
make sense they don't make complete

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.080 
make sense they don't make complete
sentences<00:03:41.560> it's<00:03:42.130> just<00:03:42.280> horrible<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.940> one

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
sentences it's just horrible so the one

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.700 
sentences it's just horrible so the one
I<00:03:46.330> don't<00:03:46.420> know<00:03:46.540> John<00:03:47.020> gonna<00:03:47.290> know<00:03:47.440> what<00:03:47.560> that

I don't know John gonna know what that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
is I minzy like I said this box is real

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.280 
is I minzy like I said this box is real
for<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.460> monster<00:03:51.820> turbine<00:03:52.000> pros<00:03:52.510> but<00:03:52.960> if<00:03:53.140> these
