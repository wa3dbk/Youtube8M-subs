smaller Foley metal case so it's the

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.140 
smaller Foley metal case so it's the
same<00:01:15.260> components<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.190> what<00:01:16.880> we're<00:01:17.030> shooting

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
same components and what we're shooting

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.460 
same components and what we're shooting
for<00:01:17.330> was<00:01:17.690> basically<00:01:17.990> something<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:18.320> would

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
for was basically something that would

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.109

take<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> little<00:01:18.860> less<00:01:19.100> real<00:01:19.490> estate<00:01:19.820> up<00:01:19.940> on<00:01:20.060> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
take a little less real estate up on the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.120 
take a little less real estate up on the
federal<00:01:20.330> board<00:01:20.619> but<00:01:21.619> still<00:01:21.830> give<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
federal board but still give you the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.620

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
great component so the vintage

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.300 
great component so the vintage
components<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.050> we've<00:01:24.170> used<00:01:24.380> for<00:01:24.710> all<00:01:25.190> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.010 
our mods own pedals and a for price
point<00:01:29.030> we're<00:01:29.240> really<00:01:29.450> proud<00:01:29.660> of<00:01:29.720> them<00:01:29.900> because

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
point we're really proud of them because

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.500 
point we're really proud of them because
they're<00:01:30.320> all<00:01:30.410> true<00:01:30.650> bypass<00:01:31.180> which<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.300> really

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
they're all true bypass which is really

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.420 
they're all true bypass which is really
hard<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.720> find<00:01:33.050> when<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.650> comes<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.010> price

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
hard to find when it comes to the price

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.410 
hard to find when it comes to the price

point we're going to get to here in a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.890 
point we're going to get to here in a
second<00:01:35.780> but<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.920> pedals<00:01:37.190> themselves<00:01:37.670> are

he's<00:02:26.210> at<00:02:26.300> cheesecake<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.780> kind<00:02:26.960> of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
he's at cheesecake it's kind of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.650 
he's at cheesecake it's kind of
delicious<00:02:27.260> actually<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.670> then<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.330> the

delicious actually and then the the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.140 
delicious actually and then the the
fuzzer<00:02:30.020> pedal<00:02:30.550> definitely<00:02:31.550> get<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.819> hear<00:02:32.030> that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
of like you know try to make sure that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.630 
of like you know try to make sure that
we<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.900> any<00:03:13.470> problems<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:13.890> as<00:03:14.250> far<00:03:14.430> as<00:03:14.520> like

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
we have any problems with as far as like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.920 
we have any problems with as far as like
each<00:03:14.790> Ewing<00:03:15.150> when<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.450> actually<00:03:15.570> put<00:03:15.840> them

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
each Ewing when you actually put them

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.030 
each Ewing when you actually put them
through<00:03:16.050> an<00:03:16.170> amp<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:16.530> actually<00:03:16.830> are<00:03:16.890> very

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
through an amp they actually are very

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.190 
through an amp they actually are very

that's pretty much them in a nutshell

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.870 
that's pretty much them in a nutshell
again<00:03:21.510> kind<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.960> made<00:03:22.080> for<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.350> working<00:03:22.560> man

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
again kind of made for the working man

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.300 
again kind of made for the working man
street<00:03:23.880> value<00:03:24.030> fifty<00:03:24.570> dollars<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.950> again<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
street value fifty dollars and again it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.490 
street value fifty dollars and again it
has<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.520> same<00:03:26.930> component<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.170> same

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
has the same component so the same

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.320 
has the same component so the same
circuitry<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.040> we've<00:03:29.280> done<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.910> all<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.240> our

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
circuitry that we've done for all of our

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.380 
circuitry that we've done for all of our
higher<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.960> mah<00:03:31.620> own<00:03:31.890> pedals<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.270> also

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
higher in mah own pedals and it's also

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.910 
higher in mah own pedals and it's also
kind<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.720> fun<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.080> somebody<00:03:34.470> that's<00:03:34.590> maybe

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
kind of fun for somebody that's maybe

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.550 
kind of fun for somebody that's maybe
looking<00:03:35.490> for<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:36.510> put<00:03:36.780> together<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.050> small<00:03:37.230> bore

looking for to put together a small bore
the<00:03:37.710> suing<00:03:37.920> small<00:03:38.160> gigs<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.550> just<00:03:38.820> surly

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the suing small gigs that just surly

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.430 
the suing small gigs that just surly
just<00:03:39.180> want<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.360> take<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> big<00:03:39.720> their<00:03:40.170> normal

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
just want to take a big their normal

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.740 
just want to take a big their normal
large<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.950> know<00:03:40.980> pedalboard<00:03:41.700> out<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.600> gives

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
large you know pedalboard out it gives

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.700 
large you know pedalboard out it gives
you<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> chance<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> same

something a little bit smaller that's a

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.970 
something a little bit smaller that's a
little<00:03:48.420> more<00:03:48.510> stage<00:03:48.690> friendly<00:03:49.050> well<00:03:49.830> let's

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
little more stage friendly well let's

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.230 
little more stage friendly well let's
get<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> meat<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.610> potatoes<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:51.030> this

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
get to the meat and potatoes of this

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.600 
get to the meat and potatoes of this
video<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.660> let's<00:03:51.780> hear<00:03:51.930> these<00:03:52.080> pedals<00:03:52.610> here's

our<00:03:53.790> delay<00:03:55.100> play<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:57.380> actually<00:03:58.380> it's<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.730> analog

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
our delay play is actually it's a analog

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.210 
our delay play is actually it's a analog

circuitry with a digital chip which we

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.630 
circuitry with a digital chip which we
kind<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.430> said<00:04:02.610> earlier
