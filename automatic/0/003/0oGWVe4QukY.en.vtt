00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:01.909
 school from quantitative 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.720
 methods 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720
 would be a cube 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.089
 in accordance with the accepted 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.309
 classification 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.249
 let's study the school of quantitative 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.249
 methods 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.859
 school of quantitative methods 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 or otherwise quantitative school 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:22.970
 of management 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.980
 arose as a result of rapid development 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.529
 exact sciences 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.949
 from the fifties of the twentieth century to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.689
 present tense 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.220
 methods developed by the authors of schools 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.420
 allowed to use in 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.940
 management recent achievements 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.240
 in mathematics physics and computer science 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.180
 in control theory 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.860
 representatives of this school 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.940
 are 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.460
 lawrence robert glue american 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.950
 economist 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.220
 rudolph and lumpy engineer 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.600
 theory researchers 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.510
 of management 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900
 and other scientists 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.420
 the authors paid attention to the importance 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 temporary planning 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500
 creating resource schedules and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.550
 the course of technological processes 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.370
 solving optimization problems 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.740
 particular importance 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.470
 use number of ancestors 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.560
 research acquires in complex 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.430
 situations 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.300
 requiring large array processing 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 information in time of shortage 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.140
 the essence of quantitative methods 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.600
 is that for solving problems 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.290
 enterprise management 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.760
 process model is being developed 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.430
 of management 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.760
 the model is a thematic 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.550
 simplified real display 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.960
 situations 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.150
 one of the forms of the model is 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 mathematical model 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 that is, a description of systems and processes 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.890
 loan connected math 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 expression equations 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.330
 asking various quantitative 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.290
 variable value 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.480
 can be calculated arbitrarily large 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.490
 the number of solutions to the problem and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.630
 choose the best of them 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.079
 this way the more accurately performed 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.900
 calculations 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.030
 the higher the degree of obtaining the desired 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.940
 result in a real situation 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.099
 quantitative management methods 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.709
 rely on such scientific theories as 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.559
 in theory decision making 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.049
 theory of operations operations game theory 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.039
 mass service theory 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.619
 optimal systems theory 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.619
 statistical analysis and other sciences 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.039
 note the following quote 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.359
 in the further development of the idea and methods 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.579
 quantitative directions have become so 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.689
 called synthetic teachings 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.599
 system situational and 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.489
 process is not a management approach
