00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:32.480
 I have a bit more butter than cheese here 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.580

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.040

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 I should show you how to be like one 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.520
 a scarf botnet makes one again 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:54.820
 and once and, of course, ever 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:57.420
 you know the price a bit 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.539
 now the flag against the butter 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.800

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.810
 let's sparrow our own 1 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.950
 give immediately and then over it 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.530

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.040
 Now let's stop the longest 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.780

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.600
 we let out but then stop 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:56.950

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.950

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.870
