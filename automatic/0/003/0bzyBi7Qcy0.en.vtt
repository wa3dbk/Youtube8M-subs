00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.850
 the unveiled exhaust system is the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.800
 most basic of current systems 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.750
 marketing in the community of the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.970
 father is limited to gasoline vehicles 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.970
 prior to 1993 and diesel prior to 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.970
 1997 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.200
 its design is very simple usually 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.200
 includes two or three mufflers 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.589
 systems are properly achieved 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.589
 has a number of great advantages 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 first rounds in a noise level 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.020
 exhaust gas 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.020
 before moving into the atmosphere 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.869
 second hold against the right portion of the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.360
 exhaust system and prevent the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.399
 other engine components guarantee a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.399
 maximum performance with minimum consumption 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.399
 third parties send the exhaust gases to 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.399
 outside the passenger compartment
