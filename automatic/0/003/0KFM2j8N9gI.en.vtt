mostly black and yellow but there's a
lot<00:01:42.489> of<00:01:42.519> detail<00:01:42.970> I<00:01:43.179> was<00:01:43.360> figuring<00:01:44.940> as<00:01:45.940> far<00:01:46.179> as

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
lot of detail I was figuring as far as

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300 
lot of detail I was figuring as far as
his<00:01:46.420> articulation<00:01:46.690> goes<00:01:47.200> he<00:01:47.739> virtually<00:01:47.979> has

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
his articulation goes he virtually has

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.249 
his articulation goes he virtually has
no<00:01:48.519> head<00:01:48.729> articulation<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.539> that's<00:01:50.019> mainly

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
no head articulation and that's mainly

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.219 
no head articulation and that's mainly
because<00:01:50.410> of<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.860> way<00:01:51.009> this<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:53.080> know

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
because of the way this is you know

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.639 
because of the way this is you know
sculpted<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:53.979> set<00:01:54.220> up<00:01:54.899> his<00:01:55.899> arms<00:01:56.259> go<00:01:56.410> out<00:01:56.530> to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
sculpted and set up his arms go out to

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.729 
sculpted and set up his arms go out to
the<00:01:56.739> side<00:01:56.950> no<00:01:57.399> problem<00:01:57.879> he<00:01:58.750> has<00:01:58.929> a<00:01:58.959> swivel

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
the side no problem he has a swivel

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.869 
the side no problem he has a swivel
elbow<00:02:00.369> as<00:02:01.330> well<00:02:01.599> as<00:02:01.750> elbow<00:02:02.080> hair<00:02:02.349> so<00:02:02.769> he<00:02:03.580> has<00:02:03.849> a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:03.879 
elbow as well as elbow hair so he has a

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.919 
elbow as well as elbow hair so he has a
swivel<00:02:04.599> wrist<00:02:05.909> nobody<00:02:06.909> articulation<00:02:07.569> of<00:02:07.690> this

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
swivel wrist nobody articulation of this

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.050 
swivel wrist nobody articulation of this
moves<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.649> think<00:02:09.280> that's<00:02:09.459> due<00:02:09.670> mostly<00:02:09.879> to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
moves I think that's due mostly to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.300 
moves I think that's due mostly to
sculpt<00:02:11.280> his<00:02:12.280> legs<00:02:12.550> are<00:02:12.790> able<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.180> go<00:02:13.300> out<00:02:13.480> word

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
sculpt his legs are able to go out word

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.390 
sculpt his legs are able to go out word
out<00:02:15.310> there<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.830> able<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.040> throw<00:02:18.159> up

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.309 

so<00:02:20.610> pretty<00:02:21.599> decent<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.879> he<00:02:23.879> has<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.319> single

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
so pretty decent and he has a single

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.089 
so pretty decent and he has a single
hinged<00:02:25.860> knee<00:02:26.870> with<00:02:27.870> no<00:02:28.200> articulation<00:02:28.829> that

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
hinged knee with no articulation that

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.280 
hinged knee with no articulation that
the<00:02:29.220> legs<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.879> think<00:02:30.450> that's<00:02:30.659> due<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.110> him

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the legs I think that's due to him

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.289 
the legs I think that's due to him
standing<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.370> holding<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:33.150> his

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
standing up and holding on to his

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.849 
standing up and holding on to his
