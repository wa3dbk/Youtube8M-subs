lesson of roughing the guitar with Carl

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.750 
lesson of roughing the guitar with Carl
in<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> previous<00:00:13.830> three<00:00:13.949> lessons<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.459> covered

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
in the previous three lessons we covered

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.200 
in the previous three lessons we covered
three<00:00:15.000> open<00:00:15.270> chords<00:00:15.539> G<00:00:15.779> C<00:00:16.440> indeed<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.880> lesson

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
three open chords G C indeed this lesson

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.189 
three open chords G C indeed this lesson
we're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.480> take<00:00:18.600> those<00:00:18.750> three<00:00:18.930> chords

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
we're going to take those three chords

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
we're going to take those three chords
and<00:00:19.260> put<00:00:19.440> them<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.619> progression<00:00:20.390> which<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.509> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and put them in progression which is a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
and put them in progression which is a
series<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.960> chords<00:00:22.289> moving<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:23.009> way

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
series of chords moving in some way

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.620 
series of chords moving in some way
shape<00:00:23.759> or<00:00:24.089> form<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.210> question<00:00:27.480> we're<00:00:27.599> going

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
shape or form the question we're going

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
shape or form the question we're going
to<00:00:27.749> do<00:00:27.929> is<00:00:28.140> call<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> 145<00:00:29.369> progression<00:00:29.880> that's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to do is call the 145 progression that's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.060 
to do is call the 145 progression that's
the<00:00:30.179> most<00:00:30.449> common<00:00:30.599> production<00:00:31.289> used<00:00:31.499> in<00:00:31.800> all

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the most common production used in all

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
the most common production used in all
popular<00:00:32.610> music<00:00:32.940> rock<00:00:33.150> and<00:00:33.329> roll<00:00:33.480> whatever<00:00:33.810> you

popular music rock and roll whatever you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.040 
popular music rock and roll whatever you
want<00:00:33.960> I'll<00:00:34.829> talk<00:00:35.070> about<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.400> all<00:00:35.930> it's<00:00:36.930> been

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
want I'll talk about it all it's been

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.140 
want I'll talk about it all it's been
use<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> thousand<00:00:37.680> times<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> three<00:00:38.940> codes

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
use a thousand times now the three codes

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.140 
use a thousand times now the three codes
that<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.330> did<00:00:39.540> GC<00:00:40.050> indeed<00:00:40.530> make<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.400> 145

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
that we did GC indeed make up the 145

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.740 
that we did GC indeed make up the 145
progression<00:00:42.720> in<00:00:42.960> G<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.800> reason<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.160> because

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
progression in G the reason is because

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
progression in G the reason is because
you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.080> G<00:00:46.260> Major<00:00:46.590> scale<00:00:46.770> G<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.490> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you can take the G Major scale G is the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.690 
you can take the G Major scale G is the
first<00:00:47.790> note<00:00:48.080> C<00:00:49.080> is<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> fourth<00:00:49.530> note<00:00:49.740> D<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
first note C is the fourth note D is the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.830 
first note C is the fourth note D is the
fifth<00:00:50.910> note<00:00:51.060> so<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> cause<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.720> built

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
fifth note so the cause that have built

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
fifth note so the cause that have built
on<00:00:51.990> those<00:00:52.110> three<00:00:52.350> notes<00:00:52.500> make<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.730> 145

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
on those three notes make up the 145

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.890 
on those three notes make up the 145
progression<00:00:56.240> what<00:00:57.240> I<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.630> do<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.810> you

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
progression what I want you to do is you

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.140 
progression what I want you to do is you
take<00:00:57.930> those<00:00:58.170> records<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.800> strum<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.580> very

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
take those records and strum them very

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.110 
take those records and strum them very
slowly<00:01:00.360> down<00:01:01.260> strokes<00:01:01.650> only<00:01:01.980> regular<00:01:02.910> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
slowly down strokes only regular for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
slowly down strokes only regular for
four<00:01:03.360> times<00:01:03.600> four<00:01:03.840> weeks<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> measure<00:01:05.119> Gordon

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
four times four weeks the measure Gordon

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:26.719 
four times four weeks the measure Gordon
0<00:01:06.210> gets<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> beat

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.590 

when<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.820> have<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.000> done<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.240> take<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
when you have that done you take the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.700 
when you have that done you take the
rhythm<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:28.990> can<00:01:29.140> bear<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.290> up<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.590> little

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
rhythm and you can bear it up a little

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.450 
rhythm and you can bear it up a little
bit<00:01:31.560> stead<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.590> playing<00:01:32.830> just<00:01:33.009> quarter<00:01:33.280> notes

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
bit stead of playing just quarter notes

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:49.980 
bit stead of playing just quarter notes
you<00:01:33.580> can<00:01:33.610> play<00:01:33.820> eighth<00:01:33.970> notes

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.270 

and<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.409> more<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.590> do<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:51.890> more<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.159> come

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and the more you do it the more you come

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.440 
and the more you do it the more you come
up<00:01:52.370> with<00:01:52.460> your<00:01:52.550> own<00:01:52.610> rhythms<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.120> can<00:01:53.240> get<00:01:53.360> it

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
up with your own rhythms you can get it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:12.809 
up with your own rhythms you can get it
so<00:01:53.630> my<00:01:53.780> fish

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.369 

so<00:02:13.819> practice<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.569> I'll<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> at

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
so practice that and I'll see you at

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.760 
so practice that and I'll see you at
next<00:02:15.530> lesson<00:02:15.890> take<00:02:16.579> care
