00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:24.102
Every day I wake up and ask myself "What's up today?"

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:31.918
Without thinking much about it I get ready to the world looking for the sun

00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:39.589
I just feel like this day could be alot better

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:47.050
My life is going in a second, there is nothing new today

00:00:47.050 --> 00:01:00.857
Today I just wish that this day, just for a day could stop being the same...

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:10.329
Look ahead and fear nothing, nothing is going to stop you

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:18.035
Only one step forward and I will pursue my dream until the end

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:25.694
Because when I'm with you I'm stronger and nothing will break us apart

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:34.439
Opening that door is my destiny, to walk that new path

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.402
As the waves when they come together, that's how go together

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:50.687
Beating always the same heart

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:07.925
Although we cannot touch the bird that our chest wraps

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:15.641
It's OK to leave the nest... seek those feathers

00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:23.237
And the landscape we chose after rising,

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:30.949
Should I wait until it changes or should I change it myself?

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:44.521
If only today could I fly a different sunset ...

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:54.083
Look ahead without fears, there is no reason to stop

00:02:54.083 --> 00:03:01.494
Only one step forward and I will pursue my dream until the end

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:09.538
When I'm with you I'm stronger, nothing will break us apart

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:18.008
Let's open this door and take a look at that new path

00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:25.217
If while you getting closer, we feel the same voice inside

00:03:25.217 --> 00:03:31.026
We'll go rushing on that wave.

00:03:35.877 --> 00:03:43.688
After feeling the shore, the sea's voice becomes stronger

00:03:43.688 --> 00:03:55.361
Show me a sunset that I haven't seen ... show me ...

00:03:55.361 --> 00:04:02.641
show me ...

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.704
Every day I wake up and ask myself "What's up today?"

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:34.934
Without thinking much about it I get ready to the world to find the sun
