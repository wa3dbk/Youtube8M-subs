00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
begin i can search either by basic view

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.730 
begin i can search either by basic view
power<00:00:15.960> view<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:17.190> visual<00:00:18.000> view<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.170> searching

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.890 
power view or visual view with searching
I'll<00:00:20.520> start<00:00:20.820> out<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.029> basic<00:00:21.539> that's<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
default view I have my search or my find

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.710 
default view I have my search or my find
box<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.560> I'll<00:00:26.220> type<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> word<00:00:27.980> puppy<00:00:29.720> now

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
I can search by keyword title author

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.840 
I can search by keyword title author
subject<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:36.210> series<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.129> I<00:00:38.129> could<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
subject or series and I could also have

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.840 
subject or series and I could also have
a<00:00:38.879> couple<00:00:39.300> limiters<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.320> too<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.700> i'll

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
a couple limiters in here too but i'll

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
a couple limiters in here too but i'll
just<00:00:42.030> try<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> keyword<00:00:45.800> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
just try right now with a keyword this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220 
just try right now with a keyword this
gives<00:00:47.100> me<00:00:47.190> sixty<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.030> titles<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
gives me sixty two titles that's kind of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350 
gives me sixty two titles that's kind of
a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:49.950> I'll<00:00:50.250> refine<00:00:50.760> my<00:00:51.030> search

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
a lot so I think I'll refine my search

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
a lot so I think I'll refine my search
and<00:00:52.969> i<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.180> add<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> limiter<00:00:55.020> i'm<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and i will add a limiter i'm going to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
and i will add a limiter i'm going to
choose<00:00:56.699> an<00:00:56.940> interest<00:00:57.360> level<00:00:57.890> from<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
choose an interest level from a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.150 
choose an interest level from a
kindergarten<00:00:59.730> student<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.930> through<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> 3rd

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
kindergarten student up through a 3rd

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.539 
kindergarten student up through a 3rd
grade<00:01:02.489> student<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.290> now<00:01:04.290> i'll<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.979> search

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.710 

that's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.670> little<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:09.000> better<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.390> gives<00:01:09.600> me

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that's a little bit better it gives me

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740 
that's a little bit better it gives me
only<00:01:09.900> eight<00:01:10.260> titles<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.330> scroll<00:01:12.689> down

I can see if the books available how

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.740 
I can see if the books available how
many<00:01:17.759> copies<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:20.240> if<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> wanted<00:01:21.630> to

find out more i could click on the title
and<00:01:26.689> i<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.759> short<00:01:29.759> description<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and i would get a short description of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.840 
and i would get a short description of
it<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:32.329> can<00:01:33.329> use<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> breadcrumbs<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.560> back

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
it I can use the breadcrumbs to go back

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.560 
it I can use the breadcrumbs to go back
and<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> call<00:01:39.150> number<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and I can see what the call number is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.330 
and I can see what the call number is
and<00:01:40.400> search<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> library<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:43.340> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and search for it in the library or I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.010 
and search for it in the library or I
could<00:01:44.610> add<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.180> list<00:01:45.530> for<00:01:46.530> checkout<00:01:47.009> and

could add it to my list for checkout and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
could add it to my list for checkout and
that's<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.290> basic<00:01:49.799> search<00:01:50.130> i'm<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> use

that's the basic search i'm going to use

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's the basic search i'm going to use
the<00:01:50.939> breadcrumbs<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.820> try<00:01:53.820> a
