the<00:01:35.229> time<00:01:35.470> really<00:01:35.799> that<00:01:35.950> was<00:01:36.070> gonna<00:01:36.220> give<00:01:36.460> him

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
the time really that was gonna give him

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.430 
the time really that was gonna give him
a<00:01:36.670> bit<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.880> momentum<00:01:37.030> any<00:01:37.539> it<00:01:38.020> certainly

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
a bit of momentum any it certainly

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.930 
a bit of momentum any it certainly
appeared<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.069> way<00:01:39.250> even<00:01:39.490> though<00:01:39.729> he<00:01:39.819> has

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
appeared that way even though he has

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.609 
appeared that way even though he has

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
made a few errors along the way

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.050 
made a few errors along the way
absolutely<00:01:42.369> I<00:01:42.490> couldn't<00:01:42.729> agree<00:01:42.819> with<00:01:42.940> him

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
absolutely I couldn't agree with him

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.550 
absolutely I couldn't agree with him
more<00:01:43.149> but<00:01:43.420> what<00:01:43.569> a<00:01:43.600> science<00:01:44.049> about<00:01:44.289> your<00:01:44.440> high

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560
