00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
honestly this goth kind of surprised me

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.240 
honestly this goth kind of surprised me
because<00:05:55.540> I<00:05:55.750> thought<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.170> would<00:05:56.560> have<00:05:56.710> smell<00:05:57.070> as

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
because I thought it would have smell as

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.310 
because I thought it would have smell as
good<00:05:57.280> as<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.730> does<00:05:57.880> but<00:05:58.390> it<00:05:58.510> smells<00:05:58.870> really

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
good as it does but it smells really

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.350 
good as it does but it smells really
good<00:05:59.620> and<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.490> thought<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:00.820> color<00:06:01.030> would<00:06:01.240> be

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
good and I thought the color would be

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.420 
good and I thought the color would be
more<00:06:01.540> vibrant<00:06:02.050> but<00:06:02.200> it<00:06:02.350> couldn't<00:06:02.800> be<00:06:03.010> because

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
more vibrant but it couldn't be because

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.570 
more vibrant but it couldn't be because
my<00:06:04.180> stuff<00:06:04.870> is<00:06:05.110> discolored<00:06:05.800> because<00:06:05.920> when<00:06:06.550> I

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
my stuff is discolored because when I

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.040 
my stuff is discolored because when I
think<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:06.880> bubble<00:06:07.150> bars<00:06:07.390> in<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.720> bathroom

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
think the bubble bars in the bathroom

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.470 
think the bubble bars in the bathroom
off<00:06:08.140> because<00:06:08.650> those<00:06:08.800> guards<00:06:09.370> for<00:06:09.970> some<00:06:10.150> reason

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
off because those guards for some reason

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.750 
off because those guards for some reason
