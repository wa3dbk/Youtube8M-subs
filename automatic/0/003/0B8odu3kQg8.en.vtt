 his radio radiation and thus also the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.830
 be limited 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.810
 You either choose a smaller one 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.900
 transmitting power or you activate the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.600
 so-called radiation-free setting 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.110
 It switches the radio radiation 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.030
 contact lenses are in readiness 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.610
 it takes about used game time 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.799
 simply the ringtones are so-called 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.600
 red zone and it should be under the 23 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.200
 can do something suitable for everyone 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.210
 his 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170
 everything is like everyone else 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.250
 android market 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.900
 also set a vibration alarm 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.660
 can be switched on 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.630
 the voice quality of the sn 39 is right 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.640
 Of course, the handsfree mode has one 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.250
 rich reproduction in stark contrast 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.800
 To many other phone here cheaper 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.580
 Once again its about technology 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 can degrade 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.989
 for him is beyond the landline too 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.400
 the internet for disposal thus works 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.400
 then also skype or facebook 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.350
 unfortunately not phone israel 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.970
 possible 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.850
 also the popular babyphone is missing 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.370
 Function to the technique one can say it 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.319
 runs with android 4.0 point 4 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.819
 this one speaks that they are quite pretty 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.430
 can use new apps 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.630
 but this is not automatically so because 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.180
 the hardware is compared with 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.030
 smartphones are pretty weak inside 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.049
 there is a processor with 996 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.890
 ghz him but only 384 megabytes 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.720
 Memory for the data to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.310
 to be available 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.410
 disturb there is already the gigaset 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.590
 some smartphone typical sensors and 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.959
 functions are missing no gps module for the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.670
 location by wlan worked the place 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.859
 also not in the test device 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.790
 So all the apps were location based 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.519
 useless 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.470
 a gyro sensor for games no 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.480
 bluetooth chip for handsfree and 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.870
 data transfer functions and none 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.910
 camera 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.980
 So are also video calls over 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.340
 Skype or other telephone techniques 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.190
 not possible the display has a 320 x 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.420
 480 pixel resolution and a 3.2 inches 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.430
 touch display 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.459
 the battery life is loud gigaset 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.569
 up to 140 hours 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.130
 our conclusion for the gigaset sl 930 a 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.840
 The Gigaset is a solid house phone 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.000
 its functions are down to the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.620
 Missing baby monitor mode quite good in 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.720
 the android world will establish 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 It brings a lot of android function 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.950
 from the smartphone world with im direct 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.819
 However, it can be compared with smartphones 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.500
 do not keep up 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.390
 too many gigaset are missing 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.359
 features in this price range 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.760
 smartphones are of course 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.440
 the new gigaset changes it 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.860
 30a is both in the net so at 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.850
 various suppliers from 169 to 207 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.130
 to get euro 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.960
 We can definitely say the time 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.760
 is long overdue for such a phone 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.730
 been 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.300
 for the aesthetic gigaset sl 930 against 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.300
 we are a shopping tip
