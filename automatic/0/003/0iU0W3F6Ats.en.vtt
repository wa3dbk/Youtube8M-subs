about<00:00:15.630> optimizing<00:00:16.470> windows<00:00:17.119> specifically

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
about optimizing windows specifically

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.510 
about optimizing windows specifically
windows<00:00:18.449> XP<00:00:18.980> today<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.340> talking

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
windows XP today I'm going to be talking

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.439 
windows XP today I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:21.350> defragmentation<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
about defragmentation so you have a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.439 
about defragmentation so you have a
Windows<00:00:24.750> Defragmenter<00:00:26.029> when<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> install

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
Windows Defragmenter when you install

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
Windows Defragmenter when you install
windows<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.320> accessories<00:00:28.920> system

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
windows it's in your accessories system

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
windows it's in your accessories system
tools<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.740> good<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.250> i'm

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
tools but that's not very good so i'm

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
tools but that's not very good so i'm
going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> show<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.329> defrag<00:00:34.079> mentors<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
going to show you to defrag mentors that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.979 
going to show you to defrag mentors that
i<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.890> recommend<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> links<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.870> in

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
i would recommend so the links are in

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
i would recommend so the links are in
the<00:00:37.020> description<00:00:37.079> once<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.950> download<00:00:38.280> them

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the description once you download them

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
the description once you download them
you'll<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.790> these<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.120> files<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> first

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you'll have these two files so the first

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.500 
you'll have these two files so the first
one<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.250> install<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.000> ultimate

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
one I'm going to install is ultimate

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.709 
one I'm going to install is ultimate
defrag<00:00:43.370> it's<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> freeware<00:00:44.760> program<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
defrag it's a freeware program and this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
defrag it's a freeware program and this
is<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.230> strong<00:00:46.649> defrag<00:00:47.219> ER<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> can

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
is a very strong defrag ER so you can

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
is a very strong defrag ER so you can
run<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.449> once<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.960> week<00:00:51.989> once<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.469> month

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
run this like once a week once a month

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
run this like once a week once a month
depending<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.399> how<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.850> use<00:00:53.879> your

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
depending on how much you use your

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.520 
depending on how much you use your
computer

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.590 

so<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.680> boot<00:00:58.920> optimizer<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.730> defragment

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so this boot optimizer will defragment

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.980 
so this boot optimizer will defragment
your<00:01:00.690> booting<00:01:01.460> your<00:01:02.460> boot<00:01:02.700> sector<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
your booting your boot sector and that

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.650 
your booting your boot sector and that
will<00:01:04.110> make<00:01:04.230> you<00:01:04.410> boot<00:01:04.620> up<00:01:04.710> faster<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:06.330> can

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
will make you boot up faster so you can

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.610 
will make you boot up faster so you can
do<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:09.990> also<00:01:10.200> make<00:01:10.440> your

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
do this and you can also make your

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.030 
do this and you can also make your
default<00:01:11.040> defragmenter<00:01:11.880> which<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> fine<00:01:13.040> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
default defragmenter which is fine so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.450 
default defragmenter which is fine so
you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.370> run<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.900> analysis<00:01:16.100> which<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.280> tell

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you can run a analysis which will tell

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.390 
you can run a analysis which will tell
you<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> need<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> defrag<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.160> this<00:01:20.160> graph

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you if you need to defrag and this graph

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.790 
you if you need to defrag and this graph
here<00:01:20.670> basically<00:01:20.910> shows<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.990> system<00:01:22.500> then

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
here basically shows your system then

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.150 
here basically shows your system then
your<00:01:23.580> system<00:01:23.970> files<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.979> application<00:01:25.979> game

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
your system files and application game

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.340 
your system files and application game
files<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.720> they're<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.110> close

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
files so if they're not all close

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
files so if they're not all close
together<00:01:28.759> it'll<00:01:29.759> mean<00:01:30.000> need<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.450> be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
together it'll mean need to be

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
together it'll mean need to be
defragmented<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.360> once

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
defragmented which this one does so once

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.030 
defragmented which this one does so once
the<00:01:33.750> analysis<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> done<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.800> can<00:01:34.830> defragment

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
the analysis is done you can defragment

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
the analysis is done you can defragment
and<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:39.180> could<00:01:39.390> take<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> while<00:01:39.690> depending<00:01:39.840> on

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and this could take a while depending on

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.650 
and this could take a while depending on
the<00:01:40.560> size<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.040> hard<00:01:41.280> drive<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.420> usually

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
the size of your hard drive but usually

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.540 
the size of your hard drive but usually
might<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.470> 10<00:01:43.800> minutes<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.250> half<00:01:44.460> an

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
might take about 10 minutes to half an

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.139 
might take about 10 minutes to half an
hour<00:01:45.890> if<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.040> any<00:01:47.130> reason<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> pause

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
hour if for any reason you need to pause

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.630 
hour if for any reason you need to pause
it<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> pause<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:49.860> stop<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.520> it's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it you can pause it here or stop it it's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.560 
it you can pause it here or stop it it's
not<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> harm<00:01:51.810> anything<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> that's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
not going to harm anything so that's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.920 
not going to harm anything so that's
basically<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.259> defrag<00:01:56.160> ran<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.930> there's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
basically the defrag ran out there's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.190 
basically the defrag ran out there's
another<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.470> called<00:01:58.700> j/k<00:01:59.700> defrag<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.569> this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
another one called j/k defrag and this

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469 
another one called j/k defrag and this
one<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.709> will<00:02:01.950> defragment<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:03.330> your

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
one here will defragment when your

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.150 
one here will defragment when your
screensaver<00:02:03.810> goes<00:02:04.319> on<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.270> extract

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.730 

now<00:02:11.160> you're<00:02:11.880> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.240> these<00:02:13.110> four<00:02:13.500> files

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
now you're going to get these four files

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.170 
now you're going to get these four files
here<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> you're<00:02:17.490> going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> want<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.880> take<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
here so you're going to want to take the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.030 
here so you're going to want to take the
screensaver<00:02:18.510> file<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.410> will<00:02:19.500> be<00:02:19.590> two<00:02:19.800> that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
screensaver file there will be two that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.160 
screensaver file there will be two that
will<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.220> called<00:02:20.400> screensaver<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.930> want

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
will be called screensaver so you want
