00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.010 

and<00:04:27.340> I'm<00:04:28.340> actually<00:04:28.700> blending<00:04:29.180> my<00:04:29.360> concealer

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
and I'm actually blending my concealer

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.810 
and I'm actually blending my concealer
with<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.290> Real<00:04:30.470> Techniques<00:04:30.650> crease<00:04:31.580> brush

with the Real Techniques crease brush

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.280 
with the Real Techniques crease brush
because<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.390> one's<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.690> little<00:04:32.780> more<00:04:32.930> dense

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
because this one's a little more dense

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.260 
because this one's a little more dense
so<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.560> find<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:33.980> lot<00:04:34.130> nicer<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.550> blend<00:04:35.090> with
