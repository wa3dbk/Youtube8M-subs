blade has a shaft that goes right

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.599 
blade has a shaft that goes right
through<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.840> does<00:01:18.049> two<00:01:18.259> little<00:01:18.500> holes<00:01:18.680> has

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
through it so does two little holes has

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.190 
through it so does two little holes has
two<00:01:19.820> little<00:01:19.939> screws<00:01:20.359> it<00:01:20.570> has<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.840> catch<00:01:21.020> in

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
two little screws it has to catch in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.370 
two little screws it has to catch in
those<00:01:21.350> holes<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:23.270> problem<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.780> haven't

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
those holes and the problem and haven't

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.499 
those holes and the problem and haven't
is<00:01:24.530> because<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:26.719> wink<00:01:27.039> catches<00:01:28.039> up<00:01:28.219> to<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
is because the wink catches up to it the

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.539 
is because the wink catches up to it the
Blake<00:01:29.719> strikes<00:01:30.109> even<00:01:30.350> though<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.649> did<00:01:31.399> the

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
Blake strikes even though I did the

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.599 
Blake strikes even though I did the
trick<00:01:31.850> flip<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.350> blades<00:01:33.590> over<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.219> it<00:01:34.310> can<00:01:34.460> be

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
trick flip the blades over so it can be

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.120 
trick flip the blades over so it can be
further<00:01:34.939> apart<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:36.469> you<00:01:36.590> can<00:01:36.740> see<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:36.920> got

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
further apart and you can see I got

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.130 
further apart and you can see I got
grass<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.789> trees<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.270> stuff<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.630> catches<00:01:38.990> on

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
grass and trees and stuff it catches on

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.160 
grass and trees and stuff it catches on
