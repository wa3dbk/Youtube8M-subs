toy<00:00:15.999> he's<00:00:16.999> just<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.390> redeco<00:00:17.779> of<00:00:17.810> side<00:00:18.710> soy<00:00:18.919> but<00:00:19.099> I

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
toy he's just a redeco of side soy but I

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.279 
toy he's just a redeco of side soy but I
didn't<00:00:19.369> want<00:00:19.429> to<00:00:19.550> do<00:00:19.730> that<00:00:19.759> and<00:00:20.269> actually<00:00:21.079> I

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
didn't want to do that and actually I

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.319 
didn't want to do that and actually I
kind<00:00:21.499> of<00:00:21.560> improved<00:00:22.039> on<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.640> design<00:00:22.939> so<00:00:23.150> he's

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
kind of improved on the design so he's

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.779 
kind of improved on the design so he's
kind<00:00:23.689> of<00:00:23.839> a<00:00:23.989> Ferrari<00:00:24.829> but<00:00:25.039> not<00:00:25.220> really<00:00:25.460> he's<00:00:25.699> a

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
kind of a Ferrari but not really he's a

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.189 
kind of a Ferrari but not really he's a
little<00:00:25.939> higher<00:00:26.179> up<00:00:26.210> if<00:00:26.599> you<00:00:26.720> remember<00:00:27.019> my

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
little higher up if you remember my

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.130 
little higher up if you remember my
sideswipe<00:00:27.739> he's<00:00:27.980> more<00:00:28.220> sloped<00:00:28.609> down<00:00:29.019> so<00:00:30.019> this

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
sideswipe he's more sloped down so this

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.069 
sideswipe he's more sloped down so this
is<00:00:30.289> a<00:00:30.319> kind<00:00:30.649> of<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:31.119> similar<00:00:32.119> transformation<00:00:32.509> by

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
is a kind of a similar transformation by

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.240 
is a kind of a similar transformation by
new<00:00:33.260> twist<00:00:33.590> this<00:00:34.070> is<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.340> sleeker<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:36.250> we'll

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
new twist this is a sleeker and we'll

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.130 
new twist this is a sleeker and we'll
say<00:00:37.519> in<00:00:37.940> robot<00:00:38.329> mode<00:00:38.359> he<00:00:38.809> is<00:00:38.899> definitely

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
say in robot mode he is definitely

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.990 
say in robot mode he is definitely
different<00:00:39.590> looking<00:00:40.039> you<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:40.609> see<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:40.789> kind<00:00:40.969> of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
different looking you can see I kind of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.619 
different looking you can see I kind of
made<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.269> detail<00:00:41.629> red<00:00:41.870> stripe<00:00:42.199> down<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.530> side

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
made the detail red stripe down the side

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.029 
made the detail red stripe down the side
the<00:00:44.629> front<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:44.989> different<00:00:45.410> than<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.920> other

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
the front is different than the other

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.549 
the front is different than the other
ones<00:00:46.280> tilted<00:00:46.820> down<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:47.839> not<00:00:48.050> supposed<00:00:48.469> to

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
ones tilted down so it's not supposed to

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.560 
ones tilted down so it's not supposed to
be<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.739> Lamborghini<00:00:49.280> like<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.699> original<00:00:50.120> g1

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
be a Lamborghini like the original g1

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.069 
be a Lamborghini like the original g1
toy<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.820> let's<00:00:52.820> get<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.149> transformation<00:00:53.960> oh

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
toy so let's get to transformation oh

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.389 
toy so let's get to transformation oh
and<00:00:54.289> you<00:00:54.379> can<00:00:54.469> see<00:00:54.649> I<00:00:54.679> changed<00:00:55.070> also<00:00:55.219> the

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
and you can see I changed also the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.729 
and you can see I changed also the
weapons<00:00:55.699> I'll<00:00:55.789> bring<00:00:55.999> in<00:00:56.199> my<00:00:57.199> sideswipe

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
weapons I'll bring in my sideswipe

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.860 
weapons I'll bring in my sideswipe
design<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.789> second<00:00:59.210> when<00:00:59.510> i<00:00:59.570> get<00:00:59.780> i'm

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
design in a second when i get i'm

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.549 
design in a second when i get i'm
transferring<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.409> robot<00:01:00.679> mode<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.370> similar<00:01:02.559> we

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
transferring to robot mode so similar we

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.880 
transferring to robot mode so similar we
want<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.920> flip<00:01:04.430> out<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.850> legs<00:01:05.060> like<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.080> like

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
want to flip out the legs like so like

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.850 
want to flip out the legs like so like
most<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.340> my<00:01:07.370> lego<00:01:07.640> formers<00:01:08.530> let's<00:01:09.530> get<00:01:09.770> them

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
most of my lego formers let's get them

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.350 
most of my lego formers let's get them
to<00:01:09.980> a<00:01:10.010> static<00:01:10.430> position<00:01:15.220> ok<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.820> i<00:01:16.910> did<00:01:17.210> make

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
to a static position ok and i did make

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.910 
to a static position ok and i did make
it<00:01:17.480> more<00:01:17.630> sleek<00:01:17.900> ruiz<00:01:18.110> about<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.410> couple<00:01:18.890> of

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
it more sleek ruiz about a couple of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.340 
it more sleek ruiz about a couple of
bricks<00:01:19.070> tall<00:01:19.400> shorter<00:01:20.060> i<00:01:20.090> guess<00:01:20.330> then<00:01:20.570> then

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
bricks tall shorter i guess then then

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.460 
bricks tall shorter i guess then then
sideswipe<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.400> want<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.610> pull<00:01:22.790> out<00:01:23.470> these

side<00:01:24.830> panels<00:01:25.070> which<00:01:25.370> become<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.730> arms<00:01:26.920> flip

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
side panels which become the arms flip

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.670 
side panels which become the arms flip
up<00:01:28.160> this<00:01:28.730> section<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:29.830> clip<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.980> into<00:01:31.100> place

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
up this section here clip it into place

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.210 
up this section here clip it into place
ok<00:01:33.680> then<00:01:34.840> different<00:01:35.840> than<00:01:35.870> before<00:01:38.830> well<00:01:39.830> this

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
ok then different than before well this

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.290 
ok then different than before well this
is<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.370> little<00:01:40.610> bit<00:01:40.730> different<00:01:41.090> snyder

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
is a little bit different snyder

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.690 
is a little bit different snyder
actually<00:01:41.720> joints<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.230> old<00:01:42.440> school<00:01:42.620> joints<00:01:43.160> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
actually joints to old school joints the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.170 
actually joints to old school joints the
head<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.270> now<00:01:44.540> on<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.870> little<00:01:45.350> t.t<00:01:46.250> piece<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
head is now on a little t.t piece and

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.450 
head is now on a little t.t piece and
you<00:01:47.570> turn<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.900> around<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.410> then<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.920> pop<00:01:49.280> out

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
you turn it around and then you pop out

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.560 
you turn it around and then you pop out
the<00:01:49.870> antenna<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:51.410> however<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.830> like<00:01:52.280> like<00:01:53.030> so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
the antenna to however you like like so

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.430 
the antenna to however you like like so
and<00:01:53.990> he<00:01:54.800> has<00:01:54.980> cool<00:01:55.760> full<00:01:56.330> articulation<00:01:56.780> here

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
and he has cool full articulation here

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.200 
and he has cool full articulation here
which<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.310> an<00:01:58.460> improvement<00:01:58.550> over<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.090> last

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
which is an improvement over the last

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.900 
which is an improvement over the last
version<00:01:59.690> you<00:02:00.650> want<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.010> bring<00:02:01.370> up<00:02:01.550> the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
version you want to then bring up the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.050 
version you want to then bring up the
arms<00:02:02.390> similar<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.290> other<00:02:03.370> version<00:02:04.370> and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
arms similar to the other version and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.540 
arms similar to the other version and
some<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.810> my<00:02:05.840> other<00:02:06.170> transformers<00:02:06.800> like<00:02:07.520> a

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
a lot cooler he's a little more

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.630 
a lot cooler he's a little more
streamlined<00:02:50.430> close<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> head<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.489> yeah

let<00:02:54.819> me<00:02:54.910> bring<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.500> sideswipe<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:56.769> size

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
let me bring in sideswipe for size

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.120 
let me bring in sideswipe for size
comparison<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.590> we'll<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.739> move<00:02:59.950> him

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
comparison here so we'll just move him

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.289 
comparison here so we'll just move him
over<00:03:00.280> I'm<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:00.970> see<00:03:01.060> he's<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.209> little

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
over I'm going to see he's a little

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.160 
over I'm going to see he's a little
shorter<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.959> he's<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.080> lot<00:03:02.350> sleeker<00:03:02.769> so

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
shorter and he's a lot sleeker so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.830 
shorter and he's a lot sleeker so
there's<00:03:05.170> sideswipe<00:03:05.790> much<00:03:06.790> bigger<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.660> see

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
there's sideswipe much bigger it can see

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.170 
there's sideswipe much bigger it can see
his<00:03:07.930> big<00:03:08.620> under<00:03:09.040> proportion<00:03:09.580> arms<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.060> I'm

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
his big under proportion arms so I'm

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.360 
his big under proportion arms so I'm
probably<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.750> go<00:03:10.870> back<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.380> change<00:03:12.069> up

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
probably going to go back and change up

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
probably going to go back and change up
to<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:12.730> version<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:13.780> we'll<00:03:13.959> see<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.530> anyway

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
to this version but we'll see but anyway

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.789 
to this version but we'll see but anyway
I'll<00:03:16.390> get<00:03:16.540> him<00:03:16.660> out<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.049> spotlight<00:03:17.350> for<00:03:17.769> a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
I'll get him out of the spotlight for a

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.220 
I'll get him out of the spotlight for a
second<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.090> figure<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.870> figure

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
second so I figure this figure

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.110 
second so I figure this figure
definitely<00:03:20.859> i<00:03:21.100> feels<00:03:21.700> more<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.000> proportion

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
definitely i feels more in proportion

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.259 
definitely i feels more in proportion
and<00:03:23.010> overall<00:03:24.010> i<00:03:24.220> am<00:03:24.280> very<00:03:24.609> happy<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.000> this

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
and overall i am very happy with this

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.090 
and overall i am very happy with this
