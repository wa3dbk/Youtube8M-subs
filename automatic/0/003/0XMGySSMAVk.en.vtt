00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
process so that way you're inspecting it

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.679 
process so that way you're inspecting it
to<00:02:17.739> see<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.280> sheds<00:02:18.579> and<00:02:18.849> if<00:02:18.939> it<00:02:19.150> does<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
to see if it sheds and if it does that

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.199 
to see if it sheds and if it does that
is<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.349> time<00:02:20.590> where<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.069> would<00:02:21.220> notify<00:02:21.549> onic

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
is the time where you would notify onic

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.020 
is the time where you would notify onic
but<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.500> does<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:23.950> shed<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.579> it<00:02:24.730> sheds

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
but if it does not shed and it sheds

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.970 
but if it does not shed and it sheds
thereafter<00:02:25.599> anything<00:02:26.439> that<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.799> do

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
thereafter anything that you do

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.460 
thereafter anything that you do
thereafter<00:02:27.459> has<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.360> with<00:02:28.540> whatever<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
to be real careful with the installation

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.869 
to be real careful with the installation
of<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.109> because<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.069> well<00:02:36.310> made<00:02:36.579> and

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
of that because it's so well made and

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.630 
of that because it's so well made and
it's<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.239> meticulously<00:02:37.989> crafted<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:39.220> want<00:02:39.519> to
