00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.220 

let's<00:00:08.230> create<00:00:08.500> a<00:00:08.590> custom<00:00:08.680> tool<00:00:09.220> shelf<00:00:10.230> having

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
let's create a custom tool shelf having

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.310 
let's create a custom tool shelf having
shelves<00:00:11.799> allows<00:00:12.670> you<00:00:12.969> to<00:00:13.180> set<00:00:13.389> up<00:00:13.420> a<00:00:13.600> tab<00:00:13.930> right

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
shelves allows you to set up a tab right

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.660 
shelves allows you to set up a tab right
here

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
here

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.390 
here
most<00:00:16.059> commonly<00:00:16.720> used<00:00:16.990> functions<00:00:17.470> inside<00:00:18.130> Maya

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
most commonly used functions inside Maya

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.080 
most commonly used functions inside Maya
so<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:20.260> do<00:00:20.500> have<00:00:20.710> by<00:00:21.070> default<00:00:21.580> we<00:00:21.760> have<00:00:21.790> some

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
so we do have by default we have some

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.750 
so we do have by default we have some
polygon<00:00:22.540> tool<00:00:22.750> shells<00:00:23.020> that<00:00:23.230> we<00:00:23.350> can<00:00:23.500> use<00:00:23.760> but

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
polygon tool shells that we can use but

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.000 
polygon tool shells that we can use but
oftentimes<00:00:25.119> this<00:00:25.689> is<00:00:25.840> not<00:00:26.020> enough<00:00:26.260> or<00:00:26.529> is<00:00:26.740> just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
oftentimes this is not enough or is just

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.870 
oftentimes this is not enough or is just
not<00:00:27.490> what<00:00:27.939> we<00:00:28.119> need<00:00:28.860> so<00:00:29.860> we<00:00:30.189> can<00:00:30.369> set<00:00:30.580> up<00:00:30.700> our

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
not what we need so we can set up our

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.170 
not what we need so we can set up our
custom<00:00:31.420> one<00:00:31.599> by<00:00:32.500> going<00:00:32.860> up<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.010> on<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:34.000> left

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
custom one by going up to on the left

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.990 
custom one by going up to on the left
hand<00:00:34.300> side<00:00:34.510> here<00:00:35.190> click<00:00:36.190> down<00:00:36.400> on<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:36.730> arrow

and<00:00:37.300> go<00:00:38.110> under<00:00:38.440> shelf<00:00:38.830> editor<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:41.290> we<00:00:41.470> can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
and go under shelf editor here we can

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.530 
and go under shelf editor here we can
create<00:00:41.860> new<00:00:42.129> shelves<00:00:42.489> we<00:00:42.640> can<00:00:42.760> edit<00:00:42.970> shelves

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
create new shelves we can edit shelves

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.110 
create new shelves we can edit shelves
we<00:00:44.530> can<00:00:44.710> rename<00:00:45.070> shelves<00:00:45.580> we<00:00:45.730> can<00:00:45.850> delete

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
we can rename shelves we can delete

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.590 
we can rename shelves we can delete
shells<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.290> on<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.269> create<00:00:49.510> a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
shells and and so on so we can create a

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.719 
shells and and so on so we can create a
new<00:00:49.870> shelf<00:00:50.140> from<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:50.920> menu<00:00:51.220> from<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.460> shelf

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
new shelf from this menu from the shelf

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.060 
new shelf from this menu from the shelf
editor<00:00:52.120> by<00:00:52.870> clicking<00:00:52.900> on<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.500> new<00:00:53.589> shelf<00:00:53.830> or

editor by clicking on the new shelf or

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.000 
editor by clicking on the new shelf or
we<00:00:54.489> can<00:00:54.610> also<00:00:54.760> use<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.930> new<00:00:56.049> shelf<00:00:56.320> icon<00:00:56.799> right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
we can also use the new shelf icon right

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.890 
we can also use the new shelf icon right
here<00:00:57.040> so<00:00:57.760> let's<00:00:57.940> do<00:00:58.089> that<00:00:58.239> now<00:00:58.479> create<00:00:58.870> new

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
here so let's do that now create new

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.979 
here so let's do that now create new

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
back to the shelf editor and let's take

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.120 
back to the shelf editor and let's take
our<00:01:22.420> game<00:01:22.689> environment<00:01:23.229> model<00:01:23.619> in<00:01:23.710> here<00:01:23.979> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
our game environment model in here and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.520 
our game environment model in here and
let's<00:01:24.670> just<00:01:24.729> click<00:01:25.030> on<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.420> move<00:01:25.990> up<00:01:26.140> icon

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
let's just click on this move up icon

also<00:01:29.289> going<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> rename<00:01:30.189> it<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.850> modeling<00:01:31.240> and

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
also going to rename it to modeling and

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.380 
also going to rename it to modeling and
then<00:01:31.929> we<00:01:32.049> can<00:01:32.200> save<00:01:32.560> all<00:01:32.799> shelves<00:01:33.219> and<00:01:33.369> now<00:01:34.329> we

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
then we can save all shelves and now we

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.209 
then we can save all shelves and now we
have<00:01:34.689> our<00:01:34.960> game<00:01:35.350> environment<00:01:35.829> model<00:01:36.100> and

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
have our game environment model and

have our game environment model and
shelf<00:01:36.399> right<00:01:36.579> up<00:01:36.789> on<00:01:36.939> top<00:01:37.119> here<00:01:37.719> we<00:01:37.929> can<00:01:38.079> start

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
shelf right up on top here we can start

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.310 
shelf right up on top here we can start
adding<00:01:38.560> our<00:01:38.859> most<00:01:39.340> used<00:01:39.939> functions<00:01:40.359> that<00:01:41.109> we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
adding our most used functions that we

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.349 
adding our most used functions that we
will<00:01:41.619> be<00:01:41.740> using<00:01:42.100> inside<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.939> model<00:01:43.240> our

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
will be using inside to model our

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.480 
will be using inside to model our
environments<00:01:43.899> we<00:01:44.619> can<00:01:44.770> also<00:01:44.890> delete<00:01:45.280> some<00:01:45.460> of

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.730 
let's add them to our custom shelf so
first<00:02:04.119> make<00:02:04.390> sure<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.170> are<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
first make sure that you are on the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.370 
first make sure that you are on the
polygons<00:02:06.249> if<00:02:06.999> you<00:02:07.240> are<00:02:07.359> under<00:02:07.630> any<00:02:07.810> other<00:02:07.899> menu

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
polygons if you are under any other menu

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.950 
polygons if you are under any other menu
this<00:02:08.789> context-sensitive<00:02:09.789> menu<00:02:10.090> on<00:02:10.390> top<00:02:10.539> will

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
this context-sensitive menu on top will

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.830 
this context-sensitive menu on top will
change<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:12.340> need<00:02:12.490> polygons<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.240> we<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.569> our

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
change we need polygons so we have our

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.860 
change we need polygons so we have our
mesh<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
mesh and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.580 
mesh and
mesh<00:02:15.159> so<00:02:16.159> let's<00:02:16.400> go<00:02:16.549> under<00:02:16.940> mesh<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.590> let's

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
mesh so let's go under mesh and let's

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.050 
mesh so let's go under mesh and let's
start<00:02:18.860> adding<00:02:19.190> some<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.459> these<00:02:19.549> items<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:20.030> our

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
start adding some of these items to our

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.170 
start adding some of these items to our
shelf<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:21.049> add<00:02:21.260> any<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.220> these<00:02:22.340> drop-down<00:02:22.849> menu

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
edge tool and this should be good for

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.789 
edge tool and this should be good for
now<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.159> can<00:03:01.280> also<00:03:01.510> continue<00:03:02.510> adding<00:03:02.870> as<00:03:03.170> we

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
now we can also continue adding as we

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.440 
now we can also continue adding as we
are<00:03:03.920> working<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:04.489> these<00:03:04.760> are<00:03:04.909> the<00:03:05.000> most<00:03:05.120> common

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
are working so these are the most common

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.009 
are working so these are the most common
functions<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.959> can<00:03:06.109> think<00:03:06.349> of<00:03:06.530> right<00:03:06.590> now

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
functions that I can think of right now

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.380 
functions that I can think of right now
but<00:03:09.019> I'm<00:03:09.470> sure<00:03:10.159> we<00:03:10.430> will<00:03:10.579> be<00:03:10.730> coming<00:03:11.030> back<00:03:11.150> and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
but I'm sure we will be coming back and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.349 
but I'm sure we will be coming back and
adding<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.810> lot<00:03:11.989> more<00:03:12.310> also<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.819> may<00:03:14.060> want<00:03:14.299> to

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
adding a lot more also you may want to

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.160 
adding a lot more also you may want to
add<00:03:14.599> on<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:16.370> create<00:03:16.840> polygon<00:03:17.840> primitives

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
add on the create polygon primitives

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.470 
add on the create polygon primitives
such<00:03:18.769> as<00:03:18.919> sphere<00:03:19.220> cube<00:03:19.730> some<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.299> more

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
such as sphere cube some of the more

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.830 
such as sphere cube some of the more
basic<00:03:20.989> shapes<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.950> it's<00:03:21.980> ad<00:03:22.579> sphere<00:03:23.090> let's<00:03:23.660> add

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
basic shapes so it's ad sphere let's add

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.580 
basic shapes so it's ad sphere let's add
cube<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:25.190> cylinder<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.060> also<00:03:26.540> plane<00:03:26.810> we

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
cube and a cylinder and also plane we

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.099 
cube and a cylinder and also plane we
can<00:03:27.709> reposition<00:03:28.340> them<00:03:28.489> as<00:03:28.669> to<00:03:29.359> where<00:03:29.780> they

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
can reposition them as to where they

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.970 
can reposition them as to where they
appear<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.769> sequence<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.519> our<00:03:32.060> tool<00:03:32.389> shelf<00:03:32.980> to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
appear in sequence on our tool shelf to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.240 
appear in sequence on our tool shelf to
do<00:03:34.129> so<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:34.519> can<00:03:34.700> middle<00:03:35.150> mouse<00:03:35.450> click<00:03:36.129> over<00:03:37.129> an

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
do so we can middle mouse click over an

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.369 
do so we can middle mouse click over an
icon<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.879> just<00:03:38.060> drag<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> beginning

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
icon and just drag it to the beginning

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.640 
icon and just drag it to the beginning
and<00:03:39.530> we<00:03:40.430> can<00:03:40.609> move<00:03:40.879> any<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.450> these<00:03:41.569> items<00:03:41.780> just

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
and we can move any of these items just

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.129 
and we can move any of these items just
so<00:03:42.829> middle<00:03:43.160> mouse<00:03:43.310> click<00:03:43.340> hold<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.180> move<00:03:44.840> and

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
so middle mouse click hold and move and

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.849 
so middle mouse click hold and move and
we<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.190> rearrange<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.879> reposition<00:03:47.449> these

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
we can rearrange in reposition these

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.770 
we can rearrange in reposition these
anywhere<00:03:48.859> we<00:03:49.069> want<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.150> some<00:03:50.419> of<00:03:50.449> the<00:03:50.599> more

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
anywhere we want so some of the more

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.930 
anywhere we want so some of the more
commonly<00:03:51.349> used<00:03:51.470> ones<00:03:51.919> we<00:03:52.160> want<00:03:52.609> in<00:03:52.849> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
commonly used ones we want in the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.089 
commonly used ones we want in the
beginning<00:03:53.389> and<00:03:53.650> some<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.769> them<00:03:54.889> not<00:03:55.069> so

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
beginning and some of them not so

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.610 
beginning and some of them not so
commonly<00:03:55.910> used<00:03:56.090> ones<00:03:56.329> we<00:03:56.480> can<00:03:56.629> drag<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.560> the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
commonly used ones we can drag to the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.920 
commonly used ones we can drag to the
end<00:03:58.030> another<00:03:59.030> thing<00:03:59.269> is<00:03:59.419> if<00:03:59.569> we<00:03:59.629> want<00:03:59.870> to

end another thing is if we want to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.839 
end another thing is if we want to
delete<00:04:00.169> any<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.769> these<00:04:00.889> items<00:04:01.099> let's<00:04:01.549> say<00:04:01.669> we

that we have in the options box so a lot

that we have in the options box so a lot
of<00:05:34.530> times<00:05:34.740> when<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.100> place<00:05:35.310> an<00:05:35.490> item<00:05:35.639> and<00:05:35.940> then

of times when you place an item and then
you<00:05:36.690> begin<00:05:37.020> using<00:05:37.380> your<00:05:37.410> custom<00:05:37.830> shelf<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.570> it

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
you begin using your custom shelf and it

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.080 
you begin using your custom shelf and it
doesn't<00:05:40.440> act<00:05:40.680> how<00:05:41.010> you<00:05:41.070> want<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.789> most

doesn't act how you want it it most

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.420 
doesn't act how you want it it most
likely<00:05:42.630> is<00:05:42.810> because<00:05:42.840> you<00:05:43.440> set<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:43.889> options

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
likely is because you set the options

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.490 
likely is because you set the options
for<00:05:44.669> it<00:05:44.849> now<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.419> have<00:05:45.570> a<00:05:45.750> couple<00:05:46.020> of<00:05:46.139> options

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
for it now you have a couple of options
