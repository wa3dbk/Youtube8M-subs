 my server we are here so good 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.130
 a few people we are not 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.329

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.460
 short cut with goals of permits to 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.199
 people and then we go back what we already 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.939
 we are here back guys and we are going to 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.529

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.379
 stirrup lando awaited moment here all 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.239
 is to fly a small fire is chosen 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.920
 we have meat bottles of experience 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.640
 for we are on the new map guys that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.219
 I have created now there are already three sky 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.510
 wars the team then the 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.489
 name as it has finally stayed 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.850
 although probably the least served in 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.570
 the title then where hiding to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.430
 we imply this down and so 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.350
 perfect son and we will download in java 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.079
 we make the blocks and see the chest that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.409
 there is more charm of this one 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.149
 we have this yes perfect you told me 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.979
 guys that the emergence of arthropods does not 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.080
 it was absolutely for nothing that it was 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.600
 as it was only for 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.330
 what are the spiders and others for this 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.260
 He could not break this way we put on our boots 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.720
 the pants and we have this we could 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.520
 go to the mine in I think I was in this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.870
 address 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.870
 I do not remember exactly aumentito 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.920
 we have nothing like this so it's ok we're in 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.060
 the mine come let's start walking 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.360
 around here we will need a peak of 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.910
 this can be picked up like this 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.910
 he does not hear all this 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.250
 because lost and itching well but I do not have 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.590
 Block your eyes is the time 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.280
 anxiety first time you have past voucher 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.990
 well we put this and this I think what 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.209
 I will treat in this way 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.400
 but what has iron no no does not have 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.600
 of iron today that we can make ourselves one 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.190
 Now that I think about it, taking this 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.190
 for them he had these times lost 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.290
 we have to make all this a 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.500
 oven and the oven we could do it 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.660
 being at the peak so let's go 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.280
 directly towards the peak that I think that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.569
 I was here now 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.249
 to see well 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.469
 courses is already dead let's expel a 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.819
 the people who die are worth it because as only 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.760
 let's play this game because 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.450
 not that I want it to be very long 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.260
 I'm going to take this I put here 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.260
 I put here 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.050
 we see this we keep biting and good the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.480
 truth is that the name guys do what 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.970
 you have curried is there is the sign 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.310
 of the name is unjust and is very 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.500
 close but very far so we're going to 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.110
 keep taking more this profile 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.990
 I think the latter does not, though 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.880
 they remain very effective and I fall 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.730
 OK 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.230
 let's go in this direction I hope that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.140
 do not throw me nobody because I'm in a 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.700
 site a little bit bad cojemos these blocks 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.190
 and we get closer so it's worth now sometimes 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.120
 here we have 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.380
 wood let's take it well well I think 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.630
 that the boys had nothing to say 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.320
 that has modulated well I think not 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.960
 I had nothing to say to you or maybe I did 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.670
 I think so, it turns out that today 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.720
 will have to be uploading a game of 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.630
 sky wars that invited me is worth none 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.130
 purchases but in the end I said well for 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.690
 that people at least see already as 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.830
 is he would serve more I'll start to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.970
 do it already so I 've been going to be 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.470
 the reason why he has recorded this 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.680
 I'm like a little silly goals that 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.270
 I'm thinking what milk to do to the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.680
 others know based on kraft eo 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.680
 go to be this iron here 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.950
 my friend loaded dead 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.250
 do not tell me that grace a turn 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.250
 weather 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.150
 do not tell me that in the dead gravel 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.759
 I think it follows him but then 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.759
 Moscow moment 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.870
 to nothing 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.530
 I think this one was of various costumes 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.530
 they took 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.510
 the perfect helmet to see we have to 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.160
 make us a first-class oven so 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.030
 first we put the fretting table here 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:54.550
 and the oven so perfect 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.569
 we take this and put this and the iron 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.429
 OK 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.949
 we can pull a position of speed 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:04.180
 now and one of healing we do not have 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.400
 dates or arcs now that I think about it 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.770
 to the coffee will have the best is most likely 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.430
 that he has it because I think that in this 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.700
 I put that and sword now that I say 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.180
 I do not have 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.969
 we are one in front and two at the 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:26.249
 left the key d 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:28.559
 the tb of sustenance to my play 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.200
 that I am this is looking at me like a 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.970
 bad thing 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.970
 you are living as a bad thing 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.930
 go Go 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.389
 hehehe 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.690
 is the other there we eat that you have the 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.690
 another there 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:56.810
 no no no no no 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:58.130
 is that it can not be good to see I think 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.450
 that the time has come since dead 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.340
 to teach us the server how is 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.230
 staying and so as the power of 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.000
 fly again and I teach it to see this 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.940
 is the lobby as well you know I've put 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.200
 two burritos I have put price plates 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.920
 so that good people who do not go to this 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.990
 photo then have that here we have sky 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.730
 wasting youtube share this is the 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.700
 map is worth what would be the 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.140
 islands here we have a two and three and 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.880
 these are the names of the sky 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.260
 guards yekina elephants kiwis and here 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.140
 again he gets the same and here 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.009
 we would have the name of the server 321 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.869
 crossed out 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.869
 share that idea 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.690
 Well, we already think that he has stayed with 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.129
 this name the truth is that they had 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.199
 many comments what 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:48.179
 they said since I could share 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:52.469
 what happens that there were also people who 

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:54.869
 he said to put tim ward skyteam so 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:56.939
 I decided to combine everything and decided to put 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:58.259
 buy graphic sky team wars and good 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:00.749
 let's take a look at the islands 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.580
 to finish this is the one of kiwis that 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:04.919
 we've been playing it's worth this I think 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.009
 would be the cattle was the winner of the 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.139
 starting almost from rositas 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.610
 then here we have the elephant map 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.119
 I think you still will not have it 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.409
 seen because when we played that game 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:17.089
 it seems to me that this was not yet 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.800
 done first as you see these are from 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:21.439
 Elephants worth is pretty pretty 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.169
 especially also in finishing and this is 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:26.539
 the one that would know the corners that good 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.099
 here you have the woods this and the center 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:31.159
 that by the way of people who do not know that 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:33.139
 this here is com press you can go to 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.270
 center and also go around here but hey 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:36.680
 I think that what I have to say 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.979
 where are the people that are sticking 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.999
 with the mules and I really like that 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:43.159
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:44.990
 this video guys the sky one will be what 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:48.559
 what I want to do was show you what 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:50.330
 ok I had not planned to record this 

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:52.819
 departure for nothing but good on arrival 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.080
 the engraving and it's over so that's how 

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:55.909
 I said I hope you liked it in 

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.439
 the game you know that if you want morris 

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:58.879
 skyworks if I'm going to say the 

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.620
 comments were leaving your there 

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:02.029
 to remember that we wrote it and then 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.300
