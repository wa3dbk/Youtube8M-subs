00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
are your black cards these are your red

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.319 
are your black cards these are your red
cards<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.950> will<00:02:03.950> now<00:02:04.069> turn<00:02:04.130> over<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:05.000> show<00:02:05.270> you

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
cards and will now turn over to show you

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.320 
cards and will now turn over to show you
that<00:02:06.170> my<00:02:06.709> cards<00:02:07.159> are<00:02:07.310> all<00:02:07.459> black<00:02:07.729> where<00:02:08.179> your

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
that my cards are all black where your

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.779 
that my cards are all black where your
cards<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:08.810> black<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.379> my<00:02:09.950> cards<00:02:10.340> are<00:02:10.429> all<00:02:10.549> red

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
cards are black and my cards are all red

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.449 
cards are black and my cards are all red
right<00:02:11.510> next<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.900> your<00:02:12.049> red<00:02:12.260> cards<00:02:12.680> okay<00:02:13.220> this

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
right next to your red cards okay this

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.580 
right next to your red cards okay this
is<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> very<00:02:13.910> deceptive<00:02:14.420> self<00:02:14.870> working<00:02:15.319> card

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
is a very deceptive self working card

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.440 
is a very deceptive self working card
trick<00:02:15.829> that<00:02:16.010> uses<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.489> Gilbreth<00:02:16.880> principle

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
trick that uses the Gilbreth principle

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
trick that uses the Gilbreth principle
you<00:02:17.750> need<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.049> set<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.440> cards<00:02:18.769> up<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.160> red

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you need to set the cards up in red

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.280 
you need to set the cards up in red
black<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:19.940> black<00:02:20.180> red<00:02:20.480> order<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.200> way

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
black or black red order all the way

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.080 
black or black red order all the way
through<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.650> entire<00:02:21.680> deck<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.579> you<00:02:22.819> want<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
through the entire deck and you want the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.180 
through the entire deck and you want the
exact<00:02:23.450> same<00:02:23.660> number<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.049> red<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.530> black<00:02:24.650> cards

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
exact same number of red and black cards

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.520 
exact same number of red and black cards
so<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> card<00:02:26.269> set<00:02:26.540> up<00:02:26.690> black<00:02:26.959> red<00:02:27.260> all

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
so I have the card set up black red all

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
so I have the card set up black red all
the<00:02:27.590> way<00:02:27.860> through<00:02:28.280> or<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.209> set<00:02:29.540> them<00:02:29.690> up

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the way through or you can set them up

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.140 
the way through or you can set them up
red<00:02:30.049> black<00:02:30.290> all<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.560> way<00:02:30.680> through<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.459> now

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
red black all the way through and now

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.300 
red black all the way through and now
you're<00:02:32.329> ready<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.540> begin<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.739> what<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> did<00:02:34.010> at

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
you're ready to begin so what I did at

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.460 
you're ready to begin so what I did at
first<00:02:34.549> was<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:34.970> showed<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.390> cards<00:02:35.690> by<00:02:35.840> turning

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
first was I showed the cards by turning

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.440 
first was I showed the cards by turning
the<00:02:36.560> cards<00:02:36.860> over<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.160> dribbling<00:02:37.730> them<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.390> if

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
the cards over and dribbling them so if

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.210 
the cards over and dribbling them so if
you<00:02:38.540> dribble<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.959> cards<00:02:39.319> they<00:02:39.440> drop<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:39.920> pairs

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
you dribble the cards they drop in pairs

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.430 
you dribble the cards they drop in pairs
and<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:41.090> doesn't<00:02:41.390> look<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.840> cards<00:02:42.200> are

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
and it doesn't look like the cards are

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.949 
and it doesn't look like the cards are
in<00:02:42.500> any<00:02:43.099> order<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:44.030> can<00:02:44.209> see<00:02:44.390> red<00:02:44.599> cards

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
in any order you can see red cards

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.780 
in any order you can see red cards
together<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.590> black<00:02:45.739> cards<00:02:46.099> together<00:02:46.250> so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
together and black cards together so

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.280 
together and black cards together so
that's<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.209> way<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.480> showing<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.930> cards

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
that's one way of showing the cards

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990 
that's one way of showing the cards
another<00:02:48.739> way<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.250> can<00:02:49.370> spread<00:02:49.639> them<00:02:49.850> out

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
another way is you can spread them out

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.910 
another way is you can spread them out
in<00:02:50.239> clumps<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.810> two<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.139> three<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.829> can

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
in clumps of two or three so you can

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.559 
in clumps of two or three so you can
just<00:02:52.069> push<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.489> cards<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.030> show<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.450> all

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
just push the cards and show that all

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.840 
just push the cards and show that all
the<00:02:53.690> cards<00:02:53.959> are<00:02:54.079> different<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.620> long<00:02:55.549> as<00:02:55.730> you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
the cards are different as long as you

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.640 
the cards are different as long as you
don't<00:02:56.030> show<00:02:56.269> them<00:02:56.450> one<00:02:56.600> at<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.780> time<00:02:56.810> now<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
don't show them one at a time now you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.620 
don't show them one at a time now you
can<00:02:57.980> cut<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.310> cards<00:02:58.639> as<00:02:58.760> many<00:02:58.940> times<00:02:59.239> as<00:02:59.450> you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
can cut the cards as many times as you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.509 
can cut the cards as many times as you
want<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.049> won't<00:03:00.230> mess<00:03:00.410> up<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.739> cyclical<00:03:01.220> order

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
want it won't mess up the cyclical order

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.280 
want it won't mess up the cyclical order
of<00:03:01.639> the<00:03:01.730> cards<00:03:02.090> then<00:03:02.569> what<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.780> did<00:03:02.900> was<00:03:03.049> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
of the cards then what I did was the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.990 
of the cards then what I did was the
clumsy<00:03:03.709> fall<00:03:03.950> shuffle<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.730> you're<00:03:04.850> going<00:03:04.970> to

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
clumsy fall shuffle so you're going to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.030 
clumsy fall shuffle so you're going to
push<00:03:05.180> some<00:03:05.389> cards<00:03:05.750> off<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.049> top<00:03:06.260> take<00:03:06.709> cards

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
push some cards off the top take cards

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.770 
push some cards off the top take cards
from<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.250> bottom<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.760> top<00:03:07.790> cards<00:03:08.690> from

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
from the bottom to the top cards from

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.569 
from the bottom to the top cards from
the<00:03:08.900> top<00:03:09.079> to<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.290> bottom<00:03:09.380> cards<00:03:10.370> from<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
the top to the bottom cards from the

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.129 
the top to the bottom cards from the
bottom<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> top<00:03:11.090> top<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.989> bottom

there's<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.680> link<00:03:12.920> for<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> clumsy<00:03:13.609> shuffle<00:03:14.060> in

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
there's a link for the clumsy shuffle in

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.660 
there's a link for the clumsy shuffle in
the<00:03:14.389> description<00:03:14.930> below<00:03:15.049> once<00:03:15.920> again<00:03:16.280> by

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the description below once again by

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.030 
the description below once again by
doing<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.480> looks<00:03:18.260> like<00:03:18.500> you're<00:03:18.739> mixing

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
doing this it looks like you're mixing

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.009 
doing this it looks like you're mixing
the<00:03:19.130> cards<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.269> you're<00:03:20.420> not<00:03:20.569> messing<00:03:20.810> with

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
the cards up but you're not messing with

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.740 
the cards up but you're not messing with
the<00:03:21.230> cyclical<00:03:21.620> order<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> cards<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.569> now

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
the cyclical order of the cards so now

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.750 
the cyclical order of the cards so now
is<00:03:24.109> where<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.500> Gilberts<00:03:24.859> principle<00:03:25.310> comes<00:03:25.519> in

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
is where the Gilberts principle comes in

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.520 
is where the Gilberts principle comes in
now<00:03:26.450> you're<00:03:26.630> going<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.810> do<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.930> nice<00:03:27.109> clean

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
now you're going to do a nice clean

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.420 
now you're going to do a nice clean
riffle<00:03:27.950> shuffle<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.769> give<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.069> cards<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
riffle shuffle you give the cards a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.979 
riffle shuffle you give the cards a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
cards at that point so I went through

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.099 
cards at that point so I went through
