day<00:00:45.850> oats<00:00:46.030> for<00:00:46.330> diodes<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:46.930> after<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.830> we

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
day oats for diodes and after that we

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.700 
day oats for diodes and after that we
are<00:00:48.040> using<00:00:48.340> in<00:00:48.640> bridge<00:00:49.260> capacitor<00:00:50.260> thousand

capacitor<00:00:54.310> so<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.480> main<00:00:55.660> purpose<00:00:55.840> of<00:00:56.200> this

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
capacitor so the main purpose of this

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.720 
capacitor so the main purpose of this
capacitor<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:57.070> if<00:00:57.280> there<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.550> any<00:00:58.860> ripples<00:00:59.860> it

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
capacitor is if there is any ripples it

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.120 
capacitor is if there is any ripples it
need<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.150> reduce<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.570> ripples<00:01:02.080> and<00:01:02.380> after

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
need to reduce that ripples and after

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.529 
need to reduce that ripples and after
that<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.490> used<00:01:03.730> 1<00:01:04.089> lm7805<00:01:05.049> a<00:01:05.469> regulator<00:01:05.890> and

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
that we used 1 lm7805 a regulator and

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.340 
that we used 1 lm7805 a regulator and
this<00:01:07.539> is<00:01:07.689> for<00:01:08.729> 5<00:01:09.729> volts<00:01:10.090> output<00:01:10.359> purpose<00:01:11.049> here

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
this is for 5 volts output purpose here

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.109 
this is for 5 volts output purpose here
we<00:01:11.530> are<00:01:11.560> using<00:01:11.799> a<00:01:12.130> 9<00:01:12.369> volts<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:12.850> we<00:01:13.030> are

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
we are using a 9 volts and we are

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.539 
we are using a 9 volts and we are
converting<00:01:13.659> into<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.049> 5<00:01:14.259> volts<00:01:14.560> why<00:01:15.159> because

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
converting into the 5 volts why because

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.260 
converting into the 5 volts why because

it<00:04:18.410> is<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.340> giving<00:04:19.700> as<00:04:19.850> if<00:04:20.090> by

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
it is it is giving as if by

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.030 
it is it is giving as if by
lack<00:04:20.889> of<00:04:20.919> wrong<00:04:21.400> password<00:04:22.290> so<00:04:23.290> after<00:04:23.620> three

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
lack of wrong password so after three

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.430 
lack of wrong password so after three
times<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.030> first<00:04:25.300> day<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:26.350> am

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
times this is the first day and I am

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.409 
times this is the first day and I am
pressing<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:26.979> another<00:04:27.310> time<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.940> don't<00:04:28.180> know

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
pressing for another time I don't know

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.180 
pressing for another time I don't know
about<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.870> correct<00:04:29.199> password<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.070> am

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
about the correct password so I am

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.810 
about the correct password so I am
pressing<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.639> wrong<00:04:30.970> password<00:04:31.919> so<00:04:32.919> I<00:04:33.190> don't

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
pressing the wrong password so I don't

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.000 
pressing the wrong password so I don't
know<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.630> if<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:34.960> press<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.229> correct<00:04:35.560> password

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
know so if I press the correct password

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.420 
know so if I press the correct password
then<00:04:36.850> only<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.240> will<00:04:37.300> be<00:04:37.479> open<00:04:37.930> okay<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.280> am

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
then only it will be open okay so I am
