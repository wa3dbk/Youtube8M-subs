is<00:05:06.250> how<00:05:06.640> many<00:05:06.850> crew<00:05:07.120> members<00:05:07.180> do<00:05:07.510> we<00:05:07.540> currently

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
is how many crew members do we currently

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.719 
is how many crew members do we currently
have<00:05:08.020> so<00:05:08.740> if<00:05:08.800> we<00:05:08.919> check<00:05:09.040> out<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.340> inside<00:05:09.490> our

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
have so if we check out the inside our

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.000 
have so if we check out the inside our
sub<00:05:10.000> we<00:05:10.900> currently<00:05:11.169> have<00:05:11.320> six<00:05:11.680> crew<00:05:11.979> members

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
sub we currently have six crew members

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.240 
sub we currently have six crew members
okay<00:05:12.760> yes<00:05:13.240> art<00:05:13.570> I'm<00:05:14.380> sorry<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.680> little<00:05:14.950> sparse

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
okay yes art I'm sorry a little sparse

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.520 
okay yes art I'm sorry a little sparse
for<00:05:15.550> a<00:05:15.580> crew<00:05:15.940> not<00:05:16.180> too<00:05:16.360> many<00:05:16.510> people<00:05:16.810> yet<00:05:16.990> well

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
for a crew not too many people yet well

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.840 
for a crew not too many people yet well
this<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.740> one<00:05:17.979> of<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.160> smaller<00:05:18.400> submarines

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
this is one of the smaller submarines

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.460 
this is one of the smaller submarines
the<00:05:19.090> larger<00:05:19.450> ones<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.780> can<00:05:19.900> have<00:05:20.020> much<00:05:20.200> more

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
the larger ones you can have much more

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.350 
the larger ones you can have much more
crew<00:05:20.800> members<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.340> there's<00:05:22.150> different

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
crew members so there's different

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.790 
crew members so there's different
stations<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.229> sub<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.560> will<00:05:23.680> actually

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
stations of the sub that will actually

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.490 
stations of the sub that will actually
affect<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:25.300> different<00:05:25.870> components<00:05:26.080> of<00:05:26.470> your

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
affect the different components of your

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.080 
affect the different components of your
submarines<00:05:26.890> so<00:05:27.039> this<00:05:27.160> is<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.400> navigation<00:05:27.940> and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
submarines so this is the navigation and

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.659 
submarines so this is the navigation and
he's<00:05:28.210> adding<00:05:28.630> more<00:05:29.440> crew<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:30.100> okay<00:05:30.550> will

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
he's adding more crew to that okay will

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.100 
he's adding more crew to that okay will
actually<00:05:31.000> allow<00:05:31.450> you<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.810> have<00:05:31.900> more

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
actually allow you to have more

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.190 
actually allow you to have more
waypoints<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:33.419> give<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.539> more<00:05:34.690> info<00:05:34.960> around

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
waypoints and give you more info around

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.480 
waypoints and give you more info around
so<00:05:35.320> where<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.620> allocate<00:05:36.010> people<00:05:36.340> will

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
so where you allocate people will

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.250 
so where you allocate people will
benefit<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:37.060> in<00:05:37.210> various<00:05:37.539> ways<00:05:37.630> yes

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
benefit you in various ways yes

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.770 
benefit you in various ways yes
especially<00:05:38.740> when<00:05:38.860> you're<00:05:39.039> low<00:05:39.220> on<00:05:39.250> resources

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
especially when you're low on resources

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.300 
especially when you're low on resources
absolutely<00:05:40.780> okay<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.410> you<00:05:41.470> can<00:05:41.590> determine<00:05:41.890> how

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
absolutely okay so you can determine how

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.920 
absolutely okay so you can determine how
you<00:05:42.370> want<00:05:42.640> to<00:05:42.700> play<00:05:42.820> by<00:05:43.240> where<00:05:43.539> you<00:05:43.690> put<00:05:43.900> your

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
you want to play by where you put your

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.500 
you want to play by where you put your
crew<00:05:44.169> members<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.860> how<00:05:45.430> hard<00:05:45.849> is<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.330> come

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
crew members and how hard is it to come

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.909 
crew members and how hard is it to come
across<00:05:46.720> crew<00:05:47.169> members<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:47.770> like

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
across crew members is this like

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.370 
across crew members is this like
something<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.550> will<00:05:48.729> like<00:05:48.760> a

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
something that you will like a

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.250 
something that you will like a
crewing<00:05:50.770> one<00:05:51.190> person<00:05:51.820> is<00:05:51.940> a<00:05:51.970> big<00:05:52.270> deal<00:05:52.480> or<00:05:52.840> will

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
crewing one person is a big deal or will

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.500 
crewing one person is a big deal or will
it<00:05:53.290> is<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.530> big<00:05:53.770> deal<00:05:53.920> or<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:54.520> then<00:05:54.760> salvaging

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
it is a big deal or so then salvaging

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.800 
it is a big deal or so then salvaging
some<00:05:55.750> equipment<00:05:56.310> when<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.570> get<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.600> crew

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
some equipment when you get a crew

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.620 
some equipment when you get a crew
member<00:05:58.900> they'll<00:05:59.200> either<00:05:59.410> be<00:05:59.530> a<00:05:59.650> pirates

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
member they'll either be a pirates

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
because they can really affect yourself

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.890 
because they can really affect yourself
okay<00:06:08.260> yeah<00:06:08.590> and<00:06:08.830> uh<00:06:08.860> what<00:06:09.610> happens<00:06:09.910> if<00:06:10.150> you<00:06:10.690> can

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
okay yeah and uh what happens if you can

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
or are you just accumulate will die if

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.020 
or are you just accumulate will die if
you<00:06:17.430> can<00:06:18.430> kill<00:06:18.640> your<00:06:18.760> crew<00:06:19.380> can<00:06:20.380> they<00:06:20.500> mutiny

you can kill your crew can they mutiny

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.450 
you can kill your crew can they mutiny
so<00:06:22.030> we'd<00:06:22.450> all<00:06:22.540> have<00:06:22.660> plans<00:06:22.900> for<00:06:23.050> me<00:06:23.170> indeed<00:06:23.460> we

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
so we'd all have plans for me indeed we

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.950 
so we'd all have plans for me indeed we
actually<00:06:24.730> did<00:06:24.880> talk<00:06:25.060> about<00:06:25.300> that<00:06:25.480> technically

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
actually did talk about that technically

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.770 
actually did talk about that technically
dying<00:06:26.320> is<00:06:26.620> used<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:29.460> when<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.580> sub<00:06:31.270> gets<00:06:31.540> hit

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
dying is used the when the sub gets hit

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.870 
dying is used the when the sub gets hit
sometimes<00:06:32.380> it<00:06:32.710> can<00:06:32.980> kill<00:06:33.310> off<00:06:33.490> your<00:06:33.520> crew

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
sometimes it can kill off your crew

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.490 
sometimes it can kill off your crew
members<00:06:34.120> your<00:06:34.240> officers<00:06:34.690> won't<00:06:34.900> die<00:06:35.140> because

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
members your officers won't die because

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.530 
members your officers won't die because
they're<00:06:35.680> too<00:06:35.860> important<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.550> how<00:06:37.120> your<00:06:37.300> sub

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
they're too important to how your sub

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.890 
they're too important to how your sub
operates<00:06:37.900> them<00:06:38.050> it's<00:06:38.260> like<00:06:38.410> in<00:06:38.590> real<00:06:38.770> life<00:06:39.900> yes

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
operates them it's like in real life yes

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.180 
operates them it's like in real life yes
the<00:06:41.080> important<00:06:41.410> people<00:06:41.680> don't<00:06:41.830> die<00:06:41.980> they<00:06:42.160> just

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
the important people don't die they just

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.340 
the important people don't die they just
don't<00:06:42.520> die<00:06:42.670> oh<00:06:42.910> they're<00:06:43.750> actually<00:06:44.080> in<00:06:44.110> your

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
don't die oh they're actually in your

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.710 
don't die oh they're actually in your
bridge<00:06:44.620> okay<00:06:45.190> so<00:06:45.640> that's<00:06:45.940> the<00:06:46.060> most<00:06:46.210> protected

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
bridge okay so that's the most protected

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.780 
bridge okay so that's the most protected
part<00:06:46.900> of<00:06:46.960> your<00:06:47.080> submarine<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:48.460> crew<00:06:48.640> members

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
part of your submarine the crew members

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.280 
part of your submarine the crew members
that<00:06:49.090> you<00:06:49.180> have<00:06:49.330> out<00:06:49.510> in<00:06:49.600> your<00:06:49.900> different

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
that you have out in your different

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.050 
that you have out in your different
stations<00:06:50.680> of<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.920> sub<00:06:51.130> in<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.430> danger<00:06:51.790> zones

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
stations of the sub in the danger zones

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.180 
stations of the sub in the danger zones
yeah<00:06:52.660> the<00:06:52.840> danger<00:06:53.110> zones<00:06:53.350> they<00:06:53.530> actually<00:06:53.920> can

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
yeah the danger zones they actually can

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.800 
yeah the danger zones they actually can
die<00:06:54.460> and<00:06:54.730> it's<00:06:54.850> it's<00:06:55.090> a<00:06:55.180> big<00:06:55.300> deal<00:06:55.450> you'll<00:06:55.660> have

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
die and it's it's a big deal you'll have

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.750 
die and it's it's a big deal you'll have
man<00:06:56.020> go<00:06:56.200> out<00:06:56.380> and<00:06:56.620> find<00:06:56.890> more<00:06:57.130> crew<00:06:57.400> to<00:06:57.490> replace

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
man go out and find more crew to replace

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.540 
man go out and find more crew to replace
them<00:06:58.000> yeah<00:06:58.330> and<00:06:58.480> you'll<00:06:58.630> be<00:06:58.750> even<00:06:59.280> slower<00:07:00.280> with

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
them yeah and you'll be even slower with

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.070 
them yeah and you'll be even slower with
resources<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.450> that<00:07:01.540> probably<00:07:01.690> just<00:07:01.930> makes

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
resources and that probably just makes

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.420 
resources and that probably just makes
the<00:07:02.200> whole<00:07:02.230> process<00:07:02.380> much<00:07:03.040> more<00:07:03.070> difficult

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
the whole process much more difficult

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.490 
the whole process much more difficult
yes<00:07:04.060> so<00:07:04.270> here<00:07:04.450> we've<00:07:04.600> wandered<00:07:05.200> into<00:07:05.350> a

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.430 
yes so here we've wandered into a
minefield<00:07:05.770> okay<00:07:06.460> these<00:07:07.180> mines<00:07:07.480> actually<00:07:07.810> warn
