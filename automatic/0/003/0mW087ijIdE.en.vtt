00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
here I wanted to show you the cyclone

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.459 
here I wanted to show you the cyclone
PCB<00:00:06.779> factory<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.130> recently<00:00:09.059> built<00:00:09.469> still

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
PCB factory that I recently built still

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.020 
PCB factory that I recently built still
needs<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.950> little<00:00:11.099> bit<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.309> work<00:00:11.519> done<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
needs a little bit of work done to it

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.780 
needs a little bit of work done to it
for<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:13.230> specific<00:00:13.500> applications<00:00:14.490> what<00:00:14.700> I'm

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
for my specific applications what I'm

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.700 
for my specific applications what I'm
going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.289> wanted<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
going to do with it but I just wanted to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.210 
going to do with it but I just wanted to
get<00:00:16.830> an<00:00:16.920> overview<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.510> how<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> built<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.140> how<00:00:20.100> it

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
get an overview of how I built it how it

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.259 
get an overview of how I built it how it
works<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:22.369> some<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> things<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.910> noticed

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
works and some of the things I noticed

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.599 
works and some of the things I noticed
just<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> particular<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> its

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
just just kind of particular to its

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.870 
just just kind of particular to its
operation<00:00:27.650> but<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.920> thing<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.640> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
operation but the first thing is is that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.250 
operation but the first thing is is that
all<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> parts<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:30.660> were<00:00:30.810> printed<00:00:31.140> off

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
all the parts here were printed off

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.490 
all the parts here were printed off
using<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> 3d<00:00:31.980> printer<00:00:32.780> for<00:00:33.780> specifics<00:00:34.320> on

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
using the 3d printer for specifics on

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.319 
using the 3d printer for specifics on
that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.309> ask<00:00:35.520> me<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.850> I'll<00:00:35.969> tell<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that you can ask me but I'll tell you

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.030 
that you can ask me but I'll tell you
that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> made<00:00:37.110> what's<00:00:37.320> called<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> infill

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that I made what's called the infill

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.420 
that I made what's called the infill
density<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.780> minimum<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.899> 50%<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
density a minimum of 50% just because I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
density a minimum of 50% just because I
know<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.149> pretty<00:00:42.420> rough<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.690> things

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
know that I'm pretty rough with things

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.369 
know that I'm pretty rough with things
but<00:00:44.040> here's<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:44.460> close-ups<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> put

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
but here's some close-ups of how I put

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.540 
but here's some close-ups of how I put
it<00:00:46.410> together<00:00:47.450> you'll<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.770> Y

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it together you'll see that on the Y

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.240 
it together you'll see that on the Y
carriage<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> little<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.250> just

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
carriage that I put a little bit of just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
carriage that I put a little bit of just
regular<00:00:53.460> grease<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> grease<00:00:54.750> gun<00:00:54.780> on

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
regular grease out of a grease gun on

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.880 
regular grease out of a grease gun on
the<00:00:55.260> gears<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.800> keep<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.340> quiet<00:00:56.520> and<00:01:00.890> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the gears to keep them quiet and that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
the gears to keep them quiet and that
also<00:01:02.039> seems<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> work<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.090> only<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
also seems to work good not only that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.969 
also seems to work good not only that
also<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.989> grease<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> threaded<00:01:04.949> rod

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
also put that grease on the threaded rod

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
also put that grease on the threaded rod
and<00:01:05.610> normally<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> don't<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and normally you don't have to do that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.469 
and normally you don't have to do that
but<00:01:08.130> considering<00:01:09.030> there<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> be

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
but considering there is going to be

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.590 
but considering there is going to be
plastic<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.790> who<00:01:11.790> knows<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.299> would<00:01:12.450> else

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
plastic and who knows what would else

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740 
plastic and who knows what would else
flying<00:01:12.930> around<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.490> also<00:01:14.640> quiets<00:01:15.150> down<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
flying around and it also quiets down to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
flying around and it also quiets down to
there's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> limit<00:01:18.090> switches

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there's a there's the limit switches

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.440 
there's a there's the limit switches
those<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.009> could<00:01:20.130> buy<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.700> stole

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
those you can you could buy I stole

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.789 
those you can you could buy I stole
those<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.110> laser<00:01:22.380> printers<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
those out of some laser printers and the

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.800 
those out of some laser printers and the
milling<00:01:25.799> platform<00:01:26.280> itself<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.150> salvaged

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
milling platform itself is just salvaged

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.480 
milling platform itself is just salvaged
Plexiglas<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:29.400> from<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.090> previous<00:01:30.509> project

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
Plexiglas from from a previous project

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.249 
Plexiglas from from a previous project
that<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:33.270> abandoned<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.900> guess<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.890> anyway

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
that was abandoned I guess but anyway

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.020 
that was abandoned I guess but anyway
that<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.619> particular<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.400> measures<00:01:38.759> 9

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
that this particular one measures 9

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.539 
that this particular one measures 9
inches<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.720> five<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> half<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.860> then

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
inches by about five and a half and then

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.620 
inches by about five and a half and then
the<00:01:41.790> base<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> 12<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:45.000> 12<00:01:45.030> base

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the base is it's about a 12 by 12 base

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.859 
the base is it's about a 12 by 12 base
and<00:01:45.930> what's<00:01:46.500> cool<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.509> take<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and what's cool is that I can take this

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.690 
and what's cool is that I can take this
with<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.409> thing<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.799> sturdy<00:01:50.100> enough<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
with me this thing is sturdy enough that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300 
with me this thing is sturdy enough that
it<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.850> portable<00:01:51.560> where<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.159> it

it is portable where you can take it
with<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.720> obviously<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> can't

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
with you you know obviously you can't

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.030 
with you you know obviously you can't
throw<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> around<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:56.159> anything<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
throw it around or anything like that

some<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> basic<00:01:59.520> tools<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> used<00:02:01.009> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
some of the basic tools that I used this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
some of the basic tools that I used this
thing<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:02.820> COBOL

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
thing right here this little COBOL

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.620 
thing right here this little COBOL
Minister<00:02:04.200> tool<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:05.009> awesome<00:02:05.579> all<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> bits

Minister tool was awesome all the bits
you<00:02:06.719> need<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.259> come<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.729> neat

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you need to come with it it's neat

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.100 
you need to come with it it's neat
because<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.539> switch<00:02:09.720> around<00:02:09.869> so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
because you can just switch around so

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.029 
because you can just switch around so
instead<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.440> having<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.770> bunch<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
instead of having a bunch of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.660 
instead of having a bunch of
screwdrivers<00:02:11.610> floating<00:02:11.910> around<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.270> just

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
screwdrivers floating around you just

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.770 
screwdrivers floating around you just
that<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.940> one<00:02:13.090> comes<00:02:13.360> with<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.540> perfect

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that this one comes with the perfect

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.930 
that this one comes with the perfect
allen<00:02:14.170> wrench<00:02:14.349> size<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.010> it's<00:02:15.610> got<00:02:15.760> your

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
allen wrench size and it's got your

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.440 
allen wrench size and it's got your
Philips<00:02:16.300> eyes<00:02:16.860> now<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.700> see<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.090> used

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
Philips eyes now you can see that I used

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.110 
Philips eyes now you can see that I used
a<00:02:20.110> variation<00:02:20.980> between<00:02:21.430> regular<00:02:21.910> Phillips

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
a variation between regular Phillips

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.320 
a variation between regular Phillips
head<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.069> allen<00:02:24.069> wrench<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:24.940> used<00:02:25.120> what<00:02:25.300> I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
head and allen wrench I just used what I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.479 
head and allen wrench I just used what I
had<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:26.410> that's<00:02:26.770> all<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.099> do<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
had and that's that's all you do and

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.620 
had and that's that's all you do and
yeah<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:29.730> home-built<00:02:30.730> machine<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:31.480> it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
yeah this is a home-built machine but it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.780 
yeah this is a home-built machine but it
yields<00:02:32.290> professional<00:02:32.860> results<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.520> it's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
yields professional results it's it's

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.309 
yields professional results it's it's
absolutely<00:02:34.000> amazing<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.870> know<00:02:34.989> I'm<00:02:35.080> still

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
absolutely amazing you know I'm still

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.630 
absolutely amazing you know I'm still
learning<00:02:35.470> how<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.030> anytime

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
learning how to do that so anytime

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.380 
learning how to do that so anytime
unless<00:02:39.640> you've<00:02:39.790> had<00:02:39.819> previous<00:02:40.330> experience

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
unless you've had previous experience

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.979 
unless you've had previous experience
with<00:02:40.870> CNC<00:02:41.380> machines<00:02:41.709> I'm<00:02:41.890> new<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.989> but

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
with CNC machines I'm new to this but

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.600 
with CNC machines I'm new to this but
anytime<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.130> there's<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.370> little<00:02:45.519> bit

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
anytime you do that there's a little bit

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.390 
anytime you do that there's a little bit
of<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.730> learning<00:02:45.850> curve<00:02:46.060> but<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.600> works<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
of a learning curve but it works and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.789 
of a learning curve but it works and
works<00:02:48.400> pretty<00:02:48.670> well<00:02:49.170> what<00:02:50.170> I'm<00:02:50.260> using<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.680> a

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
works pretty well what I'm using is a

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.880 
works pretty well what I'm using is a
dremel<00:02:51.190> tool<00:02:51.489> will<00:02:52.060> be<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> spindle<00:02:52.890> that'll

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
dremel tool will be the spindle that'll

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.979 
dremel tool will be the spindle that'll
probably<00:02:54.040> change<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.720> because<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
probably change just so because that

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.300 
probably change just so because that
one's<00:02:56.200> loud<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.680> noisy<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.130> one's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
one's loud and noisy and this one's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.710 
one's loud and noisy and this one's
about<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.519> die<00:02:57.730> anyway<00:02:58.120> because<00:02:58.299> I<00:02:58.360> use<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.660> a

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
about to die anyway because I use it a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.420 
about to die anyway because I use it a

actually seem to be a little better than

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
machine how I built it was I'm outed the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.599 
machine how I built it was I'm outed the
platform<00:03:45.730> template<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.590> Plexiglas<00:03:48.340> and

platform template to the Plexiglas and

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.410 
platform template to the Plexiglas and
then<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.820> just<00:03:48.970> started<00:03:49.239> putting<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.540> parts<00:03:49.780> on

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
then I just started putting the parts on

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.729 
then I just started putting the parts on
just<00:03:52.420> one<00:03:52.570> by<00:03:52.750> one<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:52.989> literally<00:03:53.530> working

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
just one by one just literally working

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.370 
just one by one just literally working
my<00:03:54.040> way<00:03:54.459> up<00:03:54.760> from<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.299> bottom<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> top<00:03:55.900> I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
my way up from the bottom to the top I

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.319 
my way up from the bottom to the top I
started<00:03:57.340> on<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.549> side<00:03:57.790> you'll<00:03:58.000> see<00:03:58.030> where<00:03:58.299> I

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
started on this side you'll see where I

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.150 
started on this side you'll see where I
just<00:03:58.450> I'd<00:03:58.810> literally<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.590> put<00:03:59.799> it<00:03:59.890> on<00:03:59.920> there

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
just I'd literally just put it on there

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.650 
just I'd literally just put it on there
and<00:04:00.370> started<00:04:00.819> mounting<00:04:01.060> then<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.209> mounted<00:04:01.600> the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
and started mounting then I mounted the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.559 
and started mounting then I mounted the
one<00:04:01.840> part<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.500> then<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:04.060> then<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.359> next

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
one part and then and then the next

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.030 
one part and then and then the next
thing<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.780> did<00:04:04.959> was<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.200> put<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.500> threaded<00:04:05.829> rods

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
thing I did was I put the threaded rods

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.000 
thing I did was I put the threaded rods
on<00:04:06.310> put<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.329> other<00:04:07.420> part<00:04:07.750> lined<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.560> up<00:04:08.680> and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
on put on the other part lined it up and

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.340 
on put on the other part lined it up and
then<00:04:09.730> once<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.090> did<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:10.690> pretty<00:04:11.109> much

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
then once I did that that's pretty much

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.090 
then once I did that that's pretty much
what<00:04:12.150> what<00:04:13.150> kind<00:04:13.329> of<00:04:13.420> set<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.780> up<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.889> once

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
what what kind of set it up but once

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.710 
what what kind of set it up but once
these<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.579> got<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.819> make<00:04:15.940> sure<00:04:16.090> these<00:04:16.239> these

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
these you got to make sure these these

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.039 
these you got to make sure these these
two<00:04:17.019> X<00:04:18.010> carriage<00:04:18.459> or<00:04:18.820> I'm<00:04:18.940> sorry<00:04:19.120> Y<00:04:19.660> carriage

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
two X carriage or I'm sorry Y carriage

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.710 
two X carriage or I'm sorry Y carriage
smooth<00:04:20.620> rods<00:04:20.890> are<00:04:21.310> perfectly<00:04:21.909> lined<00:04:22.180> up<00:04:22.479> and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
smooth rods are perfectly lined up and

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.510 
smooth rods are perfectly lined up and
then<00:04:22.900> once<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.320> do<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.470> then<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.340> can

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
then once you do that then you can

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.610 
then once you do that then you can
easily<00:04:24.729> line<00:04:25.120> up<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.419> center

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
easily line up the center

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.469 
easily line up the center
now<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> thing<00:04:29.129> that<00:04:29.340> got<00:04:29.610> me<00:04:29.819> the<00:04:29.939> most<00:04:29.969> was

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
now the thing that got me the most was

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.420 
now the thing that got me the most was
how<00:04:30.509> this<00:04:30.900> was<00:04:31.110> done<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.379> did<00:04:31.770> not<00:04:31.919> find<00:04:32.159> any

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
how this was done I did not find any

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.980 
how this was done I did not find any
pictures<00:04:32.669> anywhere<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.419> had<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.689> do<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> lot

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
pictures anywhere so I had to do a lot

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.869 
pictures anywhere so I had to do a lot
of<00:04:34.110> guesswork<00:04:34.469> but<00:04:35.370> you'll<00:04:35.490> see<00:04:35.669> how<00:04:35.819> the

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
of guesswork but you'll see how the

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.790 
of guesswork but you'll see how the
spindle<00:04:36.389> you'll<00:04:36.659> see<00:04:36.840> how<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.530> Z

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
spindle you'll see how this the Z

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800 
spindle you'll see how this the Z
carriage<00:04:38.300> stepper<00:04:39.300> motor<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.659> mounted

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
carriage stepper motor is mounted

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.240 
carriage stepper motor is mounted
there's<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.710> bearing<00:04:41.159> that<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.699> there<00:04:41.969> and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
there's a bearing that is there and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.980 
there's a bearing that is there and
there<00:04:44.250> should<00:04:44.490> be<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.639> washer<00:04:45.120> between<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
there should be a washer between the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.339 
there should be a washer between the
bearing<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.740> first<00:04:47.009> bolt<00:04:47.969> or<00:04:48.419> first<00:04:49.110> nut

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
bearing and the first bolt or first nut

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.740 
bearing and the first bolt or first nut
but<00:04:49.530> there<00:04:49.680> isn't<00:04:50.060> not<00:04:51.060> yet<00:04:51.270> anyway<00:04:51.629> I'll

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
but there isn't not yet anyway I'll

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.640 
but there isn't not yet anyway I'll
eventually<00:04:52.229> put<00:04:52.439> it<00:04:52.530> there<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:54.229> you<00:04:55.229> may<00:04:55.409> have

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
eventually put it there and you may have

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.529 
eventually put it there and you may have
the<00:04:55.770> same<00:04:55.800> experience<00:04:56.550> as<00:04:56.759> I<00:04:56.909> did<00:04:57.180> I'm<00:04:57.479> not

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
the same experience as I did I'm not

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.439 
the same experience as I did I'm not
sure<00:04:57.840> but<00:04:58.620> right<00:04:59.129> here<00:04:59.159> is<00:04:59.400> where<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.729> actual

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
sure but right here is where the actual

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.959 
sure but right here is where the actual
bolt<00:05:01.379> or<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.919> nut<00:05:02.099> is<00:05:02.250> supposed<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.580> be<00:05:02.759> that

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
bolt or the nut is supposed to be that

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.409 
bolt or the nut is supposed to be that
didn't<00:05:03.689> work<00:05:03.870> out<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:05.610> was<00:05:05.759> just<00:05:05.789> too<00:05:06.180> tight

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
didn't work out it was just too tight

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.570 
didn't work out it was just too tight
and<00:05:06.599> didn't<00:05:06.840> work<00:05:06.990> so<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.830> went<00:05:07.979> and<00:05:08.129> down<00:05:08.219> here

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
and didn't work so it went and down here

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.459 
and didn't work so it went and down here
and<00:05:08.789> I've<00:05:08.909> had<00:05:09.090> absolutely<00:05:09.479> no<00:05:09.689> issues<00:05:10.050> and

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
and I've had absolutely no issues and

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.070 
and I've had absolutely no issues and
what's<00:05:10.919> neat<00:05:11.189> is<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:12.330> given<00:05:12.629> the<00:05:12.719> nature<00:05:12.930> of

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
what's neat is just given the nature of

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.600 
what's neat is just given the nature of
this<00:05:13.199> thing<00:05:13.379> if<00:05:13.590> for<00:05:13.770> some<00:05:13.800> reason<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.460> need

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
this thing if for some reason you need

this thing if for some reason you need
to<00:05:14.819> have<00:05:15.120> an<00:05:15.270> emergency<00:05:15.509> and<00:05:16.050> stop<00:05:16.949> the

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
to have an emergency and stop the

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.100 
to have an emergency and stop the
machine<00:05:17.490> before<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.240> can<00:05:18.479> hit<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:18.750> button<00:05:18.900> or

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
machine before you can hit the button or

machine before you can hit the button or
whatever<00:05:19.379> all<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:19.949> gotta<00:05:20.129> do<00:05:20.189> is<00:05:20.219> just<00:05:20.400> pull<00:05:20.610> it

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
whatever all I gotta do is just pull it

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.850 
whatever all I gotta do is just pull it
out<00:05:23.419> yeah<00:05:24.419> see<00:05:24.750> just<00:05:25.199> pull<00:05:25.349> it<00:05:25.469> up<00:05:25.529> and<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.770> can

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
out yeah see just pull it up and you can

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.350 
out yeah see just pull it up and you can
get<00:05:26.009> it<00:05:26.099> to<00:05:26.189> stop<00:05:26.400> doing<00:05:26.699> it<00:05:26.789> just<00:05:27.029> case<00:05:27.210> it

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
get it to stop doing it just case it

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.659 
get it to stop doing it just case it
bounces<00:05:27.750> around<00:05:27.779> or<00:05:28.169> do<00:05:29.069> whatever<00:05:29.219> you<00:05:29.520> need

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
bounces around or do whatever you need

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.519 
bounces around or do whatever you need
to<00:05:29.819> do<00:05:30.529> something<00:05:31.529> else<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.949> also<00:05:32.129> did<00:05:32.490> was

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
to do something else I also did was

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.670 
to do something else I also did was
because<00:05:34.529> of<00:05:34.830> Plexiglas<00:05:35.310> is<00:05:35.580> an<00:05:35.699> excellent<00:05:36.680> you

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
because of Plexiglas is an excellent you

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.350 
because of Plexiglas is an excellent you
know<00:05:37.800> it's<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:37.949> stiff<00:05:38.190> material<00:05:38.759> so<00:05:38.940> any<00:05:39.120> noise

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
know it's a stiff material so any noise

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.850 
know it's a stiff material so any noise
that's<00:05:39.629> generated<00:05:40.259> through<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.560> milling

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
that's generated through the milling

that's generated through the milling
worker<00:05:41.190> through<00:05:41.370> them<00:05:41.490> through<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.349> stepper

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
worker through them through the stepper

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.070 
worker through them through the stepper
motors<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:45.060> bolts<00:05:45.360> on<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.569> bottom<00:05:45.870> here

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
motors the the bolts on the bottom here

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.230 
motors the the bolts on the bottom here
transmit<00:05:46.589> all<00:05:46.740> that<00:05:47.009> noise<00:05:47.219> to<00:05:47.550> your<00:05:47.580> table<00:05:48.120> to

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
transmit all that noise to your table to

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.649 
transmit all that noise to your table to
your<00:05:48.360> bench<00:05:48.629> so<00:05:49.469> I<00:05:49.830> put<00:05:50.219> on<00:05:50.250> some<00:05:50.639> rubber<00:05:51.330> feet

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
your bench so I put on some rubber feet

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.029 
your bench so I put on some rubber feet
that<00:05:53.000> I<00:05:54.020> bought<00:05:55.020> from<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.259> now<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.560> funk
