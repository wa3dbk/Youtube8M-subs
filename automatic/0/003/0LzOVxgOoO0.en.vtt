00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
collection that we are not carrying yeah

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.359 
collection that we are not carrying yeah
and<00:00:20.789> then<00:00:21.060> these<00:00:21.270> are<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.949> Harold<00:00:22.949> imports

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and then these are from Harold imports

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:23.840 
and then these are from Harold imports
okay

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
okay

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.320 
okay
cold<00:00:24.630> imports<00:00:25.019> these<00:00:25.580> are<00:00:26.580> produced<00:00:27.000> in

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
cold imports these are produced in

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
cold imports these are produced in
Poland<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:29.400> guess<00:00:29.640> where<00:00:29.760> these<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.179> from

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
Poland and guess where these are from

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.900 
Poland and guess where these are from
Brazil<00:00:31.170> Brazil<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.489> sure<00:00:32.669> exactly

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
Brazil Brazil we are not sure exactly

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
Brazil Brazil we are not sure exactly
where<00:00:33.239> these<00:00:33.360> are<00:00:33.600> from<00:00:34.140> no<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.739> says

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
where these are from no this one says

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.560 
where these are from no this one says
presume<00:00:35.340> yes<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.450> different

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
presume yes these are a little different

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
presume yes these are a little different
design<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.440> different<00:00:37.739> manufacturing

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
design a little different manufacturing

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
design a little different manufacturing
this<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.030> does<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.239> say<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.469> Harold

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
this one does not say just as Harold

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
this one does not say just as Harold
import<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> too<00:00:42.780> if

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
import and you know the thing is too if

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.360 
import and you know the thing is too if
you<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.250> could

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you look at it I don't know if you could

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.529 
you look at it I don't know if you could
be<00:00:44.489> able<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.700> tell<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> camera<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
be able to tell in the camera but this

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.510 
be able to tell in the camera but this
sort<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> has<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> little<00:00:47.250> bit<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
sort of I think it has a little bit of a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.529 
sort of I think it has a little bit of a
bluish<00:00:47.850> tinge<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
bluish tinge to it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.220 
bluish tinge to it

sell with saucers so you get a set of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320 
sell with saucers so you get a set of
two<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:19.650> saucers<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
two with saucers but we have a lot of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
two with saucers but we have a lot of
people<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.110> actually<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> lot<00:01:22.950> of

guys that are sorceress yeah so why
don't<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.119> break<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.869> far<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.140> volume

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
don't you break it down as far as volume

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.420 
don't you break it down as far as volume
eight<00:01:38.159> ounces<00:01:38.610> okay<00:01:39.090> 13<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:41.689> 1612<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
eight ounces okay 13 and then 1612 and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:55.910 
eight ounces okay 13 and then 1612 and
3.5<00:01:53.570> sine<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.600> these<00:01:54.990> teacup<00:01:55.350> things<00:01:55.590> yeah

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
3.5 sine of these teacup things yeah

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.789 
3.5 sine of these teacup things yeah
which<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.369> nice

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
which is nice

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.069 
which is nice
we<00:01:58.799> did<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> cup<00:01:59.909> sent<00:02:00.149> us<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> sample

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
we did have a cup sent us as a sample

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.539 
we did have a cup sent us as a sample
that<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> cup

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that was a cup

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.450 
that was a cup
it<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.659> size<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:05.189> had<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it was about this size it had the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
it was about this size it had the
weirdest<00:02:05.880> handle<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> had<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> smallest

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
weirdest handle I had the smallest

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
weirdest handle I had the smallest
little<00:02:07.799> taneous<00:02:08.399> handle<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.940> mean<00:02:09.090> you'd<00:02:09.239> be

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
little taneous handle I mean you'd be

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.699 
little taneous handle I mean you'd be
like<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.050> cup<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.560> you
