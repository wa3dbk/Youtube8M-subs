00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.820
 One of the reasons for being swept away by card magic 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 My name for the stau card is too high 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.940
 Such for at try easy-to-understand by using the card a little more small number it is today 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.510
 Let's go 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.260
 Cards are 1 to 4 of 5 Spelles 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.260
 cars 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.720
 In front of 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.720
 3 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.450
 The top is the ace and the bottom is the issue 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.750
 And the Please stay tuned face in this age 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:49.420
 Seeing in between 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.130
 Go in part to the top of the eh and I'll Harashi play Jesus 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.670
 National spear you face 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.780
 When I put it in and squeeze my finger, the release is on the top. 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 Is it you like this kind of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:13.560
 It is difficult to borrow , but let's reduce it 4 Marius next card is good 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.620
 If I put my brother 's card in the same way and put the preparation in the same way, I'm still at the top 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.510
 There 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.140
 Hmm 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.140
 Inadvertently jerk 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.360
 Buber and this time 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 Patty's two early face down on 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.960
 pou dou dou 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.340
 I saw that it was funny 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.110
 There properly o 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.750
 I I have been pinched face down 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.080
 Yes there 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.600
 No doubt that this time you put 3 face up between the two cards 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.110
 It was face up, right ? 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.110
 I like it even if I think it's funny or Mie 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.210
 Let's reduce it because it is still a little 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.390
 It is a four-head in the now two remaining 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.790
 The upper card is read and the lower card is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 It is No. 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.129
 And I went into your under the issue of the card 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.069
 (1) If I do an owner, my brother will always have it 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.840
 Let's have 4 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.220
 Let's reduce it 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.480
 There is neither up nor down if it is the last one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.159
 For example 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.159
 Pin how is he
