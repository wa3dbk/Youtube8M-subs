00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:15.929
 a lucky man well that ripped the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.640
 literature if it comes with firmness 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 October showing you the books 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.020
 that I read that I received that I loaned 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.320
 They're just going to start showing you what 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.330
 I received from publishers and I received 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.260
 publisher aleph several books very 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.359
 cool 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.360
 they are releasing and re-releasing books 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 I'm very excited about this. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.940
 all of them 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.309
 the first one was not the first one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.579
 I received but it's what I'm most concerned about. 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.680
 I want to read this book, I want it. 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.210
 since June when I went to a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 event of the publisher that I will leave nobody 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.899
 proposal that I have made about this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.989
 event that has video I will also leave 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.280
 low the link is there they tell you a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 A little about this book I stayed 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 so eager to read this book 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 because I really liked the premise that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.500
 left hand of darkness 10 author who 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 I still do not know how to pronounce but I go 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.750
 know right when you do this review 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 level I know pronounce her name and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.189
 people is a certain author then there has already 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.409
 leave me like this 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.439
 excitedly afterwards they sent me a 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.380
 song for there and the vitz of walter müller 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.110
 I'm very excited about this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 because it is a post dystopia 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 apocalyptic and is a very different thing 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.590
 I feel I usually read although the law 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.380
 post apocalyptic dystopias 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.750
 so take away the reader's complacency 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 You know I really liked his presence. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 so I'm really anxious 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.600
 after that they sent me 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.180
 cage movie which is the latest 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.340
 relaunch them so they are 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.899
 re-releasing all their books than 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.689
 that with these covers so with this 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.869
 standardization is getting very nice 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.909
 they did not send the connection culture is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.829
 a very different book than I am 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.930
 accustomed to seeing totally different 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.149
 but I was well so interested in 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.610
 him for what he has to be 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.200
 Maybe I'll read maybe next year. 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.920
 next year not this year 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.179
 why not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.250
 I'm going crazy we're already 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.260
 ending the year and I have not read all 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.939
 The books I wanted this year 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.450
 end of the road children sent me a 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.040
 dance of cases that is a hq of the game is the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.390
 first he did in partnership with 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.909
 david beckham 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.230
 I do not know if this is how you pronounce it but I 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.610
 I already read and I can tell you that I'm coming back 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.440
 focus it on you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 the record-breaking group made a 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.670
 surprise for the partners and sent 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.950
 Too many windows 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.260
 I did not even know how to be honest with her. 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.329
 existence of this book then I still 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.650
 I'm going to find out what's in it. 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.829
 To pass us by 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.659
 I do not know if I'll read but anyway they 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.810
 are betting heavily on this book 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.030
 already the publisher of the lyrics nor did I 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.170
 the American to the American you choose 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 Amanda, business is very anxious to 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.889
 this book mainly because of the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 positive criticisms of him 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.900
 So, probably this year, I'm still going 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.519
 and read back to talk to you there 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.500
 I borrowed some hqs from my boyfriend. 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.720
 because the aleph publisher sent in May 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.540
 ante caso I was very excited 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.819
 there I decided to start with nothing else 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.239
 less than ever and he has the four 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.169
 first books were released here in the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.790
 Brazil, an edition of 10 years ago 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.260
 more or less laughs are also well 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.340
 old but very careful because he is 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.180
 super careful 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.680
 so here it is first I think I 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.510
 I'm going to be national, okay? 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.690
 He put it to better work, but not 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.400
 I know if I 've already taken it first 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.989
 first magazine of the first flight then 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.599
 has quite something to see why 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.569
 I 'm not going to leave already for you about the 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.760
 books I read because I did not give as 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.680
 united but I'm enjoying it a lot 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.120
 and finally he lent me the saga of 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.909
 marsh monster the first volume 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.319
 of this saga that has thus only been published 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.959
 first volume because later the publisher 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.669
 to give up but even so he said 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.949
 which is well closed so I picked it up 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:12.150
 me excited about this history of comics 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:14.489
 I finally won some say 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.949
 and they came directly from fortress and 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.229
 I loved people because I started to read 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.079
 in August those of color 10 and I was super 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.669
 excited they are lovely and 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.800
 you prejudiced who spoke evil 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.470
 northeast 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.900
 Messi is also very good not to mention that it is 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.310
 superior to ours because we can not 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.379
 do this because it would be bias 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.330
 It's also that I'm here giving a 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.680
 ear pruning on the biased 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.360
 but anyway I got really pissed off with this 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.169
 history of prejudice against 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.960
 northeastern 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.280
 so it's an ear-pull and you? 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.819
 that is biased 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.120
 We started bad right. 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.310
 last and now finally it is and 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.610
 I received something not from a publisher but 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.610
 that company called granada is they have 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.639
 a line of enamels of women writers who 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.240
 honors and several writing writers 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.680
 and I've been here for 29 years. 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.629
 they sent me I still will not show 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.849
 right for you because I'm doing 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.770
 a post a special video about it 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.190
 so I'm not going to school tomorrow 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.710
 by the way, a spoiler 2ª stick 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.150
 specialized in October starting with 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.120
 carlos drummond world feeling 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.169
 de Andrade is actually a remake 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.930
 then he goes to the entrance exam but it is 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.319
 So sensational this book the poems 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.060
 that has here and looks is a very 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.150
 strong for those who like poems 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.919
 Then I read the second book in the series 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.580
 of misadventures in series that is the 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.669
 reptiles and following the third reading which is 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.340
 the lake of leeches and then at last 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.380
 I finally finished the twenty thousand leagues 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.909
 submarine design 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.289
 jules verne does not get carried away very well already 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.180
 I made an example for those who want to know more 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.759
 what I found out about this book 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.919
 the link will be down then 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.110
 I read the astral sawmill that is the 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.900
 fourth book of the series of centers inserts 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.710
 and this month was chosen among the 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.870
 inserts 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.360
 hence I continue my readings as 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.949
 repair and marquinhos that said to 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.569
 You guys in the review I'm going to leave below. 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.419
 which is the book that I liked the most read 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.509
 this year so shot to the book 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:24.509
 My name is the show book of the moment. 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.909
 So all my love is pursued and I 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.490
 finished slower audio persuasion 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:33.090
 from her which is the last published book and 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.649
 I already read neto deceased day 5 but 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.899
 I already told you then come to talk 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:39.070
 with you on them sensational and by 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:42.340
 end it then he vaou indicated 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.470
 is a very confusing reading because the 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.300
 The book itself has this premise of being 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.910
 confusing because of the character 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.620
 but I'll reread this one here and 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.200
 come here to talk to you about 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.360
 have tea

 That's all I read in the month of October that 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.770
 I received 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.300
