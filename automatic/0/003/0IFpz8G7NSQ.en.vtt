00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.570
 the great mute 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.860
 for me we can be happy 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.920
 as usual it's normal 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 no it's not bad 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.660
 despite their differences 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.310
 skinny 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.880
 nothing successful we will take into account the long 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.830
 but the most important of all the year a drop 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.190
 the wade advises and his transfer from his attacker 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.450
 before falling asleep 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.869
 kbl 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.869
 mubarak 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.139
 egypt 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.239
 after that is sure 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.239
 in his dead letter 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.709
 for the time being 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.129
 several months 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.479
 - the -m amendment 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.779
 though 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.069
 for the occasion 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.979
 the user can be visited 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.979
 internet reviews 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.619
 shorter 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.940
 earlier give the maximum and do the best I can 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.440
 and some desire I believe these snakes will have fun the results 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.020
 show that they're coming not that's great now also mean by 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.260
 him but no reason she gives herself to help 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.409
 then you are still there 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.019
 another question 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.219
 info i will vote 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.219
 would it be because anyway 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.919
 convenient 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.129
 true 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.770
 the last instructions 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.469
 we have good sense and in mambourg 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.879
 in the reverse on the displaced to search but what are we going 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.240
 leave without the springboard if we look for skirts and what he can 

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:39.629
 expect a gain of 17% against arrhythmia and 5% that can not 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.919
 all 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.699
 but these two days 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.950
 all the chances 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.770
 in these little tunes 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.780
 we crossed each other because for me it's the court is the thirteenth 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.640
 yet the country of the Oracle carryquote crisis 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.889
 remember that if the race is important of the season the cia staged 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.889
 I'm counting on me 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.909
 but he is not insignificant 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.279
 meet the hen 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.990
 besides 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.860
 brien 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.990
 it's a pity that France 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.689
 and then friends 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.919
 so that makes it possible to meet a lot of people going there having to go talk to 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.370
 other people 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.370
 and then the others 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 2 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.759
 yes is part of it 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.759
 French fifteen at the start 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.909
 to alert 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.979
 once less painful 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
 the barbados 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.400
 there is on the other hand 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.619
 an exit that 

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:50.469
 South 

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:51.149
 one thousand and eight
