hours and 59 minutes so 22 hours we try
to<00:03:41.340> pull<00:03:41.610> up<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.820> combination<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.750> that

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
to pull up a combination for you that

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.370 
to pull up a combination for you that
you<00:03:43.080> could<00:03:43.200> use<00:03:43.820> that<00:03:44.820> wall<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> recommend

you could use that wall that I recommend

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.920 
you could use that wall that I recommend
so<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.760> energy<00:03:47.850> win<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.019> void<00:03:50.840> because<00:03:51.840> I

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
so the energy win and void because I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.710 
so the energy win and void because I
don't<00:03:52.110> have<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.680> void<00:03:53.010> dragon<00:03:53.549> yet<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.970> don't<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
don't have the void dragon yet I don't I

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.570 
don't have the void dragon yet I don't I
didn't<00:03:54.959> want<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.290> actually<00:03:55.470> move<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.280> far
