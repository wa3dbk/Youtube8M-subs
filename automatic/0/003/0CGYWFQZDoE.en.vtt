00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
thought I record that because it's this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.649 
thought I record that because it's this
place<00:01:06.869> its<00:01:07.320> strength<00:01:07.920> I've<00:01:08.909> played<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
place its strength I've played it in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
place its strength I've played it in
many<00:01:09.869> other<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.799> many<00:01:11.070> other<00:01:11.310> ways<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
many other not in many other ways but I

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
many other not in many other ways but I
played<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> medium-range

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
played it more like a medium-range

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
played it more like a medium-range
thingy<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:16.580> didn't<00:01:17.780> feel<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
thingy and that didn't feel right and I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.530 
thingy and that didn't feel right and I
played<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.509> front

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
played it a little bit more up front

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.460 
played it a little bit more up front
that<00:01:22.080> didn't<00:01:22.710> feel<00:01:23.460> even<00:01:23.790> worse<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.960> medium

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that didn't feel even worse then medium

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.969 
that didn't feel even worse then medium
and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.860> played<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.820> long<00:01:27.299> range<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and then I played at a long range and I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
and then I played at a long range and I
think<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.990> good

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
think that that's what it is really good

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.249 
think that that's what it is really good
for<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> long<00:01:32.340> range<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.600> first<00:01:33.990> line

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
for a long range and you know first line

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.609 
for a long range and you know first line
of<00:01:34.640> last<00:01:35.640> line<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> defense<00:01:37.020> sort<00:01:37.439> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of last line of defense sort of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.730 
of last line of defense sort of
defending<00:01:38.390> stuff<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> exactly<00:01:40.320> what

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
defending stuff and that is exactly what

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
defending stuff and that is exactly what

um yeah well I hope that this will stay
like<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.970> live<00:04:27.180> server<00:04:27.540> because

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
like this in on the live server because

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.460 
like this in on the live server because
then<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:30.120> usually<00:04:30.360> used<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:32.930> tank<00:04:33.930> destroyers

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470

then you usually used to tank destroyers
that<00:04:34.680> can<00:04:34.919> be<00:04:35.070> easily<00:04:35.280> penetrated<00:04:36.180> but<00:04:36.600> this

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
that can be easily penetrated but this

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.050 
that can be easily penetrated but this
one<00:04:37.199> seems<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.949> little<00:04:38.190> bit<00:04:38.370> more<00:04:38.580> bouncy

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060
