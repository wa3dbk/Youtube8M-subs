00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.710
 Speak there, youtube movie. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.320
 Good afternoon to everyone, I 'm here for today. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.870
 teach you and is making available 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.539
 in a program that is successful alone and 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.280
 he repeats the movements ie you 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.670
 will have to record once you play 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.840
 and then return to repeat another 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.809
 little thing I have to talk to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.269
 before you start a video 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.940
 Classroom All Looks Alone 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.100
 if you have little life and always play 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.179
 and two to three rounds no use downloading 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.879
 the program 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:47.460
 In other words, there is always that person with 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 little life has my fake offset here 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 the life that has turned the dragon a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.670
 screen with two and there is part of the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.920
 dragon a screen with three 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 so it's no use because the program will 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 give error 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.729
 otherwise can let're good I 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.840
 I'll leave it to you for discretion. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.509
 download the program and give me a record and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.070
 also log in here from the universe 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.770
 what is interesting 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.700
 he has the tables here mark all and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.539
 open for you to see up 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.930
 hour right 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.539
 The team in the corner can play well. 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 so I'm going to close but here it is here 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:35.490
 It's just a video credit . 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.590
 come on I need a person who is 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.619
 use my record that I'll leave it there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.289
 She needs to use a fire-type weapon. 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.840
 super fire real fire that they have 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.020
 some initial 20 and if the angle does not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.049
 was initial 20 will give the shot may fall 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.820
 off the map so I only advise 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.429
 It will lower me, I remind you, you have less. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 who has the starting angle of 20 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.420
 it was the shortcut here you're going to have to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.640
 download my record 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.700
 you'll have to change the shortcut here 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.770
 example you use most first 50 percent and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.200
 20 percent how I use this account 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.930
 when you come here on the shortcut and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.560
 shortcut 50 put the third one you use 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.640
 which is 20% 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.370
 if you use 3444 you will get back 50 per 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120
 cent if you use 345 the one that is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.930
 normal 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.260
 and if you use 346 and 347 at last it goes with 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.459
 your thinking and do both right 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:40.150
 stay in order at 347 okay let's go 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:41.769
 It's okay to save and I know the world here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.819
 expects from his puppets the team that goes 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.810
 give a good light down there loading of 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.810
 All right here. 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.630
 This is a bit of the law, come on, you. 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.560
 will vote for him here as soon as you 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.299
 log in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.299
 if you have with my record you will 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:05.319
 do this here and apply and be 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.390
 perfect then repeat that you do not even have 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.810
 moving more normal being alone 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.810
 of class 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.239
 and here below will be written no 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.250
 I can be bad because if I do not leave 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.140
 this is the detail too you can not 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.510
 move while you keep repeating yourself 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.159
 it will not leave 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.219
 You'll have to do everything from 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.219
 new 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.829
 It's over from there that's the important thing. 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.560
 it's also that he waits 15 seconds 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.650
 so it's very efficient I liked it 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.650
 enough 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.000
 God give me a second, I'll go 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.470
 tape mine turns on 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.730
 He's leaving, I 'm going there. 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.650
 record 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:08.569
 come on you will be here on the dot 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:10.970
 that you will click on record and 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.280
 will be staying here already for the sef 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.370
 normal is to do the way you always 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.979
 It's more important not to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.060
 fail because I do not know with 5 you 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.650
 will happen 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:28.250
 He passes strength so I think 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.039
 traditional use angle 25% 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.010
 because if the bar before the Lord 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.650
 let's say 90 to certain that she hit 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.430
 here and back until the 70s she sure as well 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.870
 then look here O rate to 25 use 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.280
 its your damage 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.280
 op you 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.210
 ready 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.210
 the president is also standing there 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:07.550
 now I'm recording here he's staying 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:11.600
 here below the tape here top x maggi f2 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.070
 It is for me to stop because I was there he O 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.710
 killed with two rounds 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.060
 What is the lining in to use this 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:24.340
 program but let's make an exhibition 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.810
 That's not the way it happens with you. 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.190
 op when you have a second you 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:39.830
 shift shift f 2 to 1 second shift f2 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:42.080
 He recorded the tank boot cf cf c 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.630
 boot to repeat five times here goes 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:52.100
 being here repeats five times goes up to 5 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:55.190
 repeat he will start to do so it is 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.470
 That's it people I'll show you 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.890
 leaving him alone and I go 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.540
 trying without remembering anything that I 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.590
 I'm going to try to end up violating here otherwise 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.590
 it will get very long 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:24.190
 alone there the angle it always goes 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.190
 let the opportunity pass 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:35.629
 there you were right now it's not the opposite 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:41.990
 but it's usually half the harbor's course 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:44.349
 always easy step goes far beyond the 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:56.750
 three shots 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:58.879
 That's not it, everybody gave it all right. 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.889
 So I went back to say five 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:04.789
 Sometimes he's down there five times. 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:08.449
 one is 5 of one is not one of 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:11.659
 5 I'm sorry, and then when this is over 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:14.449
 start another round 15 11 the store is 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:16.550
 clicking again to walk saw then 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.840
 this program can help you a lot 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.240
 Hey guys 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.340
