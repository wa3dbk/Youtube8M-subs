00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
transmission you can I don't know if you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:07.400 
transmission you can I don't know if you
can<00:02:59.310> hear<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.640> but<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:03.680> seems<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:06.410> wait

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
can hear that but it it seems to wait

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.350 
can hear that but it it seems to wait
when<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.010> kicks<00:03:08.250> down<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.820> kicks<00:03:08.970> down<00:03:09.150> pretty

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
when it kicks down and kicks down pretty

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.870 
when it kicks down and kicks down pretty
hard<00:03:10.130> did<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.930> floral<00:03:12.930> dr<00:03:13.110> switch<00:03:13.500> here<00:03:13.880> it's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
hard did the floral dr switch here it's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.479 
hard did the floral dr switch here it's
I<00:03:15.239> maybe<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.650> too<00:03:16.769> much<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.040> an<00:03:17.190> old<00:03:17.310> jeep

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
I maybe I'm just too much of an old jeep

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.640 
I maybe I'm just too much of an old jeep
guy<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.269> when<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.540> kicks<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.959> hard<00:03:19.230> and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
guy I like it when it kicks in hard and

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.259 
guy I like it when it kicks in hard and
I<00:03:20.070> can<00:03:20.220> feel<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.549> shift<00:03:20.850> into<00:03:21.480> something<00:03:23.269> it

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
I can feel it shift into something it

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.789 
I can feel it shift into something it
sort<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.570> seems<00:03:24.750> weird<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.080> me<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
sort of seems weird to me to have the

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.720 
sort of seems weird to me to have the
little<00:03:27.769> electrical<00:03:28.769> switch<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.370> actually

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
little electrical switch that actually

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.789 
little electrical switch that actually
kicks<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.690> into<00:03:30.840> gear<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:33.110> it's<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.260> bad<00:03:34.530> but

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
kicks it into gear so it's not bad but

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.229 
kicks it into gear so it's not bad but
it's<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.100> maybe<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:35.640> just<00:03:35.730> something<00:03:36.209> that

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
it's just maybe it's just something that

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.300 
it's just maybe it's just something that
I<00:03:36.390> need<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:36.750> used<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.410> for<00:03:38.160> newer

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
I need to get used to is it for newer

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.000 
I need to get used to is it for newer
cars<00:03:38.640> my<00:03:39.120> other<00:03:39.510> jeeps<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.680> feel<00:03:40.890> it

engage this one you put it in gauge and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.270 
engage this one you put it in gauge and
it's<00:03:44.400> pretty<00:03:44.549> seamless

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.089

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
somebody's going bad angle for this

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:10.449 
somebody's going bad angle for this
corner<00:04:08.139> all<00:04:09.139> right<00:04:09.379> I'm<00:04:09.799> hoping<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.189> head<00:04:10.340> out

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
corner all right I'm hoping to head out

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.280 
corner all right I'm hoping to head out
of<00:04:10.489> town<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:10.909> find<00:04:11.060> out<00:04:11.239> find<00:04:11.689> something<00:04:12.079> or

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
of town and find out find something or

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.289 
of town and find out find something or
at<00:04:12.560> least<00:04:12.709> find<00:04:12.950> us<00:04:13.129> that's<00:04:13.969> another<00:04:14.180> thing

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
at least find us that's another thing

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.289 
at least find us that's another thing
this<00:04:14.480> heater<00:04:14.719> seems<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.109> work<00:04:15.200> very<00:04:15.230> well<00:04:16.299> it's

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
this heater seems to work very well it's

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.930 
this heater seems to work very well it's
a<00:04:17.389> very<00:04:17.599> hot<00:04:17.870> year<00:04:18.199> and<00:04:18.410> actually<00:04:18.530> like<00:04:19.459> starts

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
a very hot year and actually like starts

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.330 
a very hot year and actually like starts
getting<00:04:20.150> warm<00:04:20.389> it<00:04:21.380> actually<00:04:21.560> gets<00:04:21.859> really

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
getting warm it actually gets really

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.339 
getting warm it actually gets really
warm<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.669> it<00:04:22.789> well<00:04:23.509> you've<00:04:23.720> seen<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.110> already

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
warm in it well you've seen it's already

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.659 
warm in it well you've seen it's already
getting<00:04:24.560> warm<00:04:24.740> that's<00:04:24.979> how<00:04:25.070> fast<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.430> heat<00:04:25.639> it

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
getting warm that's how fast to heat it

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.760 
getting warm that's how fast to heat it
up<00:04:25.849> so<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.449> eater<00:04:26.810> actually<00:04:27.169> works<00:04:27.320> very<00:04:27.680> good

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
up so the eater actually works very good

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.620 
up so the eater actually works very good
I<00:04:28.130> don't<00:04:28.639> test<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.940> air<00:04:29.030> conditioner<00:04:29.389> haven't

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
I don't test the air conditioner haven't

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.700 
I don't test the air conditioner haven't
really<00:04:29.780> needed<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.139> this<00:04:30.380> time<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.680> year

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
really needed it this time of year

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.320 
really needed it this time of year
proportion<00:04:33.699> so<00:04:34.699> what<00:04:34.820> we're<00:04:34.910> going<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.090> do<00:04:35.180> is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
proportion so what we're going to do is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.680 
proportion so what we're going to do is
hopefully<00:04:35.720> we'll<00:04:35.900> find<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.349> place<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:37.690> actually

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
hopefully we'll find a place to actually

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.170 
hopefully we'll find a place to actually
be<00:04:39.080> able<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:41.830> speed<00:04:42.830> up<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:43.759> handles<00:04:44.030> pretty

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
be able to speed up it handles pretty

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570 
be able to speed up it handles pretty
good<00:04:44.389> on<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.570> highway<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.430> when<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:46.460> was

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
good on the highway and when I was

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.120 
good on the highway and when I was
coming<00:04:46.880> here<00:04:47.030> I<00:04:47.270> do<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.599> about<00:04:47.780> 50<00:04:48.080> miles<00:04:49.690> but

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
coming here I do it about 50 miles but

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.129 
coming here I do it about 50 miles but
it's<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.310> fairly<00:04:52.970> plain<00:04:53.360> interior<00:04:53.870> but<00:04:54.020> it

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
it's a fairly plain interior but it

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.659 
it's a fairly plain interior but it
works<00:04:54.320> it's<00:04:54.650> functional<00:04:55.099> it's<00:04:55.520> definitely

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
works it's functional it's definitely

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.519 
works it's functional it's definitely
functional

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.439 

I<00:05:02.509> don't<00:05:03.509> know<00:05:03.659> what<00:05:03.839> the<00:05:04.249> the<00:05:05.449> specifications

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
I don't know what the the specifications

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.809 
I don't know what the the specifications
are<00:05:06.659> on<00:05:06.839> and<00:05:07.019> on<00:05:07.169> as<00:05:07.319> far<00:05:07.499> as<00:05:07.649> highway<00:05:08.069> mileage

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
are on and on as far as highway mileage

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.529 
are on and on as far as highway mileage
that<00:05:09.209> type<00:05:09.419> my<00:05:10.199> guess<00:05:10.439> is<00:05:10.619> it's<00:05:10.759> not<00:05:11.759> it's

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
that type my guess is it's not it's

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.959 
that type my guess is it's not it's
going<00:05:12.659> to<00:05:12.749> be<00:05:12.839> like<00:05:12.989> any<00:05:13.229> small<00:05:13.559> SUV<00:05:14.099> it's

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
going to be like any small SUV it's

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
going to be like any small SUV it's
going<00:05:15.089> to<00:05:15.149> have<00:05:15.269> a<00:05:15.299> little<00:05:15.479> bit<00:05:15.569> of<00:05:15.659> issues

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:15.989 
going to have a little bit of issues

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:19.279 
going to have a little bit of issues
because<00:05:16.289> of<00:05:16.499> the<00:05:16.649> high<00:05:17.519> profile<00:05:18.029> and<00:05:18.299> wind

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
because of the high profile and wind

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.249 
because of the high profile and wind
resistance<00:05:19.769> issues<00:05:20.629> it<00:05:21.629> also<00:05:21.779> has<00:05:22.019> a<00:05:22.079> very

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
resistance issues it also has a very

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.619 
resistance issues it also has a very
tight<00:05:22.369> transmission<00:05:23.369> which<00:05:23.579> tells<00:05:24.389> me<00:05:24.509> it

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
tight transmission which tells me it

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.889 
tight transmission which tells me it
will<00:05:24.689> probably<00:05:25.879> affect<00:05:26.879> its<00:05:27.359> cruising

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:29.899 
will probably affect its cruising

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.499 
will probably affect its cruising
mileage<00:05:31.249> because<00:05:32.249> you<00:05:32.549> can't<00:05:32.789> just<00:05:32.969> let<00:05:33.359> it

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
mileage because you can't just let it

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.649 
mileage because you can't just let it
roll<00:05:34.099> it's<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.669> think<00:05:36.029> they've<00:05:36.209> made<00:05:36.479> this

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
roll it's I think they've made this

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.419 
roll it's I think they've made this
automatic<00:05:37.139> transmission<00:05:37.709> kick<00:05:38.009> in<00:05:38.189> pretty

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:38.429 
automatic transmission kick in pretty

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:41.029 
automatic transmission kick in pretty
hard<00:05:38.609> so<00:05:39.239> that<00:05:39.599> when<00:05:39.779> you<00:05:39.899> are<00:05:40.079> four<00:05:40.619> wheeling

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
hard so that when you are four wheeling

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.209 
hard so that when you are four wheeling
it<00:05:41.189> will<00:05:41.369> actually<00:05:42.139> resist<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.799> engine<00:05:44.069> will

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
it will actually resist the engine will

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:49.369 
it will actually resist the engine will
help<00:05:44.429> break<00:05:44.969> the<00:05:45.029> car<00:05:46.459> instead<00:05:47.459> of<00:05:48.199> instead<00:05:49.199> of

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
help break the car instead of instead of

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.619 
help break the car instead of instead of
having<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.159> roll<00:05:50.369> down<00:05:50.579> a<00:05:50.609> hill<00:05:50.729> too<00:05:51.029> fast<00:05:51.299> my

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
having a roll down a hill too fast my

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.989 
having a roll down a hill too fast my
other<00:05:52.289> old<00:05:52.619> Cherokee<00:05:53.099> just<00:05:53.429> whizzes<00:05:53.819> right

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:53.999 
other old Cherokee just whizzes right

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.699 
other old Cherokee just whizzes right
down<00:05:54.149> and<00:05:54.329> yell<00:05:54.419> if<00:05:54.539> you're<00:05:54.659> not<00:05:54.719> careful<00:05:54.959> so<00:05:55.169> I

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:55.709 
down and yell if you're not careful so I

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.729 
down and yell if you're not careful so I
think<00:05:56.369> they<00:05:56.489> were<00:05:56.549> trying<00:05:57.119> to<00:05:57.499> fix<00:05:58.499> that

00:05:58.729 --> 00:05:58.739 
think they were trying to fix that

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:02.869 
think they were trying to fix that
little<00:05:58.919> issue<00:06:00.859> but<00:06:01.859> I<00:06:02.039> mean<00:06:02.219> so<00:06:02.369> far<00:06:02.549> I<00:06:02.609> guess

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
little issue but I mean so far I guess

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.479 
little issue but I mean so far I guess
if<00:06:03.029> I<00:06:03.149> was<00:06:03.329> in<00:06:03.599> the<00:06:06.319> I'm<00:06:07.319> if<00:06:07.919> I<00:06:08.099> was<00:06:08.249> in<00:06:08.399> the

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:08.489 
if I was in the I'm if I was in the

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:11.179 
if I was in the I'm if I was in the
market<00:06:09.209> for<00:06:09.419> four<00:06:10.349> wheel<00:06:10.439> drive<00:06:10.679> ice<00:06:10.919> I

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
market for four wheel drive ice I

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.289 
market for four wheel drive ice I
definitely<00:06:11.459> would<00:06:11.759> look<00:06:11.879> at<00:06:11.999> this<00:06:12.089> one<00:06:12.269> this

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:12.299 
definitely would look at this one this

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:13.519 
definitely would look at this one this
and<00:06:12.569> it<00:06:12.779> seems<00:06:12.989> like<00:06:13.049> a<00:06:13.169> pretty<00:06:13.259> nice<00:06:13.469> car

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
and it seems like a pretty nice car

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.039 
and it seems like a pretty nice car
seems<00:06:14.489> fairly<00:06:14.729> built<00:06:15.029> solid<00:06:15.509> it<00:06:15.629> doesn't<00:06:15.899> seem

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:16.049 
seems fairly built solid it doesn't seem

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:18.409 
seems fairly built solid it doesn't seem

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
a car with four-wheel drive so it does

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:36.329 
not feel like that it actually feels

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:40.339 
not feel like that it actually feels
like<00:06:36.629> an<00:06:37.379> actual<00:06:38.359> it<00:06:39.359> actually<00:06:39.929> feels<00:06:40.019> like<00:06:40.229> an

like an actual it actually feels like an

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.899 
like an actual it actually feels like an
the<00:06:40.649> old-style<00:06:40.949> jeeps<00:06:41.369> even<00:06:41.669> though<00:06:41.759> it<00:06:41.849> is

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
the old-style jeeps even though it is

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.639 
the old-style jeeps even though it is
independent<00:06:42.839> front<00:06:43.259> suspension<00:06:43.939> so<00:06:45.649> just

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:46.649 
independent front suspension so just

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:48.709 
independent front suspension so just
keep<00:06:46.859> right<00:06:47.129> so<00:06:47.579> i<00:06:47.609> guess<00:06:47.999> i'm<00:06:48.179> keeping<00:06:48.539> right

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719

wherever I'm going I'm going
we'll<00:06:52.710> see<00:06:52.860> what<00:06:52.980> happens<00:06:53.630> hope<00:06:54.630> I<00:06:54.720> can<00:06:54.870> get

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
we'll see what happens hope I can get

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.110 
we'll see what happens hope I can get

40<00:06:59.120> I'm<00:06:59.960> hoping<00:07:00.260> to<00:07:00.410> find<00:07:00.590> some<00:07:00.770> dirt<00:07:00.890> roads<00:07:01.160> to

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
40 I'm hoping to find some dirt roads to

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.650 
40 I'm hoping to find some dirt roads to
actually<00:07:01.640> do<00:07:01.760> some<00:07:01.970> testing<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.390> four-wheel

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 
actually do some testing a four-wheel

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.360 
actually do some testing a four-wheel
drive<00:07:02.870> a<00:07:02.900> little<00:07:03.200> bit<00:07:03.290> better<00:07:03.440> because<00:07:04.130> I

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
drive a little bit better because I

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.710 
drive a little bit better because I
didn't<00:07:04.580> have<00:07:04.640> a<00:07:04.700> chance<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.030> test<00:07:05.330> it<00:07:05.510> last

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
didn't have a chance to test it last

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:16.460 
didn't have a chance to test it last
time<00:07:09.400> so<00:07:10.400> let's<00:07:11.380> see<00:07:12.380> how<00:07:12.410> quick<00:07:12.770> it<00:07:12.890> speeds<00:07:13.340> up

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.750 
pulling or see now this is not like like
the<00:07:34.560> old<00:07:34.710> when<00:07:34.860> it's<00:07:34.980> bigger<00:07:35.280> than<00:07:35.400> the<00:07:35.610> old

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760 
the old when it's bigger than the old

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.430 
the old when it's bigger than the old
one<00:07:35.910> if<00:07:36.030> you<00:07:36.150> park<00:07:36.660> right<00:07:36.840> next<00:07:36.990> to<00:07:37.230> the<00:07:37.320> old

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 
one if you park right next to the old

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.790 
one if you park right next to the old
Liberty<00:07:38.000> so<00:07:39.000> this<00:07:39.480> is<00:07:39.510> closer<00:07:39.960> to<00:07:40.110> the<00:07:40.380> size<00:07:40.620> of

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
Liberty so this is closer to the size of

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.900 
Liberty so this is closer to the size of
the<00:07:40.980> older<00:07:41.760> Cherokee<00:07:42.300> rather<00:07:42.780> than<00:07:42.990> the<00:07:43.910> that

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910 
the older Cherokee rather than the that

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.400 
the older Cherokee rather than the that
Liberty<00:07:45.750> there<00:07:47.150> that<00:07:48.150> one<00:07:48.390> I<00:07:48.660> drove<00:07:48.930> one<00:07:49.290> of

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.410 
Liberty there that one I drove one of

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.890 
Liberty there that one I drove one of
those<00:07:49.560> and<00:07:50.070> it<00:07:50.670> seemed<00:07:50.970> more<00:07:51.420> like<00:07:51.570> a<00:07:51.630> little

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 
those and it seemed more like a little

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.210 
those and it seemed more like a little
car<00:07:52.080> this<00:07:52.260> one<00:07:52.440> actually<00:07:52.560> feels<00:07:52.890> more<00:07:53.070> like<00:07:53.130> a

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 
car this one actually feels more like a

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.240 
car this one actually feels more like a
jeep<00:07:54.180> to<00:07:54.390> me<00:07:54.510> to<00:07:54.810> be<00:07:54.900> honest<00:07:55.230> it's<00:07:56.160> a<00:07:56.220> little

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.250 
jeep to me to be honest it's a little

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.890 
jeep to me to be honest it's a little
bit<00:07:56.580> square<00:07:56.940> on<00:07:57.090> the<00:07:57.120> front<00:07:57.420> end<00:07:57.600> but<00:07:57.750> then

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 
bit square on the front end but then

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.080 
bit square on the front end but then
again<00:07:58.020> so<00:07:58.170> is<00:07:58.410> the<00:07:58.740> old<00:07:59.190> church<00:07:59.430> yeah<00:07:59.700> I<00:07:59.790> guess
