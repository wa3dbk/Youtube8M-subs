00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello to all here is notebook of the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.580
 guide the disciples of max so has in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 this video I was talking about a qe2 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.920
 moon 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 so how to get there how to face it 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 what is needed to be able to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.310
 beat 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 and also to snap it to death all the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.240
 world at first 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 go to the cannon over moon that's getting 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 found in 11 10 we could use them 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.199
 in several corners of the balls all 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.929
 it's the closest 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.350
 so here is once canon like a lot 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
 that you teammates a helmet and a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.760
 wooden hall 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.800
 sorry for the little video bugs 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.899
 it will not ask you often so here we go 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 helmeted she does not drink worth buying 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.399
 improve them all the opposite of the expensive 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.579
 talk to the promoters bought a ticket 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.600
 which costs millecam to get the headphones 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:03.270
 and wings go for the domain 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:07.140
 thematic to go and that's it on 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.920
 the island so I advise to go look 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 the zap that you can return when 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.960
 you will want here is a false guard and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.030
 equipment handed over 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 now to the resources it takes 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 to enter forever once again that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.049
 you were cheating those shells doped on them 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.259
 turtles that lies on the beach of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.880
 mills to go 4 to enter the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.509
 jungle 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.409
 so once you have the 4 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.500
 the bug go to 44 5 to enter 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the jungle it will take coconut 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.399
 take enough still 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.670
 will change maps alterna 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 geg 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.340
 because with each change of maps you 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.100
 will lose several your couple you will you 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.960
 deceive on the cuts how much on 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.700
 which shell of each color green 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:07.009
 project the young and finally it will take 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.009
 a headdress the kenny bull mask 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.650
 hide nor ball so bullish 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.370
 buy between that and 150 muqam at 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.030
 following the periods that will allow 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.830
 to go to a part of the island 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.530
 Here again it all in hand is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.720
 gone to get into the jungle 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.780
 so here are each people there you lose to 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.610
 start c gives the cocos the delusional tower 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.950
 so lenovo board these same principles that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.200
 the bretons in an envelope 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.860
 he gogh you so so is you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.940
 watch out for them 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.680
 robien that attack the home by 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.000
 against 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.860
 so here we go for the little 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.610
 path that knows we would see to go 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.430
 up to money so if you prefer 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.590
 buy resources and the drop is 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 as you want for the for walnut 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.200
 on a carapace notebook you can 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.080
 develop because these quest items 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.810
 Here it is that little maskoutains 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.360
 little expensive anyway but hey you 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.890
 will be able to resell provided that he 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.730
 not destroy much hide hatreds 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:23.910
 who are destroying themselves after the theft over to 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:28.170
 his console here came to him so 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.340
 this is the case neither cook ball they 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.080
 wanted would have happened if you would 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.840
 so give your four carapace you 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.560
 would like to be European here you enter the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:49.670
 second war and his sports for a 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.670
 little way that this short stop is here 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.180
 and that's it and so there really has to be that 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:09.590
 bring you the mask to be able to go 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.860
 on the doorman of Lille here is one 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.130
 from the kenny bull mask and it will leave you 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.290
 not pass 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:23.590
 this is the same to deny them thanks m 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.590
 mask 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.250
 so we have to go through so the mask is not 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:34.190
 not destroyed so good you can 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:37.070
 put your headdress here 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.720
 in all the monsters by bringing on the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.240
 path so look out for them 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.130
 can have several times but I have 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.910
 cut for it happening faster 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.860
 here are the nests is not very 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.840
 long but it can be eight dogs 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.150
 if you make to address every 30 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.479
 seconds 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.479
 so here we go 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.669
 plus they say he's good sir 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:14.419
 it's not very strong, it's not going too much 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:18.589
 vices you're not too strong sir jack and 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.449
 kill her to see two distances and 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.969
 so here and taken seven map you will be 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.969
 in front of fashion we happened a blow to 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:31.449
 level 4 his big stone if he wants it 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.449
 capture a product not and it's gone 

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:37.999
 so moon 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:41.029
 what can I say about him he 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:43.789
 step hammer of logical monum to say 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:46.819
 so he taps once per target especially 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.569
 the rounds and still well typed in 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:53.179
 that feels 200 to 500 it depends on the jets 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:57.589
 has a great reach and invokes without 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:06:00.110
 hymn pie accomplice by clement 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:03.069
 takes who voted gic slapping 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.149
 the refi that very random or losing 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.059
 papn force has she etc 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:10.159
 it's really random next 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.449
 skyrock but surely the press or if 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.379
 you know all the totems that 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:17.059
 also evokes know the moon when 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.499
 even a lot of life compared to 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:24.019
 resistances so the match lasts enough 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:27.289
 a long time I thought about crac'h even for 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:29.709
 beat if you are a class of cra he 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:34.099
 are the real ones more easily than 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:38.839
 our class or during several good 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:41.289
 we heard you the road game 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.289
 quietly 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.910
 so here I am until the end 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.150
 of the month nine because the match will last longer 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:59.550
 for a long time we were spared that so 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:07:03.880
 that's how to beat the moon 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:06.670
 good this xp1 at all a goal it's not 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.860
 of xp's to capture and win so the 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.350
 out their boom toon you're talking to at 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:16.560
 mnhn next and you come out with

 our moon hammer spell that is water 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.220
 here is here so by everyone very 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.780
