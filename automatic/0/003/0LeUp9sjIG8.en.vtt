 and with the clip up here holds 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.890
 This is a practical one, you know, there's no lack of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 family party the child's birthday 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.959
 wiki at parties 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:59.250
 one thing that you know me how 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.040
 for those panoramic video things that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.270
 the whole family is sitting at the table and 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.190
 then what you do is that you go 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 turning and you are not going to moderate 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.300
 because you're taking all of them is the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.760
 granny aunt conchita ask for them 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.890
 little primes well back to back values and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.900
 that's a good option besides done 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.790
 I have there are images where I put it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.459
 now that I was in a place in 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.890

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.060
 as for a ship but I see it is 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.950
 Water 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.450
 you could not put on a ship if it is 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.190
 that this was how it was close to the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.260
 tamul waterfall and what I'm using 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.030
 at that time it is fair that the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.030
 Attachment number 4 is the town hall 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.220

 you can put the phone the same with one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.530
 of these here the fact is anyone 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.410
 can go one five- inch 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.420

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.360
 fix with this part of here below 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.950

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.990
 you can already have it well stopped and this one 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.240
 it's awesome 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.640
 at the time of using this handle I do not want 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.140
 be derogatory but it's company and this is not 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.600
 then and goods in Ávila what 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.580

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 will be thinking true is lighter 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.030
 it seems that part of old age and I say 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130
 of surveillance camera suddenly 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.440

 where was this there was some rain the 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:34.900
 people who took out their phone guess 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.900
 What they have that bag 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.790
 then it's this thing called life club 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.430
 and now you're going to put your phone in this 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.430
 part of here and then you put the top 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.370
 gun to the pool also for those who 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.020
 they go to the beach or the ones that goes on the steam 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.850
 they have a call and nothing from jarrai 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.270
 of that to those who drown and then 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.850
 they drown you put your page of abuse before 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.770
 of pachanga 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:16.010
 at this stage on Thursdays also 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:18.590
 hear from attachment number 2 that you 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.480
 you have this corpse this one works for 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.709
 it's all one complete one this is a 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.709
 tree is called 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.770
 It is already designed to withstand 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:42.790
 falls and the blows of life 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:45.690
 heart had something in this did not help 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.690
 but with pleasure 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.970
 but with a phone 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.880
 I do not know if it will break 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.139
 we have the minute what is the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:18.130
 Addition number one this is one of the 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:20.330
 better for me this you put it you 're not going to 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.639
 buy conscience has no money 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.110
 for that and you put your phone here 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.770
 if you can also put it in your 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.900
 bike 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.090
 then if it rains or whatever if 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.800
 you want to connect some speakers for this 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.360
 part clear what happens is that there are some 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.750
 bicycles that they have in control of 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.750
 the handlebars 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.289
 and you can hear like that but I recommend you 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.050
 have a voice and you are more than me 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.880
 hearing aids but there as you like 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.050
 for the bicycle is one of your favorites 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.419
 because they are all city ​​bicycles 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.270
 they are already the five cats are going to 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:06:00.349
 have the summary of the attacks and 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:04.210
 they cost years there are about one thousand pesos 400 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.210
 pesos to 300 pesos 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:14.550
 is 600 pesos to 1 - and 200 pesos in the 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.860
 that is not very clear so far-fetched 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.170
 the phone must be protected 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.890
 rooms that he mentions they say age 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.890
 I liked the faces 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.409

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.699
