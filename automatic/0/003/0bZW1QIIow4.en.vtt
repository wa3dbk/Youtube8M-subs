00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
point so let's take a look at the spell

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.749 
point so let's take a look at the spell
book<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.960> re<00:01:34.380> customized<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.399> spell

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
book they have re customized the spell

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.730 
book they have re customized the spell
book<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.450> looks<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.869> bit<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:39.530> easier<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
book so it looks a bit more easier to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.270 
book so it looks a bit more easier to
over<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.479> honest<00:01:43.040> they<00:01:44.040> haven't

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
over you to be honest they haven't

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.550 
over you to be honest they haven't
really<00:01:44.700> made<00:01:44.970> lots<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.479> changes<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.350> only

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
really made lots of changes the only

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
really made lots of changes the only
change<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.789> like<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
change that I actually like it's the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.680 
change that I actually like it's the
bane<00:01:48.660> of<00:01:48.690> havoc<00:01:49.220> for<00:01:50.220> example<00:01:50.580> if<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.880> bane<00:01:51.509> of
