to be ninety percent of the time

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499 
to be ninety percent of the time
well<00:01:28.170> okay<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.430> still<00:01:29.579> means<00:01:29.880> ten<00:01:30.210> percent

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
well okay that still means ten percent

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.609 
well okay that still means ten percent
of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> time<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:30.899> gonna<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.200> action

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
of the time you're gonna get action

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
of the time you're gonna get action
that's<00:01:32.009> gonna<00:01:32.280> happen<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.880> built<00:01:33.149> into

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that's gonna happen that's built into

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.219 
that's gonna happen that's built into
the<00:01:33.539> equation<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.469> still<00:01:34.829> okay<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.109> this

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the equation it's still okay so in this

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.779 
the equation it's still okay so in this
situation<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.770> end<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:37.979> actually<00:01:38.189> floppy<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
situation we end up actually floppy and

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.389 
situation we end up actually floppy and
mental<00:01:39.000> pair<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.560> decides<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.039> go<00:01:41.159> for

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
mental pair and here decides they go for

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.359 
mental pair and here decides they go for
AC<00:01:41.729> bet<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.469> really<00:01:43.710> important

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
AC bet so I think it's really important

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.669 
AC bet so I think it's really important
if<00:01:44.609> nothing<00:01:45.420> else<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.109> just<00:01:46.350> fully

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
if nothing else that you just fully

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.469 
if nothing else that you just fully
understand<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.090> bet<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
understand what this bet it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.779 
understand what this bet it's
accomplishing<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.679> closer<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.219> bluff<00:01:50.549> or

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
accomplishing is it closer to a bluff or

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.669 
accomplishing is it closer to a bluff or
is<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> closer<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.390> value<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.439> gonna<00:01:52.530> be

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
is a closer to value well it's gonna be

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.200 
is a closer to value well it's gonna be
closer<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.159> value<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.789> think<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
closer to value if you think that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
closer to value if you think that
fighters<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.810> continue<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.530> things<00:01:55.740> like

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fighters gonna continue with things like

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.889 
fighters gonna continue with things like
pocket<00:01:56.340> sevens<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:56.909> King<00:01:57.299> nice<00:01:57.509> clean<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
pocket sevens these King nice clean a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.169 
pocket sevens these King nice clean a
lot<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> time<00:01:58.679> if<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.789> think<00:01:59.999> that

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
lot of the time if you think that

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.090 
lot of the time if you think that
fighters<00:02:00.539> really<00:02:00.960> only<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.499> continue

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
fighters really only going to continue

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.609 
fighters really only going to continue
with<00:02:02.369> things<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.850> Jack<00:02:03.149> extends<00:02:03.929> that<00:02:04.289> sort

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
with things like Jack extends that sort

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.300 
with things like Jack extends that sort
of<00:02:04.710> stuff

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
of stuff

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
of stuff
well<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.030> situation<00:02:06.659> where<00:02:06.840> your

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
well then it's a situation where your

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.809 
well then it's a situation where your
bed<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.469> closer<00:02:07.859> to<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> blow<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.759> a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
bed is a little closer to a blow for a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.870 
bed is a little closer to a blow for a
semi<00:02:09.090> buff<00:02:09.420> very<00:02:10.110> simple<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
semi buff very simple but a lot of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.550 
semi buff very simple but a lot of
players<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.870> confused<00:02:13.320> here<00:02:13.530> because

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
players can get confused here because

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.500 
players can get confused here because
they're<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.130> sure

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
they're not really sure

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.360 
they're not really sure
what<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> bed<00:02:15.019> is<00:02:15.140> accomplishing<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.069> just

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
what the bed is accomplishing so just

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.190 
what the bed is accomplishing so just
kind<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.670> think<00:02:16.730> about<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.330> range<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.750> hands<00:02:18.019> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
kind of think about the range of hands a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.360 
kind of think about the range of hands a
fighter<00:02:18.409> would<00:02:18.590> call<00:02:18.799> with<00:02:18.950> preflop

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
fighter would call with preflop

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.130 
fighter would call with preflop
obviously<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.180> probably<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.750> those<00:02:20.900> are<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
obviously we probably think those are a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
obviously we probably think those are a
stronger<00:02:21.739> range<00:02:22.099> of<00:02:22.250> hands<00:02:22.459> given<00:02:22.819> his<00:02:22.939> super

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
stronger range of hands given his super

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.509 
stronger range of hands given his super
high<00:02:23.510> fold<00:02:23.840> very<00:02:24.290> steel<00:02:24.530> or<00:02:24.799> if<00:02:24.829> you're<00:02:25.220> using

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
high fold very steel or if you're using

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.270 
high fold very steel or if you're using
full<00:02:25.849> diverse<00:02:26.090> three<00:02:26.269> bent<00:02:26.480> same<00:02:26.659> concept<00:02:27.280> so

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
full diverse three bent same concept so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.069 
full diverse three bent same concept so
in<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.760> situation<00:02:29.239> like<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:29.689> think<00:02:29.780> how

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
in a situation like this just think how

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.680 
in a situation like this just think how
wide<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.950> how<00:02:31.730> he's<00:02:32.000> likely<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.450> react

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
wide it is and how he's likely to react

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.300 
wide it is and how he's likely to react
to<00:02:32.720> those<00:02:32.959> kind<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.290> things<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.680> he<00:02:33.799> has<00:02:34.040> his

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to those kind of things if he has his

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.220 
to those kind of things if he has his
queen<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:34.909> situation<00:02:35.480> what's<00:02:35.750> he<00:02:35.840> gonna<00:02:35.930> do

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
queen in a situation what's he gonna do

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.539 
queen in a situation what's he gonna do
with<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.409> he's<00:02:36.620> gonna<00:02:36.769> fold<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.159> along<00:02:37.250> he's

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
with it he's gonna fold it along he's

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.630 
with it he's gonna fold it along he's
gonna<00:02:37.700> call<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.239> lot<00:02:38.420> blah<00:02:38.810> blah<00:02:38.959> blah

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
gonna call it a lot blah blah blah

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.210 
gonna call it a lot blah blah blah
so<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:41.150> decides<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.629> bet<00:02:41.810> gets<00:02:42.170> called<00:02:42.470> ends

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so here decides the bet gets called ends

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.099 
so here decides the bet gets called ends
up<00:02:43.310> seeing<00:02:43.609> these<00:02:43.849> seven<00:02:44.239> in<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.420> turn<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
up seeing these seven in the turn and

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.380 
up seeing these seven in the turn and
here<00:02:45.379> besides<00:02:45.709> they<00:02:45.920> go<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.340> pretty<00:02:46.819> much<00:02:47.030> and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
here besides they go for pretty much and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.830 
here besides they go for pretty much and
effective<00:02:47.840> shove<00:02:48.109> of<00:02:48.440> nine<00:02:48.769> bucks<00:02:49.599> now<00:02:50.599> what<00:02:50.810> I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
effective shove of nine bucks now what I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.479 
effective shove of nine bucks now what I
think<00:02:51.079> is<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.379> really<00:02:51.530> important<00:02:52.220> here<00:02:52.430> is

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
think is really really important here is

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.149 
think is really really important here is
just<00:02:52.790> something<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.359> understand<00:02:54.159> what

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
just something that you understand what

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.720 
just something that you understand what
the<00:02:55.310> bet<00:02:55.459> is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the bet is

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.240 
the bet is
and<00:02:56.090> again<00:02:56.359> probably<00:02:57.079> really<00:02:57.560> not<00:02:57.739> for<00:02:57.980> value

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
and again probably really not for value

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.770 
and again probably really not for value
at<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.519> point<00:02:58.790> because<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> fighter<00:02:59.450> had

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
at this point because the fighter had

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.080 
at this point because the fighter had
say<00:03:00.079> ace<00:03:00.440> Queen<00:03:00.859> was<00:03:01.190> he<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.639> gonna<00:03:01.790> call

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
say ace Queen was he really gonna call

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.660 
say ace Queen was he really gonna call
our<00:03:02.659> effective<00:03:03.079> shop<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.500> no<00:03:04.220> probably

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
our effective shop with it no probably

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.720 
our effective shop with it no probably
not<00:03:04.760> if<00:03:05.329> he<00:03:05.870> has<00:03:06.079> Jack<00:03:06.440> X<00:03:06.680> or<00:03:06.950> Queens<00:03:07.220> plus<00:03:07.549> is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
not if he has Jack X or Queens plus is

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.550 
not if he has Jack X or Queens plus is
he<00:03:07.819> really<00:03:08.060> gonna<00:03:08.180> fold<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.659> no<00:03:09.049> probably<00:03:09.470> not

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
he really gonna fold it no probably not

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.830 
he really gonna fold it no probably not
so<00:03:10.040> better<00:03:10.519> hands<00:03:10.849> aren't<00:03:11.090> folding<00:03:11.540> worse

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
so better hands aren't folding worse

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.690 
so better hands aren't folding worse
hands<00:03:12.200> aren't<00:03:12.349> continuing<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.340> thus<00:03:13.519> it's

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
hands aren't continuing and thus it's

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.910 
hands aren't continuing and thus it's
not<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> value<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.629> it's<00:03:14.870> probably<00:03:15.230> closer<00:03:15.560> to

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
not a value that it's probably closer to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.539 
not a value that it's probably closer to
a<00:03:15.950> bluff<00:03:16.370> or<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.609> semi<00:03:16.909> bluff<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.829> again<00:03:18.829> very

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
a bluff or a semi bluff and again very

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.520 
a bluff or a semi bluff and again very
very<00:03:19.699> very<00:03:20.359> important<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.139> can<00:03:21.260> think

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
very very important that you can think

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.379 
very very important that you can think
like<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:21.919> and<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:22.549> fully<00:03:22.849> understand

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
like that and you can fully understand

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.270 
like that and you can fully understand
what<00:03:23.660> your<00:03:23.810> bed<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.139> going<00:03:24.379> to<00:03:24.440> accomplish<00:03:24.769> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
what your bed is going to accomplish and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.420 
what your bed is going to accomplish and
in<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.359> situation<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.319> probably<00:03:27.829> don't<00:03:28.129> love

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
in this situation I probably don't love

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.369 
in this situation I probably don't love
it<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.699> be<00:03:28.819> totally<00:03:29.209> honest<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.780> mean<00:03:29.900> yeah<00:03:30.199> it

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
it to be totally honest I mean yeah it

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.050 
it to be totally honest I mean yeah it
folds<00:03:30.739> out<00:03:30.829> his<00:03:31.040> equity<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.519> he<00:03:31.609> has<00:03:31.790> something

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
folds out his equity if he has something

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.210 
folds out his equity if he has something
like<00:03:32.269> he's<00:03:32.449> clean<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.079> whatever<00:03:33.889> is<00:03:34.069> that

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
like he's clean but whatever is that

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.210 
like he's clean but whatever is that
really<00:03:34.459> necessary<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:36.680> think<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.069> just

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
really necessary and I think it just

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.740 
really necessary and I think it just
lets<00:03:37.400> them<00:03:37.489> play<00:03:37.639> too<00:03:37.699> close<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.180> perfect<00:03:38.389> yeah

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
lets them play too close to perfect yeah

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.330 
lets them play too close to perfect yeah
but<00:03:38.989> our<00:03:39.019> hands<00:03:39.290> are<00:03:39.440> folding<00:03:39.859> worse<00:03:40.069> hands

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
but our hands are folding worse hands

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.069 
but our hands are folding worse hands
aren't<00:03:40.519> continuing<00:03:41.180> by<00:03:41.419> betting<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.930> don't

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
aren't continuing by betting you don't

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.750 
aren't continuing by betting you don't
give<00:03:42.260> him<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.470> chance<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.099> make<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.400> bluff

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
give him the chance to make a bluff

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.000 
give him the chance to make a bluff
shove<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.209> an<00:03:44.329> ace<00:03:44.449> queen<00:03:44.780> type<00:03:45.079> hand<00:03:45.349> so<00:03:45.980> I

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
shove with an ace queen type hand so I

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.099 
shove with an ace queen type hand so I
don't<00:03:46.340> really<00:03:46.489> see<00:03:46.760> much<00:03:46.940> reason<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.480> go<00:03:47.810> for

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
don't really see much reason to go for

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.229 
don't really see much reason to go for
this<00:03:48.199> bet<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.949> unfortunately<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.000> think<00:03:50.030> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
this bet and unfortunately I think the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.479 
this bet and unfortunately I think the
only<00:03:50.419> time<00:03:50.599> you're<00:03:50.959> gonna<00:03:51.019> get<00:03:51.260> action<00:03:51.739> is<00:03:52.040> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
only time you're gonna get action is the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.159 
only time you're gonna get action is the
time<00:03:52.699> that<00:03:52.730> you're<00:03:53.030> really<00:03:53.359> really<00:03:53.720> really

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
time that you're really really really

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.490 
time that you're really really really
far<00:03:54.379> behind<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.480> again<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.989> big<00:03:57.139> important

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
far behind so again the big important

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.559 
far behind so again the big important
inflection<00:03:57.919> points<00:03:58.340> preflop<00:03:58.909> as<00:03:59.180> far<00:03:59.359> as<00:03:59.449> do

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
inflection points preflop as far as do

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.539 
inflection points preflop as far as do
Erie<00:03:59.840> steel<00:04:00.079> or<00:04:00.230> not<00:04:00.379> love<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.040> Reese<00:04:01.220> teal<00:04:01.400> in

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
Erie steel or not love the Reese teal in

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.849 
Erie steel or not love the Reese teal in
this<00:04:01.669> situation<00:04:02.269> given<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:03.139> staff<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.769> were

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
this situation given the staff that were

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.520 
this situation given the staff that were
looking<00:04:04.129> at<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.540> flop<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.169> turn<00:04:06.319> line

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
looking at but the flop and turn line

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.399 
looking at but the flop and turn line
turn<00:04:06.829> line<00:04:07.069> especially<00:04:07.370> I'd<00:04:07.970> say<00:04:08.409> probably

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
turn line especially I'd say probably

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.080 
turn line especially I'd say probably
not<00:04:09.739> gonna<00:04:09.919> be<00:04:10.069> all<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.220> great<00:04:10.609> I<00:04:10.699> really

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
not gonna be all that great I really

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.550 
not gonna be all that great I really
don't<00:04:11.239> like<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.540> turn<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.989> flop<00:04:12.169> can<00:04:12.440> be

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
don't like to turn the flop can be

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.860 
don't like to turn the flop can be
totally<00:04:12.859> okay<00:04:13.159> but<00:04:13.909> the<00:04:14.120> turn<00:04:14.479> itself

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
totally okay but the turn itself

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.779 
totally okay but the turn itself
understand<00:04:15.680> what<00:04:15.829> that<00:04:15.949> bet<00:04:16.130> accomplishes

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
understand what that bet accomplishes

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.399 
understand what that bet accomplishes
and<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.090> this<00:04:17.180> situation<00:04:17.419> I'd<00:04:17.959> say<00:04:18.169> it's<00:04:18.349> the

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
and in this situation I'd say it's the

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.560 
and in this situation I'd say it's the
kind<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.739> bet<00:04:18.919> we're<00:04:19.159> probably<00:04:19.849> not<00:04:20.120> doing<00:04:20.449> a

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
kind of bet we're probably not doing a

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.420 
kind of bet we're probably not doing a
tremendous<00:04:20.810> amount<00:04:21.320> other<00:04:21.590> than<00:04:21.829> hurting<00:04:22.130> you

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
tremendous amount other than hurting you

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.820 
tremendous amount other than hurting you
and<00:04:22.760> if<00:04:23.210> you're<00:04:23.360> constantly<00:04:23.630> making<00:04:24.289> bets

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
and if you're constantly making bets

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.150 
and if you're constantly making bets
that<00:04:25.130> do<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.520> and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
that do that and

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.740 
that do that and
and<00:04:26.490> you're<00:04:26.640> just<00:04:26.730> gonna<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:27.150> crushed<00:04:27.510> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
and you're just gonna you crushed and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.730 
and you're just gonna you crushed and
unfortunately<00:04:28.230> you're<00:04:28.350> just<00:04:28.470> going<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.650> be

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
unfortunately you're just going to be

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.610 
unfortunately you're just going to be
crushing<00:04:29.040> yourself
