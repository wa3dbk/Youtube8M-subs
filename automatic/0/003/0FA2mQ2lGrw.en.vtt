00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
gonna be so much different to you and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.859 
gonna be so much different to you and
also<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.790> lot<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> times<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.720> those

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
also a lot of times when you do those

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.730 
also a lot of times when you do those
Olie<00:01:25.170> squats<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.119> getting<00:01:27.740> sometimes

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
Olie squats you are getting sometimes

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.520 
Olie squats you are getting sometimes
two<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.369> three<00:01:29.610> inches<00:01:29.850> below<00:01:30.090> parallel

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
two to three inches below parallel

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.630 
two to three inches below parallel
whereas<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> box<00:01:32.159> squats<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
whereas when you do a box squats the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280 
whereas when you do a box squats the
same<00:01:32.820> height<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:33.990> least<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
same height all the time but at least it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
same height all the time but at least it
should<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.890> similar<00:01:35.460> height<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> time

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
should be a similar height all the time

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
should be a similar height all the time
it's<00:01:36.540> either<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.990> parallel<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:37.650> slightly

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it's either at parallel or slightly

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's either at parallel or slightly
below<00:01:38.159> parallel<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.630> could<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> reason

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
below parallel so that could be a reason

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.670 
below parallel so that could be a reason
for<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.990> reduced<00:01:42.990> weight<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.560> you're

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
for the reduced weight that you're

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
for the reduced weight that you're
handling<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.399> regular<00:01:44.759> squat<00:01:45.119> versus

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
handling and your regular squat versus

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.460 
handling and your regular squat versus
your<00:01:46.130> box<00:01:47.130> squat<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.640> make<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.470> you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
your box squat so make sure that you're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.109 
your box squat so make sure that you're
squatting<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> similar<00:01:50.430> depth<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.939> have

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
squatting to a similar depth so you have

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
squatting to a similar depth so you have
something<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.100> compare<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> makes

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
something to compare it to that makes

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.530 
something to compare it to that makes
sense<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.860> other<00:01:55.920> thing<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> times

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
sense the other thing is a lot of times

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.679 
sense the other thing is a lot of times
