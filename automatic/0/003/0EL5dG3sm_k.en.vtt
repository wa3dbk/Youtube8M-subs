00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
was kind of progress for me it was like

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750

I<00:00:27.689> recognized<00:00:28.170> once<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.740> hard<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> train<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
I recognized once as hard as a train is

more<00:00:30.060> successful<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> Caymans<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.500> mean<00:00:32.189> I

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
more successful at the Caymans I mean I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
more successful at the Caymans I mean I
probably<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.360> some<00:00:33.989> talent<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
probably have some talent but that was a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
probably have some talent but that was a
point<00:00:37.520> who<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> recognized<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> calf<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.660> work

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
point who I recognized a calf to work

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.920 
point who I recognized a calf to work
hard<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.480> wanted<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> wake<00:00:42.750> my

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
hard for that and I wanted to wake my

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
hard for that and I wanted to wake my
way<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.350> mean<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> World

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
way I mean there was the World

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
way I mean there was the World
Championships<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> won<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.710> afterwards

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
Championships that I won and afterwards

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.470 
Championships that I won and afterwards
I<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> had<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.320> year<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.270> Timo<00:00:51.270> was

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I think I had a good year and Timo was

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.930 
I think I had a good year and Timo was
here<00:00:51.840> after<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.949> nice<00:00:53.370> victories<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
here after some nice victories there and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.319 
here after some nice victories there and
from<00:00:56.940> there<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:58.219> went<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> 2<00:00:59.579> milligram<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
from there I went to 2 milligram and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.889 
from there I went to 2 milligram and
sink<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.050> also<00:01:01.440> nice<00:01:02.280> experience<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.629> there

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sink was also nice experience is there

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.750 
sink was also nice experience is there
because<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:04.860> time<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.580> me

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
because this was the first time for me

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.580 
because this was the first time for me
to<00:01:06.290> ride<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> leader<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.070> team<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.590> that

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to ride as a leader of a team and that

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130 
to ride as a leader of a team and that
makes<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.010> even<00:01:11.130> harder<00:01:11.280> because<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.960> some

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
makes it even harder because I get some

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
makes it even harder because I get some
pressure<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.770> shoulder<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:15.180> win

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
pressure on your shoulder and to win

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.520 
pressure on your shoulder and to win
then<00:01:15.720> makes<00:01:16.080> victories<00:01:17.659> more<00:01:18.659> enjoyable

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
then makes victories more enjoyable

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
then makes victories more enjoyable
I<00:01:19.560> mean<00:01:20.549> specially<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> Sprint<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.540> a
