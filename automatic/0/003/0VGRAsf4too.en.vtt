00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
tube at the moment which gives it some

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.689 
tube at the moment which gives it some
height<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:38.050> works<00:00:38.289> properly<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.949> I'm

diagrams<00:01:08.560> on<00:01:08.799> here<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.600> now<00:01:14.079> I've<00:01:14.200> actually

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
diagrams on here and now I've actually

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.600 
diagrams on here and now I've actually
got<00:01:14.560> around<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.829> making<00:01:14.860> some<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> pieces

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
got around to making some of the pieces

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.270 
got around to making some of the pieces
so<00:01:15.789> I've<00:01:16.570> cut<00:01:16.780> out<00:01:16.810> these<00:01:17.079> pieces<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:18.100> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
so I've cut out these pieces have the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.870 
so I've cut out these pieces have the
styrene<00:01:18.939> sheet<00:01:19.409> which<00:01:20.409> all<00:01:20.649> be<00:01:21.399> parallel<00:01:21.850> to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
styrene sheet which all be parallel to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.240 
styrene sheet which all be parallel to
each<00:01:22.119> other<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.689> they'll<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:23.109> I'll<00:01:23.979> make<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
each other and they'll be I'll make the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.039 
each other and they'll be I'll make the
body<00:01:24.399> which<00:01:24.700> will<00:01:25.060> hinge<00:01:25.359> eventually

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
body which will hinge eventually

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.230 
body which will hinge eventually
backwards<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.619> forwards<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.969> ken<00:01:28.119> is

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
backwards and forwards and the ken is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.149 
backwards and forwards and the ken is
gonna<00:01:28.359> use<00:01:28.600> these<00:01:28.750> gyros<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.619> servo<00:01:30.100> to

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
gonna use these gyros and a servo to

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.849 
gonna use these gyros and a servo to
keep<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.609> upright<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:32.170> idea<00:01:32.469> is<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:32.680> should

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
keep it upright so the idea is it should

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.099 
keep it upright so the idea is it should
react<00:01:33.130> quite<00:01:33.280> quickly<00:01:33.640> how<00:01:34.509> balanced<00:01:34.930> back

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
react quite quickly how balanced back

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.569 
react quite quickly how balanced back
was<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.289> fault<00:01:35.619> because<00:01:35.859> at<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.130> moment<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
was a fault because at the moment the

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.020 
was a fault because at the moment the
androids<00:01:36.969> a<00:01:37.090> bit<00:01:37.240> wobbly<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.600> his<00:01:37.810> feet<00:01:39.030> which

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
androids a bit wobbly on his feet which

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.569 
androids a bit wobbly on his feet which
doesn't<00:01:40.390> help<00:01:40.450> him<00:01:40.630> walk<00:01:40.780> along<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.100> I've<00:01:42.399> also

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
doesn't help him walk along so I've also

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.609 
doesn't help him walk along so I've also
got<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:42.850> piece<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.210> HDPE<00:01:43.780> which<00:01:44.170> I'm<00:01:44.409> going

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
got this piece of HDPE which I'm going

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.169 
got this piece of HDPE which I'm going
to<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:46.420> will<00:01:46.600> be<00:01:46.750> set<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.500> way<00:01:48.179> with

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
to which will be set on that way with

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.580 
to which will be set on that way with
these<00:01:49.299> pieces<00:01:49.630> sort<00:01:50.469> of<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.740> way<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.520> on<00:01:52.359> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
these pieces sort of that way and on the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.779 
these pieces sort of that way and on the
HTTP<00:01:53.590> I'm<00:01:53.950> going<00:01:54.159> to<00:01:54.219> be<00:01:54.280> mounting<00:01:54.700> the

electronics which are currently this

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.219 
electronics which are currently this
crazy<00:01:57.189> piece<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.490> bread<00:01:57.759> board<00:01:57.999> on<00:01:58.119> top<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
crazy piece of bread board on top the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.870 
crazy piece of bread board on top the
moment<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.649> powered<00:01:59.920> by<00:02:00.009> four<00:02:00.130> doublea's

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
moment is powered by four doublea's

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.649 
moment is powered by four doublea's
let's<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.570> lift<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.840> camera<00:02:02.109> up<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:04.479> can

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
let's just lift the camera up you can

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.130 
let's just lift the camera up you can
see<00:02:04.810> on<00:02:04.929> top<00:02:05.109> there<00:02:05.319> so<00:02:06.749> I'm<00:02:07.749> gonna<00:02:07.929> be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
see on top there so I'm gonna be

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.210 
see on top there so I'm gonna be
replacing<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.770> with<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> new<00:02:09.759> power<00:02:10.119> solution

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
replacing that with a new power solution

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.130 
replacing that with a new power solution
it's<00:02:12.220> going<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:12.730> one<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:13.600> batteries

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
it's going to be one of these batteries

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.200 
it's going to be one of these batteries
which<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> 12<00:02:14.860> volt<00:02:15.100> battery<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:18.210> so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
which is a 12 volt battery and this so

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.360 
which is a 12 volt battery and this so
the<00:02:19.300> servos<00:02:19.660> run<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> 5<00:02:20.320> volts

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the servos run on the 5 volts

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.149 
the servos run on the 5 volts
five<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.640> six<00:02:21.849> volts<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.830> moment<00:02:24.069> they're

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
five to six volts the moment they're

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.800 
five to six volts the moment they're
running<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.430> 4.8<00:02:25.030> volts<00:02:25.360> because<00:02:25.540> there's<00:02:25.750> a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
running on 4.8 volts because there's a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.100 
running on 4.8 volts because there's a
1.2<00:02:26.319> volts<00:02:26.709> rechargeable<00:02:27.610> cells<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:28.269> tried

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
1.2 volts rechargeable cells I tried

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.410 
1.2 volts rechargeable cells I tried
using<00:02:29.379> basically<00:02:30.370> before<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:30.790> battery<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.330> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
using basically before that battery in a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.140 
using basically before that battery in a
3<00:02:31.720> amp<00:02:31.870> regulator<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.370> tripped<00:02:33.610> out<00:02:33.819> over

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
3 amp regulator but it tripped out over

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.509 
3 amp regulator but it tripped out over
currents<00:02:34.599> so<00:02:34.930> when<00:02:35.680> all<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.890> server's<00:02:36.250> run

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
currents so when all the server's run

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.740 
currents so when all the server's run
they<00:02:36.640> pull<00:02:36.819> slightly<00:02:37.060> more<00:02:37.299> than<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.599> so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
they pull slightly more than that so

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.740 
they pull slightly more than that so
I've<00:02:37.870> got<00:02:38.019> this<00:02:38.170> huge<00:02:38.680> thing<00:02:39.150> which<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.329> 12<00:02:40.599> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
I've got this huge thing which is 12 to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.350 
I've got this huge thing which is 12 to
24<00:02:41.260> volts<00:02:41.530> inputs<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.190> 5<00:02:42.549> volts<00:02:42.909> 10<00:02:43.150> amp

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
24 volts inputs and 5 volts 10 amp

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.080 
24 volts inputs and 5 volts 10 amp
output<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.829> along<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.459> battery<00:02:45.879> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
output so along with the battery and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.750 
output so along with the battery and
this<00:02:46.890> those<00:02:47.890> things<00:02:48.190> are<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.549> sit<00:02:48.730> on

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
this those things are going to sit on

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.860 
this those things are going to sit on
these<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.739> electronics<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:52.569> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
these back and the electronics so the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.680 
these back and the electronics so the
idea<00:02:53.170> being<00:02:53.970> basically<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.299> helps<00:02:55.569> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
idea being basically that that helps it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.220 
idea being basically that that helps it
balance<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.450> rooibos<00:02:58.870> out<00:02:59.019> here

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
balance so here is rooibos out here

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.430 
balance so here is rooibos out here
which<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> popular<00:03:00.579> toy<00:03:00.760> from<00:03:01.260> some<00:03:02.260> years

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
which is a popular toy from some years

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.800 
which is a popular toy from some years
ago<00:03:02.650> your<00:03:02.980> popular<00:03:03.310> Christmas<00:03:03.730> toy<00:03:03.940> about

ago your popular Christmas toy about

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.839 
ago your popular Christmas toy about
three<00:03:05.349> or<00:03:05.470> four<00:03:05.620> years<00:03:05.650> ago<00:03:05.920> maybe<00:03:06.250> five<00:03:06.549> years

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
three or four years ago maybe five years

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.660 
three or four years ago maybe five years
I<00:03:06.940> can't<00:03:07.239> remember<00:03:07.829> it's<00:03:08.829> got<00:03:09.010> batteries<00:03:09.250> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
I can't remember it's got batteries in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.970 
I can't remember it's got batteries in
its<00:03:09.819> feet<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.959> keep<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> center<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.620> gravity

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
its feet to keep the center of gravity

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.940 
its feet to keep the center of gravity
low<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.629> stay<00:03:14.500> upright

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
low so that it can stay upright

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.520 
low so that it can stay upright
but<00:03:15.879> having<00:03:16.150> heavy<00:03:16.390> feet<00:03:16.659> on<00:03:16.840> robots<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
but having heavy feet on robots is a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.680 
but having heavy feet on robots is a
pretty<00:03:17.980> much<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.370> me<00:03:18.489> obviously<00:03:19.120> this<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:19.450> some

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
pretty much of me obviously this is some

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.319 
pretty much of me obviously this is some
actively<00:03:20.530> balancing<00:03:21.010> itself<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.030> actually

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
actively balancing itself so actually

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.640 
actively balancing itself so actually
what<00:03:22.450> we<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.900> heavy<00:03:23.140> weight<00:03:23.349> at<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.560> top

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
what we want is heavy weight at the top

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.099 
what we want is heavy weight at the top
so<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.700> demonstrate<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.870> take<00:03:26.049> this

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
so to demonstrate this if I take this

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.620 
so to demonstrate this if I take this
ruler<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.950> try<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.190> balance<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.760> it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
ruler and I just try and balance it it's

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.949 
ruler and I just try and balance it it's
actually<00:03:28.750> quite<00:03:29.049> hard<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.560> well<00:03:30.010> because

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
actually quite hard to do well because

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.319 
actually quite hard to do well because
it<00:03:31.959> moves<00:03:32.200> quite<00:03:32.470> quickly<00:03:32.709> as<00:03:33.700> if<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.090> attached

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
it moves quite quickly as if I attached

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:43.559 
it moves quite quickly as if I attached
a<00:03:34.480> heavy<00:03:34.660> weight<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.169> top<00:03:37.650> band<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:42.569> then

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
a heavy weight to the top band here then

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.319 
a heavy weight to the top band here then
actually<00:03:43.989> it's<00:03:44.260> much<00:03:44.410> easier<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.859> balance<00:03:45.329> he

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
actually it's much easier to balance he

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.990 
actually it's much easier to balance he
says<00:03:46.919> it's<00:03:47.919> actually<00:03:48.310> much<00:03:48.489> easier<00:03:48.519> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
says it's actually much easier to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.659 
says it's actually much easier to
balance<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:50.379> that's<00:03:50.560> because<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.549> heavy

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
balance and that's because the heavy

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.080 
balance and that's because the heavy
weight<00:03:52.000> means<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.049> moves<00:03:53.230> more<00:03:53.349> slowly

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
weight means that it moves more slowly

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.449 
weight means that it moves more slowly
because<00:03:55.139> heavier<00:03:56.139> heavier<00:03:56.590> mass<00:03:56.949> needs<00:03:57.220> more

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
because heavier heavier mass needs more

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.939 
because heavier heavier mass needs more
energy<00:03:57.669> to<00:03:58.000> move<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.629> there<00:03:59.560> we<00:03:59.620> go<00:03:59.650> that's

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
energy to move so there we go that's

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.659 
energy to move so there we go that's
what<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.190> was<00:04:00.280> intending<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.699> demonstrate<00:04:02.669> so

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
what I was intending to demonstrate so

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.360 
what I was intending to demonstrate so
basically<00:04:04.239> with<00:04:04.599> more<00:04:05.530> way<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.919> top<00:04:06.129> that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
basically with more way to the top that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.629 
basically with more way to the top that
helps<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:06.940> actively<00:04:07.329> balance<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.639> means

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
helps it so actively balance and means

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.699 
helps it so actively balance and means
that<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:09.940> should<00:04:09.970> have<00:04:10.329> less<00:04:11.139> trouble<00:04:11.349> staying

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
that it should have less trouble staying

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.619 
that it should have less trouble staying
upright<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.489> won't<00:04:12.669> move<00:04:12.879> around<00:04:13.060> quite<00:04:13.480> so

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
upright so it won't move around quite so

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.780 
upright so it won't move around quite so
quickly<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.590> that's<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.190> idea<00:04:15.459> anyway

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
quickly so that's the idea anyway

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.599 
quickly so that's the idea anyway
so<00:04:16.720> all<00:04:17.440> these<00:04:17.560> pulses<00:04:18.010> have<00:04:18.130> had<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> made<00:04:18.459> with

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
so all these pulses have had a made with

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.550 
so all these pulses have had a made with
hand<00:04:18.849> tools<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:19.810> don't<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.169> 3d<00:04:20.530> printer

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
hand tools so I don't have a 3d printer

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.029 
hand tools so I don't have a 3d printer
or<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.099> CNC<00:04:21.699> machine<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.320> next<00:04:23.500> thing<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:23.800> to

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
or a CNC machine so the next thing is to

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.839 
or a CNC machine so the next thing is to
go<00:04:24.370> outside<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:25.389> cut<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:25.960> HTTP<00:04:26.590> HTTP<00:04:27.520> sheet

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
go outside and cut this HTTP HTTP sheet

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.589 
go outside and cut this HTTP HTTP sheet
with<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> saw<00:04:29.219> so<00:04:30.219> next<00:04:30.610> I'm<00:04:30.880> going<00:04:30.909> into<00:04:31.510> the

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
with a saw so next I'm going into the

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.149 
with a saw so next I'm going into the
shade

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.619 

here<00:04:36.159> we<00:04:36.250> are<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.729> let's<00:04:36.939> just<00:04:37.270> have<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.389> look<00:04:37.509> in

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
here we are so let's just have a look in

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.320 
here we are so let's just have a look in
the<00:04:37.719> shade<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.139> we<00:04:38.289> got<00:04:39.060> stuff

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the shade what we got stuff

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.010 
the shade what we got stuff
Iron<00:04:40.689> Man<00:04:40.870> molds<00:04:41.439> and<00:04:41.680> pieces<00:04:42.629> pieces<00:04:43.629> of<00:04:43.900> iron

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
Iron Man molds and pieces pieces of iron

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.999 
Iron Man molds and pieces pieces of iron
man<00:04:45.750> made<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.930> fiberglass<00:04:47.439> whoo<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.590> stuff

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
man made of fiberglass whoo and stuff

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.249 
man made of fiberglass whoo and stuff
and<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.370> side<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.580> my<00:04:51.819> hot<00:04:51.969> tub<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.900> massive

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
and the side of my hot tub and a massive

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.969 
and the side of my hot tub and a massive
mooring<00:04:53.590> rope<00:04:53.800> which<00:04:55.319> just<00:04:56.319> get<00:04:56.469> out<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.800> here

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
mooring rope which just get out of here

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.610 
mooring rope which just get out of here
so<00:04:57.129> it<00:04:57.219> doesn't<00:04:57.280> get<00:04:57.550> covered<00:04:57.789> in<00:04:57.969> bits<00:05:01.620> right

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
so it doesn't get covered in bits right

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.439 
so it doesn't get covered in bits right
and<00:05:03.069> here's<00:05:03.250> my<00:05:03.400> HDPE<00:05:03.969> so<00:05:06.000> put<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.090> camera

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
and here's my HDPE so put the camera

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:35.459 
and here's my HDPE so put the camera
down<00:05:07.479> somewhere<00:05:32.460> down<00:05:33.599> we<00:05:34.599> just<00:05:34.810> find<00:05:35.080> a<00:05:35.199> saw

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
down somewhere down we just find a saw

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:41.490 
down somewhere down we just find a saw
somewhere<00:05:36.069> and<00:05:36.490> we<00:05:37.090> will<00:05:37.330> cut<00:05:37.599> that<00:05:37.750> piece<00:05:40.500> ha

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
somewhere and we will cut that piece ha

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.200 
somewhere and we will cut that piece ha
ha

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
ha

00:05:42.210 --> 00:06:00.170

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.500 

it<00:06:01.180> is<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:03.190> piece<00:06:03.430> cuts<00:06:03.730> and<00:06:04.180> then<00:06:04.360> what's

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
it is that piece cuts and then what's

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.380 
it is that piece cuts and then what's
gonna<00:06:04.660> happen<00:06:04.780> is<00:06:05.730> these<00:06:06.730> pieces<00:06:07.030> are<00:06:07.270> going

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
gonna happen is these pieces are going

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.690 
gonna happen is these pieces are going
to<00:06:07.480> go<00:06:07.660> on<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:07.840> way<00:06:08.230> next<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.860> each<00:06:08.980> other
