00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
think it was it won't add up to like 125

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.610 
think it was it won't add up to like 125
it<00:03:49.190> won't<00:03:49.760> do<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.390> kind<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:51.290> lower

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it won't do that it kind of it's lower

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.740 
it won't do that it kind of it's lower
than<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.970> weird<00:03:53.180> how<00:03:53.300> it<00:03:53.330> adds<00:03:53.540> up<00:03:53.690> but

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
than that it's weird how it adds up but

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.300 
than that it's weird how it adds up but
not<00:03:53.900> exactly<00:03:54.260> sure<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.800> won't<00:03:54.920> be<00:03:55.040> as<00:03:55.130> high

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
not exactly sure but it won't be as high

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.199 
not exactly sure but it won't be as high
as<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.640> think<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.810> still<00:03:57.080> helps<00:03:58.209> now

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
as you think but it still helps now

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.699 
as you think but it still helps now
personally<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:02.630> just<00:04:03.170> coming<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.500> be<00:04:03.560> nice

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
personally this just coming to be nice

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.560

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.509 
I don't know much of fare against bunker
maybe<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.110> constructor<00:04:09.709> probably<00:04:10.100> do<00:04:10.310> some

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
maybe a constructor probably do some

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.820 
maybe a constructor probably do some
work<00:04:10.700> too<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.290> right<00:04:12.410> there<00:04:12.560> that

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
work too but you see right there that

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.520 
work too but you see right there that
kind<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.280> tear<00:04:13.430> them<00:04:13.580> apart<00:04:13.640> but<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.690> wouldn't

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
kind of tear them apart but I wouldn't

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.830 
kind of tear them apart but I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:16.130> VV<00:04:16.549> HM<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.120> know<00:04:17.570> there's<00:04:17.750> been

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
recommend this VV HM I know there's been

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.960 
recommend this VV HM I know there's been
a<00:04:17.870> few<00:04:18.169> things<00:04:19.039> I've<00:04:19.280> been<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.640> little<00:04:19.820> few

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
a few things I've been a little few

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.930 
a few things I've been a little few
weapons<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.539> stuff

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
weapons and stuff

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.230 
weapons and stuff
doing<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.660> they<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.870> haven't<00:04:22.080> recommended

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
doing that they just haven't recommended

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.770 
doing that they just haven't recommended
but<00:04:24.350> this<00:04:25.350> would<00:04:25.680> be<00:04:25.830> more<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.310> know

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
but this would be more of you know

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.690 
but this would be more of you know
normal<00:04:27.780> mode<00:04:27.960> -<00:04:28.230> volta<00:04:28.500> -<00:04:28.590> mode<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.010> that's

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
normal mode - volta - mode and that's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.030 
normal mode - volta - mode and that's
where<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.940> really<00:04:29.970> shines<00:04:30.710> it's<00:04:31.710> like<00:04:31.920> an

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
where it really shines it's like an

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.820 
where it really shines it's like an
above<00:04:32.280> average<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:33.030> blue<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:34.080> frightful

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
above average like blue like frightful

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.470 
above average like blue like frightful
so<00:04:34.980> we'll<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.310> like<00:04:35.340> body<00:04:35.790> damage<00:04:36.060> in<00:04:36.360> those

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
so we'll do like body damage in those

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.450 
so we'll do like body damage in those
two<00:04:36.690> playthroughs<00:04:37.110> leave<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.950> criticals<00:04:38.340> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
two playthroughs leave it criticals and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.740 
two playthroughs leave it criticals and
those<00:04:38.580> two<00:04:38.880> play<00:04:39.060> throughs<00:04:39.300> you'll<00:04:39.420> tear<00:04:39.660> them

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
those two play throughs you'll tear them

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.910 
those two play throughs you'll tear them
up<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.900> lot<00:04:40.050> faster<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:41.010> you've<00:04:41.250> ehm<00:04:42.200> I<00:04:43.200> really

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920

Purple's<00:05:18.470> yeah<00:05:19.470> this<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.160> something<00:05:20.370> that

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
Purple's yeah this is something that

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.360 
Purple's yeah this is something that
would<00:05:20.910> be<00:05:21.000> hard<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.330> pick<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.660> up<00:05:21.690> with

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
would be hard to pick you up with

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.620 
would be hard to pick you up with
because<00:05:23.370> you<00:05:23.520> know<00:05:23.640> you're<00:05:23.820> hip<00:05:23.940> firing<00:05:24.240> and

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
because you know you're hip firing and

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.450 
because you know you're hip firing and
you're<00:05:25.020> actually<00:05:25.169> packer<00:05:25.830> see<00:05:26.100> isn't<00:05:26.340> too

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
you're actually packer see isn't too

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.920 
you're actually packer see isn't too
good<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:26.850> you<00:05:26.910> can't<00:05:27.090> hit<00:05:27.180> those<00:05:27.390> those

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
good so you can't hit those those

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.950 
good so you can't hit those those
criticals<00:05:28.700> so<00:05:29.700> make<00:05:30.660> sure<00:05:30.690> they<00:05:30.870> have

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
criticals so make sure they have

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.480 
criticals so make sure they have
something<00:05:31.230> if<00:05:31.440> you<00:05:31.770> are<00:05:31.860> using<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:32.250> make

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
something if you are using this make

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.530 
something if you are using this make
sure<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.700> have<00:05:32.790> something<00:05:32.940> else<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.330> get<00:05:33.419> you

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
sure you have something else to get you

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.320 
sure you have something else to get you
up<00:05:33.660> with<00:05:33.840> like<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.080> had<00:05:34.200> my<00:05:34.350> infinity<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.700> that
