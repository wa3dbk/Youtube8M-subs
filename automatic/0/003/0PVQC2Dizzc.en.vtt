00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
shows and roz were drawing less than a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.390 
shows and roz were drawing less than a
hundred<00:06:24.289> people<00:06:24.590> and<00:06:24.710> we<00:06:24.860> didn't<00:06:25.070> know<00:06:25.190> if<00:06:25.280> the

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
hundred people and we didn't know if the

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.980 
hundred people and we didn't know if the
WWE<00:06:25.970> was<00:06:26.180> going<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.360> be<00:06:26.450> able<00:06:26.539> to<00:06:26.720> stay<00:06:26.870> alive

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
WWE was going to be able to stay alive

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.590 
WWE was going to be able to stay alive
and<00:06:27.440> that<00:06:27.620> was<00:06:27.800> a<00:06:27.830> mere<00:06:28.160> 20<00:06:28.550> years<00:06:28.820> ago<00:06:29.090> look<00:06:29.419> at

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
and that was a mere 20 years ago look at

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.390 
and that was a mere 20 years ago look at
where<00:06:29.780> they<00:06:29.990> are<00:06:30.200> now<00:06:30.440> when<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.650> think<00:06:30.950> back<00:06:31.190> to

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
where they are now when I think back to

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.969 
where they are now when I think back to
the<00:06:31.520> depths<00:06:31.970> of<00:06:32.120> despair<00:06:32.450> that<00:06:32.690> the<00:06:32.990> WWE<00:06:33.620> was

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
the depths of despair that the WWE was

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.690 
the depths of despair that the WWE was
in<00:06:34.310> in<00:06:34.510> 1994<00:06:35.510> you<00:06:35.930> fast<00:06:36.200> forward<00:06:36.560> to<00:06:36.620> 2014<00:06:37.280> and

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
in in 1994 you fast forward to 2014 and

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.800 
I look at that presentation that they
gave<00:06:39.770> in<00:06:39.889> Las<00:06:40.070> Vegas<00:06:40.340> unveiling<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.240> WWE

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
kind of

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.340
