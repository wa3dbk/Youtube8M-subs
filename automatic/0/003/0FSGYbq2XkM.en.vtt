00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 friends let's change the subject we're going 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.210
 to overturn also with motoring in 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.330
 terms of weeks elvio intensely 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 with the third reality of the cup or the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.820
 rally championship and doubles this in 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.710
 yahuarcocha important machines that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 they gave appointment there in various categories 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 Such is the case of being at a thousand 250 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.039
 cubic centimeters of daily concept 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.710
 maybe the biggest participation I say 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.740
 also up to 1550 cubic centimeters 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.750
 then up to 2000 cents 2 cents 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.719
 other axes that they put later were 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.180
 in the hand between the pilot 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 eduardo González herself and where the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.129
 great ataxia especially to inaugurate it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 gave in the category from 0 to 1250 where 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.940
 the presence of the car was here 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.649
 terms owners and villas benavídez de 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 realize that this competition is 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 cataloged as the most extreme of the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.260
 motorsport and that you have the option of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.840
 that the public can appreciate almost 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.270
 100% 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.190
 focused or located in the first 2 of 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.650
 the international battle zone because 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.570
 the author's intermediate was not this 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.390
 ribbon is so beautiful that you can 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.590
 appreciate from different sectors in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.310
 Regarding the presence of machines 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.800
 around 36 37 were there 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.570
 starting energy obviously there in 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.640
 states also with the quadrons of 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.670
 Perón also to attractions 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.920
 prototypes that ultimately give there the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.750
 feeling that they are going to see 0 is not 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.090
 so they have absolutely controlled 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.910
 pilots christian roses closed from same 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.920
 shield in the phototypes but those that 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.660
 better performance they had and thinking 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.340
 say each of the categories the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440
 places the locations were recorded 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.630
 so in the category from 0 to a thousand 250 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.580
 cubic centimeters the first place was 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.960
 for coach friends juniors second 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.180
 place for Luis Benavides and until that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.300
 place for am víctor quispe in the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.280
 membership category 151-1550 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.649
 cubic centimeters first put for 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.020
 mario ceballos on the subject of mario 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.880
 Ceballos turned his vehicle into what 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.670
 corresponded the first machine to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 the second one already had to be 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.439
 mechanical work in your vehicle and without 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.330
 However, it was able to recover and reached 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.190
 first place in this category the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.630
 capital then he was awarded the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.880
 first put in this third valid 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.160
 followed by Carlos Navarrete and he arrived 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.110
 day also worth noting that here in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.870
 this circuit of 3.5 points 6 in methods 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.489
 in short almost reaching 84 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.040
 kilometers are in the circuit of this 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.300
 track they split two machines turn the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.239
 best time is going by accessing 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.370
 classifying itself towards what is to go 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.750
 overcoming and even reaching 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.299
 determine which is the absolute winner 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.910
 and the track itself has also back 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.280
 but it 's 80 percent what 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.319
 corresponds there to earth 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 specifically , we can use 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.599
 different sectors according to also 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.310
 the cameras directed by part of 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.140
 our partner sebastián echeverría 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.610
 normally revises the categories in 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.069
 which corresponds to the chips and trucks 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.930
 there he highlighted the presence of Jorge Erazo 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.150
 while not all times that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.280
 we made a mention cristián zárate 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.620
 the absolute winner followed by them 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.870
 cuti and roberto posed and in the pictures is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.930
 again he returned the imbabureño cristian 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.329
 lopez to win this kind of competition 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.610
 and the receipts because he has won because he 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.530
 kept somewhat remote for a matter of 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.390
 100 final injuries reappears 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.489
 also in the first position in this 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.810
 first of the 13 that have been 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.000
 developed is the only one that has 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.859
 intervened and will have to look for the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.159
 championship in the two subsequent ones that 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.709
 are looming there we can appreciate a 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.709
 of the machines that was also 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.680
 looking for the best possible brand for 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.329
 be among the best and that dessert 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.670
 of would mean to be precisely 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.010
 filtering also attraction for our 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.170
 dear hobby that existed in form 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.480
 important in especially in the city of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.090
 videos in the surrounding sectors also 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.680
 of the safe track here see good 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.200
 amateur answers and it's a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.389
 motivating for the pilots in this way 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.030
 in such a way that this weekend 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.650
 could be taken into account 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.980
 the attraction and there as you can 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.350
 appreciate as it corresponds to this 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.060
 track has a tunnel was sometimes the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.190
 coincidence that a vehicle goes by 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.549
 above and another below and that's where 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.220
 you really feel the adrenaline of the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.160
 amateurs also when they appreciate this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.320
 kind of images good and if the same of 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.470
 this competition there we can appreciate already 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.630
 the presence and especially in the arrival 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.460
 to the goal by cristian lópez 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.370
 we go with the reactions 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.290
 corresponding of our pilots 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.169
 is super surprised the first time 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.090
 they invited me to this track is amazing 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.979
 the best clues that there are of reality 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.510
 here in the country I was telling you one of the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.860
 organizers that there is a track in quito 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.470
 very similar but that this is 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.120
 infinitely superior a little the floor 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.120
 A little bit knows but it 's amazing 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.380
 I also think it's really good that they continue 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.720
 increasing new type of activities 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:04.610
 nautical new options of what is the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:06.360
 rally dakar is a box of msx of 2009 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.880
 setback in the development of the 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.229
 competition is very smooth the part the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.419
 round the earth and almost gave me a 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.310
 trap nothing else that was to run with 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.289
 very careful because I was a little know 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.830
 the earth but there is an expedition I thought 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.139
 good the race itself is exciting the 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.880
 circuit is beautiful the car was a 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.490
 point since yesterday they were made 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.090
 things well and thanks to God today 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.190
 they gave the results not because 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.960
 the track was even a little 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.650
 damaged when we left the posts 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.330
 back but behind without any 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.610
 novelty we were all running very 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.940
 van reek is that he is teaching me to 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.070
 is to have a better level of 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.600
 competitiveness in what is accomplished me 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.130
 like the co-pilot who worked 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.350
 intensely also can not especially 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.260
 at the time of the curves clear it is the 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:58.010
 that helps to say right to left 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:01.520
 let's accelerate loosens in this is very 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.850
 closed very open but the pilot puts 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.820
 his part and the copilot is a 50-50 no 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.130
 it was a mistake in what is good the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.889
 boom but occurring between the curve a 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.060
 little fast and very bitten strictly 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.580
 the pupil hit the front 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.349
 and that made carlos and lift 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.550
 advantageously it was nothing we could not 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.939
 finish a little problem with the 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.599
 direction but let's go when this 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:27.889
 competition was a super good track 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.960
 are the best conditions a little 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.569
 the values ​​in some sectors but in 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.340
 very good conditions is demanding but 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.930
 not if it's a bit next a little bit 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.699
 technical by the slippery that is in 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.889
 some parts but in the championship 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.389
 How do you find which is the first 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.490
 run for health problems is what 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.319
 first that runs 10 valid losses 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.300
 earlier there are two more serious knit 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.590
 there you can recover if maybe yes 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.479
 can I can enter the goal still 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.669
 running back and running to see if 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.080
 I can become champion what comes next 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.150
 forward cristian apart from this 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.060
 good championship will keep running 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.800
 will dedicate me again to running the 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.930
 national cross and hard we hope nothing 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.430
 nor what is my strong good luck and 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.680
 only the fiction also that came the day 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.949
 from today the number many thanks for 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.949
 come
