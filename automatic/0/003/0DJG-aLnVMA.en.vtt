into the basket so the only way to get
it<00:02:59.810> out<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.230> use<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.770> super<00:03:01.130> mega<00:03:01.280> crazy

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
it out is to use like a super mega crazy

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.510 
it out is to use like a super mega crazy
extreme<00:03:02.240> punch<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.870> I've<00:03:03.830> spent<00:03:04.160> many<00:03:04.370> years

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
extreme punch and I've spent many years

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:20.140 
extreme punch and I've spent many years
honing<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.150> exact<00:03:05.630> skill

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.229 

the<00:03:20.599> ball<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.170> lightweight<00:03:22.000> kind<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.120> looks

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
the ball is lightweight kind of looks

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.369 
the ball is lightweight kind of looks
like<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.480> giant<00:03:23.720> cherry<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.840> also<00:03:27.019> says

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
like a giant cherry and it also says

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.160 
like a giant cherry and it also says
dunk<00:03:27.769> devil<00:03:28.160> on<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.519> which<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.569> guess<00:03:29.900> would<00:03:30.140> be

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
dunk devil on it which I guess would be

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.690 
dunk devil on it which I guess would be
an<00:03:30.349> indication<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.950> you're<00:03:31.370> supposed<00:03:31.640> to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
an indication that you're supposed to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.240 
an indication that you're supposed to
use<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.150> as<00:03:32.330> a<00:03:32.360> basketball

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250
