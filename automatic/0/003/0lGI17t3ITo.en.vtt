00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.270 

and<00:00:26.480> I'm<00:00:26.690> using<00:00:26.900> my<00:00:27.140> last<00:00:27.350> hair<00:00:27.680> extensions

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
and I'm using my last hair extensions

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.550 
and I'm using my last hair extensions
and<00:00:30.220> I'm<00:00:31.220> taking<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.940> smallest<00:00:32.630> two<00:00:33.020> sections

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
and I'm taking the smallest two sections

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.280 
and I'm taking the smallest two sections
and<00:00:34.040> I'm<00:00:34.430> clipping<00:00:34.730> one<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.390> top<00:00:35.570> of<00:00:35.810> another

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
and I'm clipping one on top of another

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.590 
and I'm clipping one on top of another
one<00:00:36.490> that<00:00:37.490> way<00:00:37.670> it<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:38.030> saves<00:00:39.010> me<00:00:40.150> less<00:00:41.150> clips

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
one that way it just saves me less clips

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:57.630 
one that way it just saves me less clips
to<00:00:41.989> put<00:00:42.980> in<00:00:43.130> my<00:00:43.280> head

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.280 

and<00:00:58.000> then<00:00:58.330> I'll<00:00:58.510> take<00:00:58.750> another<00:01:00.900> inch<00:01:01.900> or<00:01:02.080> half

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
and then I'll take another inch or half

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:12.230 
and then I'll take another inch or half
an<00:01:02.470> inch<00:01:02.650> section<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.490> then<00:01:03.640> do<00:01:04.150> my<00:01:04.330> next<00:01:04.660> clip

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.050 

sorry<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.500> pink<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:14.159> husband<00:01:14.670> decided

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
sorry about the pink my husband decided

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.300 
sorry about the pink my husband decided
to<00:01:15.210> spill<00:01:15.570> some<00:01:15.810> iterate<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.920> extensions

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.250 

so<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.240> clipped<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.110> my

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
so there you have it I clipped in all my

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.100 
so there you have it I clipped in all my
extensions<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.010> using<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.510> braid

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.630 

so<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.260> you'll<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.490> inch

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so then you'll take about an inch

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.540 
so then you'll take about an inch
section<00:01:33.210> right<00:01:33.660> under<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.140> ear<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> divide

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
section right under your ear and divide

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.359 
section right under your ear and divide
that<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.940> two<00:01:36.120> sections<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.050> we'll<00:01:38.040> start

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that into two sections and we'll start

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.320 
that into two sections and we'll start
braiding<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.660> Dutch<00:01:40.080> fishtail<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.240> taking<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
braiding a Dutch fishtail so taking the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:02:01.039 
braiding a Dutch fishtail so taking the
hair<00:01:42.600> under<00:01:43.290> instead<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> over

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.050 

and<00:02:02.049> as<00:02:02.469> always<00:02:02.680> once<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.280> get<00:02:03.520> about<00:02:03.759> three

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
and as always once I get about three

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.910 
and as always once I get about three
inches<00:02:04.360> down<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.899> start<00:02:05.289> pulling<00:02:05.590> my<00:02:05.680> braids

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
inches down I start pulling my braids

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.419 
inches down I start pulling my braids
apart<00:02:06.310> it's<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.119> easier<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.830> do<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.280> way

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
apart it's just easier to do it that way

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.280 
apart it's just easier to do it that way
instead<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:09.910> braiding<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> pulling<00:02:11.200> it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
instead of braiding it and pulling it

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.280 
instead of braiding it and pulling it
apart<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.980> feel<00:02:12.430> like<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.000> get<00:02:13.269> more<00:02:13.750> fullness

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
apart I feel like you get more fullness

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
apart I feel like you get more fullness
doing<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.400> way

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.620 

and<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.710> repeat<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.250> same<00:02:51.430> process<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:52.300> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
and just repeat the same process on the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:44.449 
and just repeat the same process on the
other<00:02:52.660> side

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.250 

so<00:03:45.459> once<00:03:45.670> you're<00:03:45.849> done<00:03:45.879> braiding<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.989> place

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
so once you're done braiding just place

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.880 
so once you're done braiding just place
it<00:03:47.290> where<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.980> would<00:03:48.519> like<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.879> pin<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.299> and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
it where you would like to pin it and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.759 
it where you would like to pin it and
grab<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> bobby<00:03:51.310> pin<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.140> secure<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.560> place

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
grab a bobby pin and secure it in place

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.410 
grab a bobby pin and secure it in place
and<00:03:55.860> repeat<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.040> same<00:03:57.250> process<00:03:57.430> once<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.209> get

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
and repeat the same process once you get

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:13.930 
and repeat the same process once you get
to<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.720> other<00:03:58.840> side

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.689
