00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
of stuff I get a back plate here it does

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.150 
of stuff I get a back plate here it does
intelsat<00:00:58.770> very<00:00:59.070> clearly<00:00:59.489> like<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.469> then

darn nicely awesome sleeve and then you
have<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:44.000> true<00:01:45.000> service<00:01:45.270> blows<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.869> aloes

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
have a true service blows the aloes

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
have a true service blows the aloes
noise<00:01:46.770> adapter<00:01:47.280> even<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:47.759> feel<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
noise adapter even I don't feel the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
noise adapter even I don't feel the
resistor<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.399> oh

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
resistor in there it's it's there oh

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
resistor in there it's it's there oh
that's<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:51.420> there<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.720> at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> end

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's right there it's at the end

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
that's right there it's at the end
what's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.970> party<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> those

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
what's a party you can see that those

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
what's a party you can see that those
are<00:01:54.990> sleeve<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.710> say<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.460> used

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
are sleeve and so not say like they used

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.810 
are sleeve and so not say like they used
to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.880> yeah<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> too<00:01:58.770> low<00:01:59.640> noise

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to be yeah and they have a too low noise

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 
to be yeah and they have a too low noise
adapters<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> plug<00:02:01.049> both<00:02:01.259> fans<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
adapters so you can plug both fans in to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880 
adapters so you can plug both fans in to
be<00:02:02.009> low<00:02:02.159> noise<00:02:03.170> really<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:04.439> they're<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
be low noise really yeah they're the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.289 
be low noise really yeah they're the
same<00:02:05.070> works<00:02:05.460> i<00:02:05.640> thought<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.000> was<00:02:06.030> more

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
same works i thought one was more

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.270 
same works i thought one was more
annoyed

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
annoyed

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.100 
annoyed
they're<00:02:07.549> not<00:02:07.640> labeled<00:02:07.880> any<00:02:08.209> differently<00:02:08.600> okay

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
they're not labeled any differently okay

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.199 
they're not labeled any differently okay
so<00:02:09.530> i'm<00:02:09.770> pretty<00:02:09.950> sure<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.310> same<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.910> wonder<00:02:11.120> if
