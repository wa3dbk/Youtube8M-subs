00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 eeeeh 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.130
 finally I know it was really bad 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.130
 because when you try to make a grid 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.510
 it is not 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.980
 why 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.400
 it does not seem to me that the cat sings three 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240
 is 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.570
 what exactly is the number four seconds away

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.439
 is called 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.019
 metal x 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.369
 defaulting 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.319
 that 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.049
 I found a couple of times a year 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.889

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.839
 look at the consistency ops 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.499

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.089

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.279

 vivastreet 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.529
 let's see if I find it in front 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.689
 It's just chocolate 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.729
 and of course if not very clever it is not that part 1 not convert 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.289
 directly to sky 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.569
 I thought they were good butterfly text x17 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.849
 I always go to a couple more 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.150

 we are alone chemistry yellow 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.929
 also this year a collective agreement was made 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.549
 already meaning 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.429
 why 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.429

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.439
 Mexico 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.439
 it is not like that of the mac for example giannotti 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.759
 this is because you are as you found yourself selling idol 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.569
 with the brush 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.229

 eyeshadow of a nice glass in white 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.509
 poor package 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.239
 this practically here 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.880
 I called you, I think what you are for the blackboard and what 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.169
 from one aspect 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.599
 now I love you 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.840

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.309
 I would say 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.639
 therefore rejected 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.909
 and then eye shadows of the 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.520
 worthwhile bench 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.240
 and I get up and advise me of the Cossacks 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.719
 the quality of one of these coins equal to the one they give you 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.120
 win to mac when a tt lines empoli 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.069
 mussels appetizer 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.650
 practically 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.779
 the water this is a leap to the poor 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.779

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.659

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.639
 backwardness 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.960
 this is the same amount as friends if you are part of it 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.820
 comparison between 2 part 4 here 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.910
 in which why vat and patty you have fc - what's his name 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.659
 the competition is square 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.740
 however the amount of product in the same 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.499
 and cost $ 9 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.689
 they virtually advertise it as super super super pigmented 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.419
 the trendy spirit of colors is forbidden 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.080
 get hurt though 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.809
 yes not only will they be transparent 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:43.789
 but I was expecting 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.059
 much more 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.059
 for the three starters as it was, it was not much better 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.059
 so this shop absolutely nothing against aids 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.199

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.969

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.499
 you would recommend anyone 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.629
 in this way we also avoid ita 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.360

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.479
