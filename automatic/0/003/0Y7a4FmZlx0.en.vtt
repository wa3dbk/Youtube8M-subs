00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.190
 we are in the very center of Kola 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.689
 the floor 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.849
 If you look at the Kola map then. 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.220
 Seidozero is in the center of it 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:28.669
 center points to you place in general of course 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.960
 instead of unique associated with legends 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:40.219
 with mystic still put sent here 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:43.520
 particular expedition Barchenko and others 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.320
 people who dealt with this topic for 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 in order to explore the possibility of influence 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.940
 shamans on people's minds and for some 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.030
 Barchuk sources took the material 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.749
 Stalin but naturally all his records 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.710
 all his diaries are classified and what 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:11.799
 their fate and what is the subsequent history 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.750
 studying we do not know but in particular about 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.240
 legends that are here at the local 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.080
 indigenous population which 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.080
 called themselves 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.310
 why for them is the lake considered sacred 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.910
 according to their legends, their ancestors saw how 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.760
 here from the ether these people materialize 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.730
 people were tall blond with 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:44.530
 blue eyes they were called 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:47.330
 arias they were very peaceful 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.950
 benevolent and settled out 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:56.510
 through the Karno gorge the variety settling along 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.090
 the mainland became communities and received 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.040
 local people how to lead 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 household 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:10.550
 thereby made a great contribution will 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.030
 what is most interesting is what is interesting 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.670
 still 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.530
 This place after expedition dyumin 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.110
 that took place here 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.410
 here she began to attract big 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.420
 number of people 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.080
 people come here looking for 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.110
 confirmation topics umeno someone wants 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.590
 conduct your research 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.590
 research but i want to tell you that sid 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.670
 again a unique place repeat 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:49.420
 once again a unique place it is not for everyone 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.420
 opens his secrets to talk about 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.960
 staying here with a group here 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.390
 practically say nothing because 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.970
 that once I was walking along everything 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.490
 before coming in through the womb and then going out 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.030
 through the pass to the ranks of the village of Revda here 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.520
 only then did I understand that when you go 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.850
 one here is then complete merger 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.600
 with nature because two people are 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:28.489
 already on the go it's just time 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:33.980
 stay transmittal in nature 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:38.540
 that is, those mysteries that are here 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.310
 opens in a group well anyway 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:47.840
 I hardly heard them 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:50.290
 got if we talk about my my 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.420
 expedition it can be called expedition 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:59.269
 During this period, I watched a lot 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.430
 interesting phenomena there is an island 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.820
 which are called grave island or 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.500
 He also Saami called the island 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:12.980
 white deer is rita 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:16.310
 the place where the rituals were held nature 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.820
 on on this island as well as here on 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.000
 cedia 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.440
 she is unique in terms of what's here 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.890
 have all the plants that are average 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.370
 strip 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:34.289
 here there is currant raspberry honeysuckle 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:38.180
 a violet bird cherry 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:41.279
 and the fern is taller than a man here 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.539
 trees are not characteristic of the weight of the tundra 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:46.439
 that is, they have huge trunks and 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:52.680
 high growth 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:56.789
 not like a moore then dreamur 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.919
 in on the kola peninsula so here on 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.919
 this island of white deer 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.360
 sitting resting watching the weather 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.180
 was smart 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:16.279
 great cloudless sky clear and 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.099
 a ball suddenly appears at the end of the island 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:23.789
 neon well size somewhere here a little bit 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.499
 more basketball and naturally 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.020
 I was wondering what it could be 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:31.229
 the brain in one second gave a million 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.419
 versions at first I thought that someone 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.889
 turned on the spotlight then I realized that 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.479
 This may not be the route is not here 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:42.209
 no communications for this phenomenon 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.490
 then when I began to observe 

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:46.680
 He did not move nothing more than just depends 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.360
 consisted at one point when I became 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.209
 observe and listen to your 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.849
 feelings about this object 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:57.229
 I felt the state of the body as 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:00.800
 with increased pressure i.e. 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:08.189
 some bitter taste in the mouth and 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:10.889
 pulsing veins then he also like 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:14.009
 appeared just disappeared nowhere that is he 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.680
 did not move he did not arise never 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.319
 rather did not come from where he just 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.699
 originated in one place like this 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:24.029
 arose so he disappeared 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:27.089
 I have a lot of events here 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.619
 happened interesting once drove 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:32.809
 here 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:35.729
 a botanist from dresden we come to the seat 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:39.899
 the weather was basically normal wear 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:42.840
 boiled on the water was what was on the lake what was 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:48.570
 and imagine 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:52.260
 the wave goes spiraling and 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.949
 and spiral rainbow pillar when we saw 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.050
 this phenomenon we are naturally stunned and 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:03.180
 when they saw that this is not the only one 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.440
 here's the type of flower the whole club here of these 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.680
 rainbow pillars 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.419
 with wrapped waves of course a sight 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.270
 it was impressive 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:16.560
 but without even knowing the witnesses we are with him 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.830
 and even tried to shoot on camera 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:27.260
 I really do not know, I did not succeed, but he 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:27.260
 left and didn't tell me about it
