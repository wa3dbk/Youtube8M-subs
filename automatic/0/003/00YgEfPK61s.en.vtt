00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.170
 hello friend subscribers and new 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.440
 visitors in this video we will see 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.600
 how to update to android 5.1.1 on 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.940
 our experience 3 and mushroom 2 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.920
 respectively this week has 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.920
 released the official update for 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.070
 these terminals and good in this video 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.340
 let's see how to do it first 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.710
 the first way to do it is by going to 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.280
 software settings and 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.280
 let's see in passing that here I have the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.199
 Android version 5 points 0.2 and that 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.590
 I'm also in a rom that 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.890
 existing in compilation 23.1 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.540
 point-to-point 1.28 when the first 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.720
 option is to say adjustments about 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.000
 phone and update and so do not make them 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.500
 who does not mean that he does not have a 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.240
 operator or they still do not get the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.940
 update via ota and they will have to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.119
 wait for the second way to update 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.160
 is by flash tool I will leave a link in the 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.600
 video description of how to update 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.119
 by flash tool 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 with the corresponding firmware and good 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.690
 and the third option is for those 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.490
 we have root and recovery already know that 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890
 when they have root and recovery they do not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 update via ota we have to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.100
 update through a racked rom 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.600
 so as not to lose the rooney in recovery like this 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.600
 that I 'm going to head to the recovery 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.640
 to be able to pose the surrounded break 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.710
 of the new compilation 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.920
 this is necessary so as not to lose 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.170
 recovery you know what we pay for the mobile 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.540
 and enter to recovery pressing the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.540
 key + repeated months 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.260
 well we are already in recovery 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.160
 and the first thing we are going to do is the 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.989
 whites before installing a room always 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.150
 you have to make the guayos of 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.060
 preference has to be full waves 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.170
 so we're going to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.170
 water ex forgiveness 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.980
 white advanced wipe and let's do 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.980
 filewile dabill cache 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.280
 the data and cache the three that I've 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.040
 selected and we will give you white 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.379
 white like this the process is going to take 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.450
 a little bit like that is that I'm going to cut the 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.540
 video 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.460
 and we will come back again after 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.680
 finish the process 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.240
 and the process is finished and then use 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.980
 go back here back 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.380
 to a point if they do not want to lose 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.050
 its applications only to white caches 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.500
 and cache and they would just give it is cool 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.960
 but this I do not recommend it always do 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.510
 full whites including the data because 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.690
 to make it a clean installation like this 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.650
 is that now we are going to history 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.980
 we selected in the part above 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.840
 where the route surrounded is stored 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.560
 we look for the rubric I only have the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.030
 external memory of the selection 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.550
 and I give you swap with flash 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.530
 in the same way I'm going to wait for 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.850
 finish the process I will cut the video 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.850
 this takes a little 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.420
 you are going to wait for the necessary clear 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.069
 I'm going to finish the process and to 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.069
 finalize we give you the reboot system 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.090
 and we would only have to wait for 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.180
 the phone turns on that it will take a 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.650
 little bit 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.629
 because it takes a while to turn on 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.150
 phone because we are doing full 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.370
 waves in my case has not delayed any of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.079
 6 minutes this is so I do not know 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.709
 despair if you do not turn on have 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.480
 what to expect the necessary time 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.420
 and I'm going to cut the video like I said 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.610
 good already started in safe mode 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.729
 I started not know why but not 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.469
 worry what's important is that it started 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.599
 As you can see in the bottom part there is 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.819
 a message in German that says modes 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.059
 insurance simply choose your language will 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:45.150
 to the next following next or if 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:48.029
 you want you can configure your connection 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.520
 wifi and your gmail account or as you wish 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.520
 I'm going to omit all these things 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:06.369
 we are already going 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.369
 and there we have access to the launcher 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.680
 I pass, we give a revised the new 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.680
 icons 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.000
 the new the woman who has changed are 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.740
 few changes but it has changed 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.740
 I'm going to put it in the Soviet 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.310
 and now it will not direct adjustments 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.960
 so that it comes right about the phone 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.000
 that I already have a version 5.1.1 with the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.720
 last compilation number that starts 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.720
 in 23 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.660
 in the same way now let's review 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.660
 that we have root access 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.930
 here is the shooter app that 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.180
 and we see that it is working 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.979
 correctly 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.510
 now the recovery also in the 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.920
 application n of reuters 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.380
 We see that it is active we give it the 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.450
 root permission we choose the recovery that 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.720
 we like it and in the second one it's 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.880
 default and I'll give you reboot your 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.900
 first color thread and to access the 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.720
 recovery 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.970
 we will give in accept and this is for 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.400
 that they see that we have both the root and 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.240
 recovery we have not lost him continue 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.490
 keeping in 5.1.1 because we have 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.320
 precious to the peloteada rom that is the 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.840
 only way to keep root and 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.670
 recovery so let's check 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.300
 we press where it goes 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.300
 the most key 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.319
 repeatedly and we see that we already have 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.360
 access to recovery project and good this 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.909
 it would be all friends do not forget to comment
