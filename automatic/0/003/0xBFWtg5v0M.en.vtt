have<00:02:43.560> audio<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.459> streaming<00:02:44.909> again<00:02:45.359> in<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
have audio I'm streaming again in the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.940 
have audio I'm streaming again in the
air<00:02:45.720> indicator<00:02:46.019> light<00:02:46.409> and<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.769> showing

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
air indicator light and it's showing

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.270 
air indicator light and it's showing
laser<00:02:47.370> error<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> LCD<00:02:48.480> display<00:02:49.040> now<00:02:50.040> we're

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
laser error on the LCD display now we're

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.629 
laser error on the LCD display now we're
gonna<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:51.390> pounded<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.230> laser<00:02:52.639> and

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
gonna get pounded I to the laser and

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.290 
gonna get pounded I to the laser and
shut<00:02:53.879> off<00:02:54.030> our<00:02:54.209> audio<00:02:54.569> line

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.830 

Shh<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:59.560> it's<00:03:00.130> off<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:01.330> now<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.540> can

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
Shh there it's off now and now you can

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.570 
Shh there it's off now and now you can
see<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.410> system<00:03:02.800> temperatures<00:03:03.280> are

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
see that the system temperatures are

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.640 
see that the system temperatures are
seen<00:03:03.970> again<00:03:04.300> now<00:03:04.900> we're<00:03:05.110> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.380> simulate

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
seen again now we're going to simulate

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.230 
seen again now we're going to simulate
the<00:03:05.980> effect<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.550> an<00:03:07.330> alignment<00:03:07.630> air<00:03:08.020> on<00:03:08.260> our

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
the effect of an alignment air on our

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.560 
the effect of an alignment air on our
sensor<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.920> purpose<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.460> this<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.360> we

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
sensor the purpose of this is so that we

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.200 
sensor the purpose of this is so that we
don't<00:03:13.720> capture<00:03:14.550> inappropriate<00:03:15.550> samples<00:03:16.000> for

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
don't capture inappropriate samples for

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.530 
don't capture inappropriate samples for
our<00:03:16.300> data<00:03:16.510> processing<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.940> register<00:03:19.420> an

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
our data processing and we register an

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.540 
our data processing and we register an
error<00:03:19.690> signal<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> LCD<00:03:20.770> display<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.520> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
user that the machine needs to be

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.430 
user that the machine needs to be
realigned<00:03:24.490> as<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.330> can<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.780> LCD<00:03:26.140> display

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
realigned as you can see the LCD display

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.910 
realigned as you can see the LCD display
is<00:03:26.620> limited<00:03:27.100> here<00:03:27.130> for<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> user

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.059 

okay<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.060> purpose<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.750> video

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
okay and the purpose of this video

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.470 
okay and the purpose of this video
demonstration<00:03:37.069> is<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.880> be<00:03:38.000> looking<00:03:38.360> at

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
demonstration is to be looking at

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.589 
demonstration is to be looking at
superfluous<00:03:39.200> signals<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.040> air<00:03:40.520> gap<00:03:40.849> which

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
superfluous signals in the air gap which

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.979 
superfluous signals in the air gap which
might<00:03:41.930> cause<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:42.680> beam<00:03:43.640> cut<00:03:43.880> operation<00:03:44.569> and

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
might cause a beam cut operation and

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.010 
might cause a beam cut operation and
cutting<00:03:45.319> off<00:03:45.410> laser<00:03:45.950> beam<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.459> our<00:03:46.610> sensor<00:03:47.060> so

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
cutting off laser beam to our sensor so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.600 
cutting off laser beam to our sensor so
we<00:03:48.200> have<00:03:48.319> these<00:03:48.500> sparks<00:03:48.950> being<00:03:49.220> generated

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
we have these sparks being generated

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.430 
we have these sparks being generated
that<00:03:50.000> exactly<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.750> same<00:03:50.959> height<00:03:51.170> as<00:03:51.319> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
that exactly the same height as the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.680 
that exactly the same height as the
laser<00:03:51.620> beam<00:03:51.980> now<00:03:52.880> if<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.120> turn<00:03:53.270> on<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.510> lights

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
laser beam now if we turn on the lights

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.840 
laser beam now if we turn on the lights
to<00:03:53.900> look<00:03:54.050> at<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.230> apparatus<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:55.520> can<00:03:55.640> see

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
to look at this apparatus you can see

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.670 
to look at this apparatus you can see
that<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.569> charging<00:03:57.050> plates<00:03:57.319> and

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
that this is the charging plates and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.490 
that this is the charging plates and
that's<00:03:57.860> our<00:03:58.069> nice<00:03:58.489> little<00:03:58.520> alignment<00:03:59.270> and

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
that's our nice little alignment and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.350 
that's our nice little alignment and
here's<00:04:00.500> our<00:04:00.680> laser<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.280> front<00:04:01.550> of<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.730> we<00:04:02.209> look

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
here's our laser in front of it we look

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.940 
here's our laser in front of it we look
at<00:04:02.480> our<00:04:02.600> laser<00:04:02.840> here<00:04:03.260> we<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.680> see<00:04:03.830> that

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
at our laser here we can see that

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.830 
at our laser here we can see that
everything<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.760> fine<00:04:05.060> with<00:04:05.300> our<00:04:05.420> system

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
everything is just fine with our system

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.840 
everything is just fine with our system
we<00:04:06.019> have<00:04:06.050> registered<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:06.950> machine<00:04:07.280> cut<00:04:07.580> by

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
we have registered a machine cut by

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.930 
we have registered a machine cut by
these<00:04:08.060> sparks<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:10.010> now<00:04:10.160> I'm<00:04:10.310> going<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.519> take<00:04:10.760> my

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
these sparks so now I'm going to take my

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.400 
these sparks so now I'm going to take my
hand<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.390> put<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:11.870> front<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.110> this<00:04:12.170> laser

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
hand and put it in front of this laser

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.000 
hand and put it in front of this laser
and<00:04:12.799> cause<00:04:13.790> kind<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.560> asynchronous<00:04:15.560> events

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
and cause kind of asynchronous events

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.310 
and cause kind of asynchronous events
with<00:04:16.459> cutting<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.060> laser<00:04:17.450> at<00:04:17.870> weird<00:04:18.200> times

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
with cutting this laser at weird times

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.310 
with cutting this laser at weird times
and<00:04:18.919> just<00:04:18.950> doing<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.609> for<00:04:19.760> fun<00:04:19.820> basically<00:04:20.570> and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
and just doing it for fun basically and

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.080 
and just doing it for fun basically and
this<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.590> basically<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.250> simulate<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.850> fact

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
this is basically to simulate the fact

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.629 
this is basically to simulate the fact
that<00:04:23.240> with<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.050> rotor<00:04:24.229> vibrating<00:04:24.919> so<00:04:25.160> much<00:04:25.370> in

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
that with the rotor vibrating so much in

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.360 
that with the rotor vibrating so much in
the<00:04:25.940> machine<00:04:26.330> sometimes<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.229> can<00:04:27.380> move<00:04:28.010> over

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
the machine sometimes it can move over

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.460 
the machine sometimes it can move over
and<00:04:28.669> cut<00:04:29.240> off<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.570> beam<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.169> wouldn't

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and cut off the beam and that wouldn't

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.409 
and cut off the beam and that wouldn't
necessarily<00:04:30.560> be<00:04:31.100> from<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.940> rotor<00:04:32.180> bars

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
necessarily be from the rotor bars

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.810 
necessarily be from the rotor bars
cutting<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:33.229> it<00:04:33.350> could<00:04:33.470> may<00:04:33.620> actually<00:04:33.820> be

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
cutting it but it could may actually be

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.840 
cutting it but it could may actually be
from<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.180> movement<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.810> machine<00:04:36.850> so

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
from the movement of the machine so

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.659 
from the movement of the machine so
machines<00:04:38.720> not<00:04:38.990> registering<00:04:39.500> an<00:04:39.650> alarm<00:04:39.950> now

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
machines not registering an alarm now

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.100 
machines not registering an alarm now
what<00:04:40.970> we're<00:04:41.120> going<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.300> do<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.600> we're<00:04:41.840> going<00:04:41.990> to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.650 
what we're going to do is we're going to
get<00:04:42.919> our<00:04:43.070> fan<00:04:43.310> going<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.910> try<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:44.330> see<00:04:44.539> if<00:04:44.600> we
