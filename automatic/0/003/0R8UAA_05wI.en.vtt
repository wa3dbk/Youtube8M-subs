at<00:00:20.220> ultimate<00:00:20.910> AG<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.990> practice<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> push

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
at ultimate AG we practice the push

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.210 
at ultimate AG we practice the push
hands<00:00:23.010> method<00:00:23.460> taught<00:00:23.850> by<00:00:24.180> Changmin<00:00:24.660> Cheng

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
hands method taught by Changmin Cheng

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.849 
hands method taught by Changmin Cheng
this<00:00:26.220> method<00:00:26.670> uses<00:00:27.000> four<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> 37<00:00:28.349> postures

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this method uses four of the 37 postures

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.810 
this method uses four of the 37 postures
from<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> far<00:00:29.510> ward<00:00:30.510> off<00:00:30.869> roll<00:00:31.230> back<00:00:32.070> press

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
from the far ward off roll back press

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.080 
from the far ward off roll back press
and<00:00:33.239> push<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:34.829> purpose<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> exercise<00:00:35.640> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and push the purpose of the exercise is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.389 
and push the purpose of the exercise is
to<00:00:36.420> feel<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.960> intention<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.829> energy<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to feel the intention and energy of the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
to feel the intention and energy of the
other<00:00:38.489> person<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.719> order<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> neutralize

their pushes without becoming unbalanced

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.130 
their pushes without becoming unbalanced
ourselves<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.340> respond<00:00:45.000> feeling<00:00:45.870> for

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
ourselves we then respond feeling for

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
ourselves we then respond feeling for
tension<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.739> emptiness<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:48.059> make

involves learning the push hand sequence

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
involves learning the push hand sequence
with<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> partner<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.060> key<00:01:18.330> ideas<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.960> as

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
encourages the waist to turn deflecting

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
encourages the waist to turn deflecting
the<00:01:25.320> pushes<00:01:25.770> coming<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> other<00:01:26.490> person

the pushes coming from the other person
second<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.530> arms<00:01:28.829> should<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.220> soft<00:01:29.549> as

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
second the arms should be as soft as

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.450 
second the arms should be as soft as
possible<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> sensitivity<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
possible so we have the sensitivity to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.760 
possible so we have the sensitivity to
feel<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.030> person<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.600> doing<00:01:33.770> felt

the spine should be kept as straight as

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
the spine should be kept as straight as
possible<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.100> remain<00:01:38.369> rooted<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
possible so we can remain rooted and

possible so we can remain rooted and
balanced<00:01:40.340> push<00:01:41.340> hands<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> often<00:01:42.150> thought<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
balanced push hands is often thought of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960 
balanced push hands is often thought of
as<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.049> martial<00:01:43.500> component<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.100> Taiji<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
as the martial component of Taiji but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
as the martial component of Taiji but
its<00:01:45.090> application<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.170> wider<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
its application is much wider by

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.639 
its application is much wider by
practicing<00:01:48.119> push<00:01:48.329> hands<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:49.290> come<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
practicing push hands we come to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
practicing push hands we come to
understand<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> value<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.180> opposing

understand the value of not opposing

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.800 
understand the value of not opposing
force<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.530> force<00:01:52.759> instead<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.210> try<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
force with force instead we try to be

force with force instead we try to be
sensitive<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.860> where<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> energy<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> push

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
sensitive to where the energy of a push

sensitive to where the energy of a push
is<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.780> help<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.469> its<00:01:58.500> way

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
then we respond with discernment to push

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.170 
then we respond with discernment to push
