00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
vmware fusion works with with mac OS and

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
vmware fusion works with with mac OS and
an<00:00:31.289> autocad<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.700> don't<00:00:32.880> show<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.059> how

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
an autocad but they don't show you how

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.610

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
want to use instead of your escape key

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.250 
want to use instead of your escape key
then<00:02:14.810> 22<00:02:15.640> now<00:02:16.640> here's<00:02:17.209> here<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.050> problem

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
then 22 now here's here is the problem

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.160 
then 22 now here's here is the problem
that<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> had<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.790> can't<00:02:20.090> actually<00:02:20.390> press<00:02:20.989> your

that I had you can't actually press your
escape<00:02:21.350> key<00:02:21.739> because<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.640> doesn't<00:02:23.000> work

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
escape key because it just doesn't work

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.840 
escape key because it just doesn't work
it<00:02:23.720> won't<00:02:23.930> register<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.190> what<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.430> have<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.730> do

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.009 
tab and then press escape then you get
it<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.709> press<00:02:33.920> ok<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.760> that's<00:02:35.239> all<00:02:35.600> you

need to do VMware works quite well with

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.680 
need to do VMware works quite well with
AutoCAD<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.489> I'd<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.239> say<00:02:41.420> though<00:02:41.660> that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
AutoCAD and I'd like to say though that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.560 
AutoCAD and I'd like to say though that
it<00:02:42.200> takes<00:02:42.410> quite<00:02:42.680> some<00:02:42.890> time<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.280> start<00:02:43.489> up<00:02:43.670> so

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
it takes quite some time to start up so

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.210 
it takes quite some time to start up so
when<00:02:44.780> you're<00:02:44.900> starting<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.440> windows<00:02:45.769> it

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
when you're starting up your windows it

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.860 
when you're starting up your windows it
does<00:02:46.580> take<00:02:46.760> quite<00:02:46.880> some<00:02:47.120> time<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.330> start<00:02:47.690> up

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
does take quite some time to start up

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.199

you're<00:02:52.519> in<00:02:52.760> AutoCAD<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.660> should<00:02:53.959> work<00:02:54.110> fine<00:02:54.380> I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
you're in AutoCAD it should work fine I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.140 
you're in AutoCAD it should work fine I

offline<00:03:12.380> messages<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.070> stuff<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:13.940> quite

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
offline messages and stuff so it's quite

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.390 
offline messages and stuff so it's quite
annoying<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.110> don't<00:03:15.320> get<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.920> messages

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
annoying and you don't get the messages

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.069 
annoying and you don't get the messages
that<00:03:16.430> people<00:03:16.700> send<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.480> when<00:03:17.630> you're<00:03:17.780> offline

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
that people send you when you're offline

so i get it that I've had to happen that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.810 
so i get it that I've had to happen that
you<00:03:21.200> go<00:03:21.380> into<00:03:21.620> windows<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.400> then<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:22.640> have

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
you go into windows and then you have

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.150 
you go into windows and then you have
about<00:03:23.180> 20<00:03:23.720> messages<00:03:24.170> from<00:03:24.320> people<00:03:24.500> we<00:03:24.980> think

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
about 20 messages from people we think

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.569 
about 20 messages from people we think
you<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.549> receive<00:03:25.940> them<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:27.130> with<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> DM<00:03:28.459> you

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
you can receive them so with a DM you

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.000 
you can receive them so with a DM you
can<00:03:28.820> it's<00:03:29.150> just<00:03:29.360> quite<00:03:29.570> handy<00:03:29.930> it's<00:03:30.620> free<00:03:30.859> as

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
can it's just quite handy it's free as

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.240

have<00:03:38.720> any<00:03:38.960> questions<00:03:39.410> just<00:03:39.560> ask<00:03:39.830> me<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:42.020> I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
have any questions just ask me the I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.460 
have any questions just ask me the I
have<00:03:43.070> four<00:03:43.340> gigabytes<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.910> RAM<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.600> 2.4

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
have four gigabytes of RAM and 2.4

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.090 
have four gigabytes of RAM and 2.4
gigahertz<00:03:45.530> dual-core<00:03:46.750> macbook<00:03:47.750> pro<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.410> would

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
gigahertz dual-core macbook pro I would

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.190 
gigahertz dual-core macbook pro I would
recommend<00:03:49.430> getting<00:03:49.970> 4<00:03:50.420> gigabytes<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.959> RAM

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
recommend getting 4 gigabytes of RAM

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.510 
recommend getting 4 gigabytes of RAM
though<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.440> do<00:03:51.590> not<00:03:51.770> think<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.310> will<00:03:52.490> work

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
though I do not think it will work

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.410 
though I do not think it will work
properly<00:03:52.910> on<00:03:53.209> 2<00:03:53.510> gigabytes<00:03:53.990> but<00:03:54.790> yeah<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:56.030> can

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
properly on 2 gigabytes but yeah I can

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.320 
properly on 2 gigabytes but yeah I can
easily<00:03:56.930> draw<00:03:57.140> with<00:03:57.350> this<00:03:57.530> now<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.310> can't<00:03:59.030> show

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
easily draw with this now I can't show

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.130 
easily draw with this now I can't show
you<00:03:59.360> because<00:04:01.030> since<00:04:02.030> i'm<00:04:02.209> recording<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.900> takes

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
you because since i'm recording it takes

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.050 
you because since i'm recording it takes
up<00:04:03.320> too<00:04:03.440> much<00:04:03.470> processing<00:04:04.190> power<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.670> it's

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
up too much processing power and it's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.330 
up too much processing power and it's
too<00:04:05.600> laggy<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:07.150> any<00:04:08.150> questions<00:04:08.330> just<00:04:09.100> send<00:04:10.100> it

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
too laggy so any questions just send it

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.160 
too laggy so any questions just send it
to<00:04:10.370> me<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.640> i'll<00:04:11.209> try<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.630> get<00:04:11.750> back<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.080> you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
to me and i'll try and get back to you

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.720 
to me and i'll try and get back to you
hopefully<00:04:13.040> this<00:04:13.220> was<00:04:13.400> useful<00:04:13.820> ok
