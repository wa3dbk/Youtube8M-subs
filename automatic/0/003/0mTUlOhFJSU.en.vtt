00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 we do not have a camera a camera a camera 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.179
 overheats a lot not to shoot at all 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 it can not be turned off all so well the system 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.560
 such that be sure to go out with 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.650
 division into divisions because we allow 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.359
 we have planned now on this will be 13 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.400
 car flute necessarily 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.890
 jump to the division must go for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.130
 division and go on division now now 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.109
 demagnetized coupling 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 and moving exactly 1 division on our 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.489
 step all over again she is put on a magnet and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.489
 went backwards. 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.200
 Here's the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.220
 at 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 where just what is it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.750
 The above spoke in these buttons not 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.750
 you will understand the very understood 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 or leads calmly 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.099
 we 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.580
 chose the easiest option because 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.280
 what we don't have is not worth it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.040
 task 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.969
 products 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.969
 home for yourself then 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.280
 on fig they will show 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.360
 pallies. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.830
 you can put any cutters 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.910
 she somehow got used to that so kawai 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.910
 first though in theory 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.680
 and about primitive works 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.920
 write a program at the cottage form it 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.240
 pretty difficult 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.550
 sue day customer 1 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.810
 another client needs everything all differently 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.270
 everyone has picky wives who 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.540
 make comic 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.540
 design projects they fill 1 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.400
 simpler 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.130
 with lifting back limits here on here 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.050
 this machine at least performs 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.510
 caprices 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.640
 By the way this router can work as 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.360
 Spears dead body mode 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.520
 start turning modes 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.310
 then 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.880
 only keys turning mode and defreeze 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.880
 the president 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.200
 lathe 1 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.800
 perform 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.800
 behind 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.959
 it is very good at infection rolling 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.500
 for turning work but this is divided 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.100
 works for frezer it 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.100
 perfect fight 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.319
 how to say on this machine at home 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.790
 but 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.790
 when here especially 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.980
 beautiful that once Putin is either on 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.460
 but on the contrary it is necessary and it 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.930
 at 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.259
 not air in 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.259
 as I think 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.230
 you now bye cameras 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.230
 loads 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.350
 show the compass actually look 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.350
 what makes whites 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.080
 the last 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.530
 signal from such 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.530
 someone 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.070
 and your holiday to become them and first to 4 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.530
 you just need to pass 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.120
 turning is now not 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.639
 ground billet 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.840
 flutes are cut then them 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.840
 do you grind through 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.820
 co it is desirable to do
