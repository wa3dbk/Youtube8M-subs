now in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.560 
now in this video I'm going to show you
how<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> clean<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.590> canon<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.250> HP<00:00:12.059> print<00:00:12.420> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
how to clean the canon and HP print is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.829 
how to clean the canon and HP print is
these<00:00:13.200> are<00:00:13.469> thermal<00:00:13.889> print<00:00:14.190> heads

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
these are thermal print heads

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.370 
these are thermal print heads
they<00:00:15.839> almost<00:00:16.080> look<00:00:16.440> identical<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> they're

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
they almost look identical so they're

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.939 
they almost look identical so they're
going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> clean<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.039> basically<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> same<00:00:21.060> way

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
going to clean it basically the same way

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.550 
going to clean it basically the same way
now<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.130> happens<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> these<00:00:23.850> print<00:00:24.240> heads

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
now what happens to these print heads

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.900 
now what happens to these print heads
there<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.680> thermal<00:00:25.890> printed<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> if<00:00:26.730> they're

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
there are thermal printed and if they're

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
there are thermal printed and if they're
not<00:00:27.029> used<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.810> where<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.529> printer<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
not used or it's where the printer is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.769 
not used or it's where the printer is
not<00:00:29.070> set<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.699> best<00:00:29.910> printing<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> time

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
not set for best printing all the time

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.110 
not set for best printing all the time
these<00:00:31.410> little<00:00:31.740> nozzles<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.840> clog<00:00:33.840> up

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
these little nozzles can clog up

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
these little nozzles can clog up
especially<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.630> using<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.260> now

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
especially if you're not using it now

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.470 
especially if you're not using it now
the<00:00:38.340> first<00:00:38.579> thing<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
we're going to remove the little gasket

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.840 
we're going to remove the little gasket
from<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> printhead

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
from the printhead

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.299 
from the printhead
like<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.000> said<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.750> HP<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.230> canon<00:00:46.739> are

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
like I said the HP and canon are

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.529 
like I said the HP and canon are
basically<00:00:48.030> identical<00:00:48.920> now<00:00:50.149> what<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
do get a little cup of hot water sit the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
do get a little cup of hot water sit the
chemical<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.449> thing<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.660> want

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
chemical in it the other thing you want

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.830 
chemical in it the other thing you want
to<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.489> layer<00:00:59.969> I'll

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to do is get a can of this layer I'll

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
to do is get a can of this layer I'll
show<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> how<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> work<00:01:01.770> that's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
show you how that's going to work that's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.410 
show you how that's going to work that's
going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> help<00:01:03.090> flush<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.960> print<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
going to help flush out that print it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
going to help flush out that print it
also<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.760> little<00:01:08.810> cup<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.110> lid<00:01:11.030> where<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
also have a little cup or lid where I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
also have a little cup or lid where I
can<00:01:12.270> set<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> printhead<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> let<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> soak

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
can set the printhead in and let it soak

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.330 
can set the printhead in and let it soak
for<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> while<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> probably<00:01:16.770> need<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> pair<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
for a while you probably need a pair of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
for a while you probably need a pair of
needlenose<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> take

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
needlenose so you can go in and take

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.429 
needlenose so you can go in and take
those<00:01:20.299> gaskets<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.780> took<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
those gaskets they just took out all the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109 
those gaskets they just took out all the
gaskets<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> reason<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.430> taking<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
gaskets the reason I'm taking them out I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.580 
gaskets the reason I'm taking them out I
don't<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:24.930> down<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> drain

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
don't want them to go down the drain

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.800 
don't want them to go down the drain
when<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> sink<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> clean<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
when I take it to the sink to clean it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
when I take it to the sink to clean it
out<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> wise<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.640> there

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
out so it's wise to take them out there

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.289 
out so it's wise to take them out there
again<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> HP<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.400> Canon<00:01:32.790> print<00:01:33.000> heads<00:01:33.180> are

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
again the HP the Canon print heads are

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.090 
again the HP the Canon print heads are
the<00:01:33.420> same

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the same

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
the same
now<00:01:35.100> once<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.759> chemicals<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.049> little

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
now once the chemicals or the little

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310 
now once the chemicals or the little
tray<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.960> micro<00:01:39.960> screens

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
tray a little bit on the micro screens

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
tray a little bit on the micro screens
let<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> soak<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> while<00:01:42.270> maybe<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
let it soak there for a while maybe a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.069 
let it soak there for a while maybe a
half-hour<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.630> only<00:01:45.780> time<00:01:45.840> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
half-hour now this the only time you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.420 
half-hour now this the only time you
have<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.100> use<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
have to do this if you don't use the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
have to do this if you don't use the
printer<00:01:47.700> line<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.930> set<00:01:49.290> your

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
printer line or you don't set your

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.999 
printer line or you don't set your
printing<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.909> quality<00:01:51.479> printing<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.799> these

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
printing to quality printing then these

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.660 
printing to quality printing then these
nozzles<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.409> clog<00:01:55.409> up

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.480 

now<00:02:02.210> once<00:02:02.510> I'm<00:02:03.380> completed<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.250> I'll

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
now once I'm completed with this I'll

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.880 
now once I'm completed with this I'll
take<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.790> over<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.120> sink<00:02:05.479> I'll<00:02:06.080> be<00:02:06.500> able<00:02:06.650> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
take it over to the sink I'll be able to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.639 
take it over to the sink I'll be able to
use<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.190> can<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.640> air<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:09.080> flush<00:02:09.410> out

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
use this can of air to really flush out

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.520 
use this can of air to really flush out
those<00:02:10.270> now<00:02:11.270> I'll<00:02:11.330> take<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.780> print<00:02:12.050> head<00:02:12.230> over

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
those now I'll take the print head over
