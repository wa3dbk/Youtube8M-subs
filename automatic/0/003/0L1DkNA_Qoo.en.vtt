cards this device storage access can be
really<00:01:26.640> handy<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> when<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> look<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.860> there

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
really handy so when you look in there

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
really handy so when you look in there
you're<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.880> DCIM<00:01:30.750> folder<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you're gonna see a DCIM folder for

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.130 
you're gonna see a DCIM folder for
instance<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.360> as<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.780> that's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
instance and as you know that's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.429 
instance and as you know that's
typically<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.890> most<00:01:35.310> photos<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.939> stored

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
typically where most photos are stored

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
typically where most photos are stored
so<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.619> could<00:01:37.770> collect<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.610> hit<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so we could collect that hit the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.520 
so we could collect that hit the
hamburger<00:01:40.290> menu<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.540> copy<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.350> want

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
hamburger menu here and copy it you want

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
hamburger menu here and copy it you want
to<00:01:43.590> stay<00:01:43.770> away<00:01:43.979> from<00:01:44.009> move<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.180> do

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to stay away from move because if you do

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
to stay away from move because if you do
if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.720> use<00:01:46.049> move<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:46.890> be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
if you use move you will actually be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.139 
if you use move you will actually be
moving<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.740> photos<00:01:49.740> off<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.700> device<00:01:50.820> and

moving the photos off of the device and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.160 
moving the photos off of the device and
you<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> simply

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you don't want to do that you simply

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
you don't want to do that you simply
want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> copy<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.130> over<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.549> the

copying<00:02:02.820> over<00:02:02.939> fairly<00:02:03.479> fast<00:02:03.770> there<00:02:04.770> will<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
copying over fairly fast there will be a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.059 
copying over fairly fast there will be a
little<00:02:05.430> delay<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.719> device<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.350> 8<00:02:07.530> gigabytes

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
little delay this device has 8 gigabytes

little delay this device has 8 gigabytes
of<00:02:08.220> storage<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.179> other<00:02:09.300> sizes

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
of storage there are some other sizes

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.990 
of storage there are some other sizes
available<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.560> think<00:02:10.860> eight<00:02:11.190> gigs<00:02:11.459> will<00:02:11.700> cover

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
available I think eight gigs will cover

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
available I think eight gigs will cover
most<00:02:12.330> internal<00:02:12.959> story

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
most internal story

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
most internal story
for<00:02:14.220> photos<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.880> most<00:02:15.150> devices<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.930> could

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
for photos on most devices but you could

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.140 
for photos on most devices but you could
go<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> larger<00:02:16.920> ones<00:02:18.680> all<00:02:19.680> done<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.000> now

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
go with the larger ones all done so now

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.790 
go with the larger ones all done so now
what<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.450> want<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.110> go<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
what you want to do is go to the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.550 
what you want to do is go to the
notifications<00:02:23.520> screen<00:02:23.910> where<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.780> says<00:02:24.870> USB

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
notifications screen where it says USB

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.430 
notifications screen where it says USB
mass-storage<00:02:25.830> connected<00:02:26.760> touch<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
mass-storage connected touch that and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.140 
mass-storage connected touch that and
that<00:02:28.590> basically<00:02:29.190> D<00:02:29.520> mounts<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.060> drive<00:02:32.150> so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
that basically D mounts the drive so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
that basically D mounts the drive so
then<00:02:33.390> you'll<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:33.959> USB<00:02:34.560> mass-storage<00:02:34.860> removed

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
then you'll see USB mass-storage removed

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.320 
then you'll see USB mass-storage removed
safely<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:37.080> simply<00:02:37.560> unplug<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.100> so

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290 

now<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.630> our<00:02:42.810> device<00:02:43.380> removed<00:02:44.130> from<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
now we have our device removed from the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.550 
now we have our device removed from the
mobile<00:02:46.050> device<00:02:48.110> that's<00:02:49.110> where<00:02:49.320> we<00:02:49.470> had

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
mobile device that's where we had

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.290 
mobile device that's where we had
connected<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> USB

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
connected it but we have a USB

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.910 
connected it but we have a USB
connection<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.050> other<00:02:52.200> side<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> standard

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
connection on the other side of standard

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.760 
connection on the other side of standard
USB<00:02:53.370> connection<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.989> can<00:02:55.110> go<00:02:55.200> into<00:02:55.440> our

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
USB connection so we can go into our

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.370 
USB connection so we can go into our
local<00:02:56.430> photo<00:02:56.850> lab<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.390> whatever<00:02:57.720> attached<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
local photo lab or whatever attached to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.229 
local photo lab or whatever attached to
a<00:02:58.410> kiosk<00:02:58.880> plug<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.730> works<00:03:02.970> great

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
a kiosk plug it in and this works great

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.000 
a kiosk plug it in and this works great
because<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.780> lot<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.140> these<00:03:04.230> kiosks<00:03:04.709> do<00:03:04.860> not

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
because a lot of these kiosks do not

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.979 
because a lot of these kiosks do not
like<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.520> be<00:03:05.580> directly<00:03:06.000> tethered<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.570> and/or

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
like to be directly tethered to and/or

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.370 
like to be directly tethered to and/or
Android<00:03:07.500> devices<00:03:07.850> we<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:08.880> go<00:03:09.060> ahead<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.780 

access<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.590> large<00:03:14.100> photo<00:03:15.350> DCIM<00:03:16.350> folder

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
access all that large photo DCIM folder

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.300 
access all that large photo DCIM folder
267<00:03:17.790> photos<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.450> case<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:19.739> from<00:03:20.010> Sony

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
267 photos in this case it's from Sony

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.910 
267 photos in this case it's from Sony
and<00:03:20.549> it's<00:03:21.299> fairly<00:03:21.540> inexpensive<00:03:21.810> hope<00:03:22.799> you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
and it's fairly inexpensive hope you

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.850 
and it's fairly inexpensive hope you
enjoyed<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.370> program
