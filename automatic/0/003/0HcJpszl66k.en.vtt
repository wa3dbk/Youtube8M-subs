a<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.860> bit<00:03:11.980> more<00:03:12.130> precise<00:03:12.820> but<00:03:13.690> only

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
a little bit more precise but only

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.660 
a little bit more precise but only
because<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.530> would<00:03:14.680> work<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.220> little<00:03:15.580> bit

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
