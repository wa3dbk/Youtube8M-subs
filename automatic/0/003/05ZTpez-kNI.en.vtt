00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.380 
got to be very careful to get something
underneath<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
underneath and I don't know how well I

can show this underneath the edge as
opposed<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.040> wrinkling<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
opposed to you know wrinkling it

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.420 
opposed to you know wrinkling it
squishing<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> you'll<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> little

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.980 

wrinkle<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> edge<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> be

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
wrinkle on the edge so you have to be

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.359 
wrinkle on the edge so you have to be
very<00:01:37.020> careful<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.590> digging<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> edge<00:01:38.159> up

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
very careful about digging the edge up

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
very careful about digging the edge up
once<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.090> side<00:01:39.299> done<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.780> fine

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
once you have one side done you're fine

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.649 
once you have one side done you're fine
and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.950> instead<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> peeling<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.390> sticker

end<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.399> less<00:01:53.759> curling<00:01:54.390> which<00:01:55.640> distorts

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
end up with less curling which distorts

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.069 
end up with less curling which distorts
the<00:01:56.759> sticker<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.299> make<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.869> difficult

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the sticker and make it more difficult

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.969 
the sticker and make it more difficult
to<00:01:58.610> reapply<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.229> saw<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.530> take<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.710> off

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
to reapply so you saw me take that off

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
to reapply so you saw me take that off
it's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.850> wrinkled<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.329> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
it's a little bit wrinkled because I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's a little bit wrinkled because I
wasn't<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> process

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
wasn't you know it was a process

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.059 
wasn't you know it was a process
learning<00:02:06.899> how<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.560> correctly<00:02:07.740> i'm

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
learning how to do this correctly i'm

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.430 
learning how to do this correctly i'm
going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> put<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> back<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.440> then

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to put it back on now and then

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.869 
going to put it back on now and then
i'll<00:02:10.619> show<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.069> i<00:02:11.160> did<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.489> damage<00:02:11.849> it

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.589 

so<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.299> thing<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.629> found<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.049> that<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.420> holes

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
so the thing I found is that the holes

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.119 
so the thing I found is that the holes
will<00:02:21.810> line<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.019> even<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.500> you're<00:02:22.620> off<00:02:22.739> center

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
will line up even if you're off center

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.800 
will line up even if you're off center
so<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> try<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.940> camera<00:02:24.420> perfectly

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so I try to get the camera perfectly

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.520 
so I try to get the camera perfectly
centered<00:02:26.480> around<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.810> edge<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> sticker

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
centered around the edge of the sticker

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.550 
centered around the edge of the sticker
and<00:02:29.120> then<00:02:30.120> use<00:02:30.480> somethin<00:02:30.900> else<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> side

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and then use somethin else on the side

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:41.440 
and then use somethin else on the side
to<00:02:31.590> make<00:02:32.010> sure<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:33.739> twisted<00:02:34.739> wrong

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.150 

so<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.810> tell<00:02:42.989> there<00:02:43.200> where<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> tried<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
so you can tell there where I tried to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.280 
so you can tell there where I tried to
peel<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.400> wrong<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.940> ended<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.140> little

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
peel it wrong and ended up with a little

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.750 
peel it wrong and ended up with a little
wrinkle<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.890> edge<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.160> even<00:02:47.430> when<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.609> do

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
wrinkle on the edge but even when you do

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.330 
wrinkle on the edge but even when you do
that<00:02:47.940> if<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.150> push<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.569> down<00:02:48.859> you<00:02:49.859> can<00:02:50.040> kind<00:02:50.280> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that if you push it down you can kind of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.949 
that if you push it down you can kind of
rub<00:02:50.579> out<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.760> wrinkle<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:51.660> not

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
rub out the wrinkle and it's not

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.490 
rub out the wrinkle and it's not
noticeable<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.299> i<00:02:54.450> said<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.959> main

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
noticeable but like i said the main

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.809 
noticeable but like i said the main
thing<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.010> want<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> take<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.430> off<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
thing if you want to take it off and

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.420 
thing if you want to take it off and
then<00:02:56.849> reapply<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.840> careful<00:02:58.200> with

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
then reapply is to be careful with

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.740 
then reapply is to be careful with
picking<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.700> edge<00:02:59.879> with<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.359> fingernail

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
picking up the edge with your fingernail

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.000 
picking up the edge with your fingernail
or<00:03:00.930> something<00:03:01.260> even<00:03:01.500> sharp<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.829> would<00:03:01.920> be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
or something even sharp it would be

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.449 
or something even sharp it would be
better<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.530> then<00:03:04.530> also<00:03:04.680> peel<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.190> phone<00:03:05.340> away

better and then also peel the phone away
from<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.760> sticker<00:03:06.000> instead<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.569> sticker

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.280 
away from the phone so you can see that
looks<00:03:09.359> really<00:03:09.690> nice<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:11.780> some<00:03:12.780> creases
