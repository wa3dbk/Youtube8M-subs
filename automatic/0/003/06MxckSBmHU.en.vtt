00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.930

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.170

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.470

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.869
 with this horse is worth and good and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 I know how how how used is the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.880
 horse armor and how to get on 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 a horse is worth it if I do not get a donkey 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.340
 so the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.170
 to do is to go up and do not reject us and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.340
 well yes we are a long time and we do not 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 denies 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.530
 they have rejected us because we can approve it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.180
 ok until you refuse us to see us 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.450
 will leave with transits when we do not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.110
 reject and it may take a long time 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 not late 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 and let him dedicate himself 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.339

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.770
