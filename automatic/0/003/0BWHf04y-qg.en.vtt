00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
are from the far future don't be looking

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.790 
are from the far future don't be looking
for<00:00:22.070> 0<00:00:22.310> Monday<00:00:22.850> because<00:00:23.539> you<00:00:24.110> won't<00:00:24.260> find<00:00:24.620> them

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
for 0 Monday because you won't find them

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.440 
for 0 Monday because you won't find them
and<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.400> reason<00:00:25.640> why<00:00:25.760> we<00:00:25.970> need<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.210> know<00:00:26.330> how

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
and the reason why we need to know how

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.540 
and the reason why we need to know how
to<00:00:26.480> get<00:00:26.690> glimmer<00:00:27.050> is<00:00:27.350> because<00:00:27.950> a<00:00:27.980> lot<00:00:28.369> of

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
to get glimmer is because a lot of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.810 
to get glimmer is because a lot of
rewards<00:00:29.210> upgrades<00:00:29.960> pretty<00:00:30.710> much<00:00:30.890> everything

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
rewards upgrades pretty much everything

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.479 
rewards upgrades pretty much everything
on<00:00:31.970> destiny<00:00:32.539> involves<00:00:33.110> glimmer<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:34.309> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
on destiny involves glimmer it's the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.549 
on destiny involves glimmer it's the
currency<00:00:34.850> on<00:00:35.180> destiny<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.109> what<00:00:36.350> we're<00:00:36.469> going

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
currency on destiny so what we're going

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.470 
currency on destiny so what we're going
to<00:00:36.620> need<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.920> do<00:00:37.069> is<00:00:37.399> figure<00:00:37.789> out<00:00:37.940> faster

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
to need to do is figure out faster

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.020 
to need to do is figure out faster
methods<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.170> get<00:00:39.440> glimmer<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.069> this<00:00:40.609> method<00:00:40.969> I

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
methods to get glimmer and this method I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.729 
methods to get glimmer and this method I
have<00:00:41.149> for<00:00:41.359> you<00:00:41.420> guys<00:00:41.629> actually<00:00:42.109> it's<00:00:42.530> not<00:00:42.679> that

do not have to do to difficulty that I
am<00:00:49.999> doing<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.420> on<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.109> you<00:00:51.260> can<00:00:51.409> see<00:00:51.620> how<00:00:51.769> much

am doing it on but you can see how much

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.829 
am doing it on but you can see how much
glimmer<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.309> gets<00:00:52.699> by<00:00:53.059> doing<00:00:53.389> it<00:00:53.510> on<00:00:53.659> the

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
glimmer I gets by doing it on the

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.869 
glimmer I gets by doing it on the
hardest<00:00:54.199> difficulty<00:00:54.589> but<00:00:55.399> anyways<00:00:55.699> you'll

beginning of this Mars mission you'll
just<00:00:59.449> have<00:00:59.569> to<00:00:59.690> run<00:00:59.899> for<00:01:00.109> a<00:01:00.170> little<00:01:00.440> bit<00:01:00.649> but

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
just have to run for a little bit but

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:02.439 
just have to run for a little bit but
you'll<00:01:01.190> finally<00:01:01.459> get<00:01:01.789> here<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.089> when<00:01:02.209> you<00:01:02.299> get

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
you'll finally get here and when you get

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.879 
you'll finally get here and when you get
here<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.959> alarm<00:01:03.229> will<00:01:03.409> sound<00:01:03.559> when<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:03.889 
here the alarm will sound when the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:05.530 
here the alarm will sound when the
ghosts<00:01:04.159> are<00:01:04.250> trying<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.549> overload<00:01:04.850> something

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
ghosts are trying to overload something

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.020 
ghosts are trying to overload something
and<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:06.320> door<00:01:06.560> will<00:01:06.799> start<00:01:07.010> opening<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:08.000> can

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
and this door will start opening you can

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.730 
and this door will start opening you can
stay<00:01:08.360> here<00:01:08.570> as<00:01:08.719> long<00:01:08.750> as<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.229> want

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
stay here as long as you want

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.590 
stay here as long as you want
and<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.460> way<00:01:10.579> this<00:01:10.729> works<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.240> want<00:01:11.509> to

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
and the way this works is you want to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.480 
and the way this works is you want to
use<00:01:11.719> your<00:01:11.840> resupply<00:01:12.289> coach<00:01:12.770> because<00:01:13.130> when<00:01:13.369> you

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
use your resupply coach because when you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.219 
use your resupply coach because when you
use<00:01:13.700> these<00:01:13.880> consumables<00:01:14.539> it<00:01:14.780> helps<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.110> get

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
use these consumables it helps you get

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.440 
use these consumables it helps you get
more<00:01:15.409> glimmer<00:01:15.770> from<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.159> cabal's<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.969> not<00:01:17.299> to

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
more glimmer from the cabal's and not to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.179 
more glimmer from the cabal's and not to
mention<00:01:17.600> plenty<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.079> resupply<00:01:18.439> coats<00:01:18.920> and

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
mention plenty of resupply coats and

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.830 
mention plenty of resupply coats and
network<00:01:19.609> keys<00:01:19.909> will<00:01:20.149> drop<00:01:20.450> from<00:01:20.630> these

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
network keys will drop from these

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.270 
network keys will drop from these
enemies<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.350> if<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:21.500> don't<00:01:21.680> have<00:01:21.799> resupply

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
enemies so if you don't have resupply

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.010 
enemies so if you don't have resupply
code<00:01:22.490> yet<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:23.270> can<00:01:23.390> go<00:01:23.539> here<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:23.780> start

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
code yet you can go here and start

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.810 
code yet you can go here and start
farming<00:01:24.259> here<00:01:24.560> for<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.770> little<00:01:25.009> bit<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.340> sooner

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
farming here for a little bit and sooner

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.010 
farming here for a little bit and sooner
or<00:01:25.850> later<00:01:25.939> you'll<00:01:26.270> get<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.509> hold<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.840> some

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
or later you'll get a hold of some

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.719 
or later you'll get a hold of some
resupply<00:01:27.469> coats<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.920> start<00:01:28.189> this<00:01:28.340> glimmer

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
resupply coats to start this glimmer

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.389 
resupply coats to start this glimmer
farm<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.689> could<00:01:29.869> still<00:01:30.109> get<00:01:30.619> glimmer<00:01:31.070> here

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
farm you could still get glimmer here

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.459 
farm you could still get glimmer here
without<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.850> resupply<00:01:32.179> codes<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.020> just<00:01:33.259> helps

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
without the resupply codes it just helps

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.260 
without the resupply codes it just helps
