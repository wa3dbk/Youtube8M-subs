bit and we'll see how it looks tomorrow
morning<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.410> think<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.920> better<00:00:32.130> way<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
morning I think this is a better way for

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.160 
morning I think this is a better way for
me<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> kind<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.180> control<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.829> hair<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
me to kind of get control of the hair I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.830 
me to kind of get control of the hair I
imagine<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.489> straighter<00:00:39.000> or<00:00:39.149> earlier

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
imagine that on a straighter or earlier

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
imagine that on a straighter or earlier
texture<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.620> could<00:00:40.800> probably<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
texture you could probably just put the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.500 
texture you could probably just put the
product<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.500> hair<00:00:43.890> itself<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.390> know

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
product on your hair itself and you know

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
product on your hair itself and you know
we<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.899> through<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.469> should<00:00:46.649> probably

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
we get through and it should probably

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
we get through and it should probably
give<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> look<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.450> my

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
give you the look you want from my

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
give you the look you want from my
particular<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> think<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> need

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
particular I think it's going to need

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
particular I think it's going to need
some<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.640> bit<00:00:50.730> more<00:00:50.879> manipulation<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
some a little bit more manipulation I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
some a little bit more manipulation I
mean<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> let<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> air<00:00:53.129> dry<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
mean I'm going to let this air dry and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.410 
mean I'm going to let this air dry and
tomorrow<00:00:54.300> I'll<00:00:54.510> let<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.719> out<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:55.500> exhausted
