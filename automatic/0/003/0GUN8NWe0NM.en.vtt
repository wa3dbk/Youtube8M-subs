00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.469
 preferably three neighborhoods in each booth 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.450

 celtic ' for my eclipse 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.280
 so at least the eclipse has to have 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.789
 three bikes actually available three 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 crowded neighborhoods in the case in the macs here 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.500
 do not have all the bikes without any 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.109
 problem the second garage has no 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.420
 I'm going to get a bike from here. 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.760
 is in the team to rise with the eclipse and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.010
 obviously the eclipse will have to be with 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 rack full of neighborhoods or in the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.330
 Eclipse I have three neighborhoods here only 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.920
 I had two here I can have up to one more 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.280
 in the garage to which you are going to 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.890
 glitch you will have to have all the bikes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.189
 buy three neighborhoods of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.909
 in the galley $ 800 costs each 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.950
 bike 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 then it will not make any difference well 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 very fucking crazy team attention 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 The people have been doing it since the old days. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 now came back this ticket in a way 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.310

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.020
 More or less where you cried, you're taking away. 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.380

 control will be tremendous, will you? 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.170

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.459
 You go on the scene that I obviously gave 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.780
