wall like so and fam you'd see yourself
but<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:44.789> mirrors<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:45.899> yourself

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
but two mirrors and you can see yourself

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.510 
but two mirrors and you can see yourself
for<00:00:48.020> 68<00:00:49.020> whatever<00:00:50.719> it's<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.190> slow<00:00:53.190> right

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
for 68 whatever it's kind of slow right

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.979 
for 68 whatever it's kind of slow right
now<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.420> could<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:55.020> improved<00:00:55.969> but<00:00:56.969> uh<00:00:57.030> yes<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
now it could be improved but uh yes so

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.639 
now it could be improved but uh yes so
it<00:00:58.649> says<00:00:59.129> idea<00:00:59.609> add<00:00:59.820> was<00:01:00.120> gonna<00:01:00.629> work<00:01:00.840> quite<00:01:01.620> as

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it says idea add was gonna work quite as

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.560 
it says idea add was gonna work quite as
well<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.100> um<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:03.979> it<00:01:04.979> should<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.210> I've<00:01:06.360> made<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
well as um as it should but I've made a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.859 
well as um as it should but I've made a
maze<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.799> full<00:01:08.520> mirror<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
maze over here full mirror is just a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.980 
maze over here full mirror is just a
small<00:01:10.380> maze<00:01:11.119> right<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> would<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
small maze right I think this would be a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.609 
small maze right I think this would be a
really<00:01:13.080> cool<00:01:13.590> idea<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.760> save<00:01:15.240> us<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:16.320> there's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
really cool idea if save us if there's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.950 
really cool idea if save us if there's
Maude<00:01:17.030> yeah<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:20.430> isn't<00:01:20.790> even

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
Maude yeah see the this isn't even

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
Maude yeah see the this isn't even
loading<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.650> there's<00:01:23.100> 20<00:01:23.549> mirrors<00:01:24.000> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
loading in I think there's 20 mirrors in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.109 
loading in I think there's 20 mirrors in
one<00:01:24.509> spot<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.290> won't<00:01:26.420> show<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> reflection<00:01:29.119> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
one spot it won't show the reflection so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
one spot it won't show the reflection so
yeah<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.380> doesn't<00:01:31.860> work<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.189> as

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
yeah that this this doesn't work out as

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
yeah that this this doesn't work out as
well<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.759> how<00:01:33.060> cool<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> be

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
well but how cool would it be to be

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
well but how cool would it be to be
walking<00:01:34.500> through<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> those<00:01:36.060> real

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
walking through like one of those real

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.319 
walking through like one of those real
life<00:01:36.750> mirror<00:01:37.680> mazes<00:01:38.369> where<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.000> see

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
life mirror mazes where you just see

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.310 
life mirror mazes where you just see
yourself<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.500> place<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> really

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
yourself all over the place it's really

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
yourself all over the place it's really
difficult<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.979> find<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.490> through<00:01:44.759> these

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
difficult to find your way through these

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.260 
difficult to find your way through these
things<00:01:45.329> um<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> freaking<00:01:47.610> mirrors<00:01:48.119> would

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
things um if the freaking mirrors would

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.590 
things um if the freaking mirrors would
load<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.950> mod<00:01:50.610> isn't<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.210> isn't<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
load in but as mod isn't that isn't that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.740 
load in but as mod isn't that isn't that
great<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.799> um<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.270> mod<00:01:54.540> could

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
great right now but um if this mod could

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
great right now but um if this mod could
be<00:01:54.840> improved<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.680> somebody<00:01:56.070> make<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> really

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
be improved and somebody make a really

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.830 
be improved and somebody make a really
big<00:01:57.259> really<00:01:58.259> huge<00:01:59.219> mirror<00:01:59.850> maze<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.479> gonna<00:02:00.719> be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
big really huge mirror maze I'm gonna be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.410 
big really huge mirror maze I'm gonna be
so<00:02:01.170> confusing<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.909> through<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> if

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
so confusing to go through that so if

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.389 
so confusing to go through that so if
anybody<00:02:06.810> could<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.740> would<00:02:07.770> be

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
anybody could do that that would be

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.530 
anybody could do that that would be
amazing<00:02:10.430> short<00:02:11.430> video<00:02:11.760> today<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> guess

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
amazing short video today I guess

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.670 
amazing short video today I guess
because<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:15.079> just<00:02:16.079> mirrors

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
because this is really get just mirrors

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.899 
because this is really get just mirrors
and<00:02:17.030> amazed<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:19.079> constructed<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.950> think

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
and amazed I just constructed I think

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.940 
and amazed I just constructed I think
this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.269> exit<00:02:21.720> yes<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.879> but<00:02:23.879> uh<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.319> if

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
this is the exit yes it is but uh so if

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.289 
this is the exit yes it is but uh so if
you<00:02:26.819> wanna<00:02:27.140> saws<00:02:28.140> modeling<00:02:29.040> isn't

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
you wanna saws modeling isn't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it's kind of dumb but um I like the maze

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.960 
it's kind of dumb but um I like the maze
idea<00:02:38.310> i<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:39.440> hope<00:02:40.440> somebody<00:02:40.889> can<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.700> that

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
idea i really hope somebody can do that
