in this video I am demonstrating my la
the<00:00:12.760> terminal<00:00:13.760> tester<00:00:14.290> just<00:00:15.290> just<00:00:16.010> substitute

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
the terminal tester just just substitute

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.720 
the terminal tester just just substitute
if<00:00:17.150> you<00:00:17.360> can<00:00:17.510> imagine<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.350> exhaust<00:00:18.740> fan<00:00:19.160> for

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
if you can imagine the exhaust fan for

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.230 
if you can imagine the exhaust fan for
the<00:00:19.820> red<00:00:20.029> LED<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:22.040> glow<00:00:22.310> plug<00:00:22.610> for<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:22.970> green

the red LED the glow plug for the green

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.390 
the red LED the glow plug for the green

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
yellow LED now watching the sequence of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.740 
yellow LED now watching the sequence of
events<00:00:38.980> taking<00:00:39.980> place<00:00:40.239> your<00:00:41.239> sequence<00:00:41.630> in

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
events taking place your sequence in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.939 
events taking place your sequence in
which<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:44.600> different<00:00:44.960> components<00:00:45.079> come<00:00:45.620> on

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.759 

now<00:00:51.949> here<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:52.370> see<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.550> controller

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
now here we see the controller

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.439 
now here we see the controller
controller<00:00:54.769> light<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.570> green<00:00:57.280> not<00:00:58.280> red<00:00:58.449> it

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
controller light is green not red it

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.590 
controller light is green not red it
will<00:00:59.570> turn<00:00:59.719> red<00:00:59.989> if<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.179> thermocouple<00:01:02.179> gets

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
will turn red if the thermocouple gets

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.450 
will turn red if the thermocouple gets
hot<00:01:02.839> well<00:01:03.289> of<00:01:03.379> course<00:01:03.409> thermocouple<00:01:04.309> won't

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
hot well of course thermocouple won't

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.410 
hot well of course thermocouple won't
get<00:01:05.150> hot<00:01:05.360> sitting<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:05.870> bench<00:01:06.940> so<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:08.270> will<00:01:08.360> go

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
get hot sitting on bench so it will go

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.910 
get hot sitting on bench so it will go
into<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.720> shutdown<00:01:08.990> mode<00:01:09.409> one<00:01:09.860> speed<00:01:10.480> its<00:01:11.480> full

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
into a shutdown mode one speed its full

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.490 
into a shutdown mode one speed its full
power

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.300 

everything<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.619> speeding<00:01:23.039> up<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:26.039> yellow

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
everything is speeding up the yellow

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
everything is speeding up the yellow
fuel<00:01:26.640> pump<00:01:26.909> light<00:01:27.329> is<00:01:27.539> going<00:01:27.689> faster<00:01:28.200> faster

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
fuel pump light is going faster faster

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.279 
fuel pump light is going faster faster
faster<00:01:32.299> pretty<00:01:33.299> soon<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.719> glow<00:01:33.899> plug<00:01:34.140> will

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
faster pretty soon the glow plug will

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.319 
faster pretty soon the glow plug will
turn<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.740> green<00:01:35.369> glow<00:01:35.700> plug<00:01:35.970> will<00:01:36.149> turn

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
turn off the green glow plug will turn

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:45.080 
turn off the green glow plug will turn
off<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.069> it<00:01:44.159> turned<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.789> running

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
off you know it turned off it's running

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.590 
off you know it turned off it's running
at<00:01:45.179> full<00:01:45.390> speed<00:01:46.909> of<00:01:47.909> course<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> controller

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
at full speed of course the controller

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
at full speed of course the controller
doesn't<00:01:48.869> sense<00:01:49.619> any<00:01:49.829> heat<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.579> shut

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
doesn't sense any heat so it will shut

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.449 
doesn't sense any heat so it will shut
down<00:01:50.819> now<00:01:51.420> shut<00:01:51.750> down<00:01:54.950> now<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.039> we<00:01:56.130> look<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
down now shut down now if we look at the

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:57.949 
down now shut down now if we look at the
controller<00:01:56.849> the<00:01:57.119> green<00:01:57.329> light<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.810> out

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
controller the green light will be out

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.710 
controller the green light will be out
and<00:01:59.179> the<00:02:00.179> red<00:02:00.360> light<00:02:00.509> loss<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:00.929> be<00:02:01.079> out<00:02:02.720> it's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and the red light loss will be out it's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.550 
and the red light loss will be out it's
in<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.989> cooldown<00:02:04.470> mode<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:06.409> only<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
in a cooldown mode right now only the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.559 
in a cooldown mode right now only the
fan<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> water<00:02:09.360> pump<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.810> running

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
fan and the water pump are running

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.300 
fan and the water pump are running
pretty<00:02:12.569> soon<00:02:12.870> only<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> fan<00:02:13.739> will<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.069> running

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
pretty soon only the fan will be running

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.400 
pretty soon only the fan will be running
and<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:15.360> glow<00:02:15.510> plug<00:02:15.780> will<00:02:15.900> try<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.140> light

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and the glow plug will try to light

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:28.649 
and the glow plug will try to light
again<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.650> will<00:02:19.739> do<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> three<00:02:20.430> times

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.819 

and<00:02:29.659> then<00:02:29.959> you'll<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.349> restart<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
and then you'll have to restart the

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:37.270 
and then you'll have to restart the
computer<00:02:31.189> I<00:02:35.620> won't<00:02:36.620> show<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.859> all<00:02:37.099> three

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
computer I won't show you all three

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.759 
computer I won't show you all three
times<00:02:37.609> where<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:37.879> will<00:02:38.239> show<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.650> when<00:02:39.650> they

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
times where I will show you when they

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.929 
times where I will show you when they
try<00:02:40.010> start<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.549> again<00:02:42.489> let's<00:02:43.489> see<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> green

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
try start up again let's see the green

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.920 
try start up again let's see the green
LED<00:02:44.239> come<00:02:44.780> on<00:02:45.189> after<00:02:46.189> the<00:02:46.579> fan<00:02:46.819> I'm<00:02:47.480> side<00:02:47.720> by

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
LED come on after the fan I'm side by

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.420 
LED come on after the fan I'm side by
itself

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.720 

and<00:02:57.180> now<00:02:57.299> fans<00:02:57.510> coming<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:57.989> by<00:02:58.200> itself<00:03:01.730> three
