chance<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.560> read<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> scenario<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.700> okay

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
chance to read the scenario I did okay

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
chance to read the scenario I did okay
there's<00:01:22.020> another<00:01:22.320> copy<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> scenario

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
there's another copy of the scenario

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.399 
there's another copy of the scenario
right<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.180> refer<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.170> we're

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
right there we refer to it as we're

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.350 
right there we refer to it as we're
talking<00:01:25.530> okay<00:01:26.009> okay<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.930> need<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.340> um

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
talking okay okay so we need to think um

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.770 
talking okay okay so we need to think um
interesting<00:01:30.360> interesting<00:01:31.020> scenario<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.590> think

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
interesting interesting scenario I think

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.210 
interesting interesting scenario I think
so<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.110> definitely<00:01:35.009> read<00:01:35.340> some<00:01:35.460> things<00:01:35.670> about

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
so I definitely read some things about

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.030 
so I definitely read some things about
healthful<00:01:37.090> medicine<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:38.650> can<00:01:38.800> see<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
healthful medicine and so I can see the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.140 
healthful medicine and so I can see the
side<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.310> what<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.610> thought<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.880> better<00:01:40.000> life

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
side of what I thought you better life

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.900 
side of what I thought you better life
use<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:41.860> also<00:01:41.980> see<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.400> ethical

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
use it but you can also see the ethical

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.730 
use it but you can also see the ethical
I'm<00:01:43.000> gonna<00:01:43.180> go<00:01:43.480> through<00:01:43.780> or<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.230> think<00:01:44.530> you

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
I'm gonna go through or you think you

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.670 
I'm gonna go through or you think you
would<00:01:44.860> go<00:01:44.950> through<00:01:45.160> trying<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.000> use<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.290> why<00:01:50.290> is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
would go through trying to use so why is

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.290 
would go through trying to use so why is
what<00:01:51.100> he's<00:01:51.280> doing<00:01:51.610> wrong<00:01:51.850> or<00:01:52.330> right<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:54.120> mean<00:01:55.120> I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
what he's doing wrong or right I mean I

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.420 
what he's doing wrong or right I mean I
think<00:01:55.330> it's<00:01:55.540> kind<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.810> kind<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.410> hard<00:01:56.620> with

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
think it's kind of a kind of hard with

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.890 
think it's kind of a kind of hard with
my<00:01:57.640> knowledge<00:01:58.000> but<00:01:58.030> it's<00:01:58.270> balanced<00:01:58.570> table<00:01:58.840> is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
my knowledge but it's balanced table is

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.490 
my knowledge but it's balanced table is
right<00:01:59.140> or<00:01:59.290> wrong<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.740> think<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.480> see<00:02:01.660> 21<00:02:02.080> why

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
right or wrong I think I can see 21 why

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.650 
right or wrong I think I can see 21 why
you<00:02:03.250> want<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.520> use<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:04.000> seems<00:02:04.360> like<00:02:04.450> from

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
you want to use it it seems like from

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.500 
you want to use it it seems like from
the<00:02:04.780> scenario<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.770> know<00:02:06.370> they<00:02:07.120> really<00:02:07.270> have

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
the scenario you know they really have

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.290 
the scenario you know they really have
much<00:02:07.720> background<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:08.590> why<00:02:08.709> he<00:02:08.860> did<00:02:09.040> it<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:09.910> I

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
much background for why he did it so I

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.180 
much background for why he did it so I
would<00:02:10.510> have<00:02:10.540> to<00:02:10.750> go<00:02:10.869> si<00:02:11.140> you've<00:02:11.290> wronged<00:02:11.560> by

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
would have to go si you've wronged by

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.680 
would have to go si you've wronged by
doing<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.640> because<00:02:12.880> he's<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.330> hustling

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
doing it because he's kind of hustling

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.380 
doing it because he's kind of hustling
the<00:02:13.840> patient's<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.500> really<00:02:14.770> helping<00:02:15.400> them<00:02:15.580> no

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
the patient's not really helping them no

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.530 
the patient's not really helping them no
reason<00:02:16.570> why<00:02:16.870> we<00:02:17.050> should<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.590> there<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.580> i<00:02:18.910> doubt

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
reason why we should be there so i doubt

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.360 
reason why we should be there so i doubt
at<00:02:19.750> City<00:02:20.020> Ramadan<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:20.980> surely<00:02:23.370> somebody

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
at City Ramadan that surely somebody

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.020 
at City Ramadan that surely somebody
else<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:25.120> doing<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:27.040> what<00:02:27.310> action<00:02:27.880> would

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
else are we doing so what action would

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.920 
else are we doing so what action would
you<00:02:28.209> take<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.020> case<00:02:29.580> i<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.810> i<00:02:31.870> would

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
you take in this case i think i would

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.180 
you take in this case i think i would
probably<00:02:32.800> talk<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.010> some<00:02:33.490> other<00:02:33.670> doctors

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.980 

this<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> common<00:02:39.210> trend<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.690> know<00:02:39.780> maybe

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
this is a common trend you know maybe

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.770 
this is a common trend you know maybe
it's<00:02:40.170> something<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.980> should<00:02:41.160> learn<00:02:41.370> more<00:02:41.670> about

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
it's something I should learn more about

00:02:41.780 --> 00:03:17.160 
it's something I should learn more about
you<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.170> not

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:29.410 

nothing<00:03:18.170> worked<00:03:18.440> there<00:03:19.300> as<00:03:20.300> far<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.700> what

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
nothing worked there as far as so what

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:38.850 
nothing worked there as far as so what
