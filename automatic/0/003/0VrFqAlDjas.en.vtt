00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.270
 the first time a show of 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.030
 comparsa the interdiscipline present in 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.190
 the meter really involves an effort 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.290
 titanic because 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.350
 how can this transshipment be realized 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.450
 it's huge there's no way to lower the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.190
 load and the amount of props 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.930
 instruments and types that is required 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.180
 for the realization of the show is 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.790
 huge then especially for our 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.790
 technical team has been a great effort 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 we 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.210
 the parents be here in meters that by 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.700
 example suddenly happens people who from 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.190
 another way I could not see this no 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.240
 would come here because that is us we do not 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.490
 I will reach arms 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.200
 do not call them attention or even 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.970
 it's something that the clown has been projected to you 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 or they do not have money 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.180
 are happening and he prepares to see the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.180
 people who do stay 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.670
 this is second call second call 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.080
 so that the show of 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.990
 comparsa the region with a clown 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.990
 theater of comparsa the bulla thanks 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.790
 let's say that this is one of the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.640
 shows that at this moment we have 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.980
 as more entrenched then we 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 we are confident of the result 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.880
 This is the third call for 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.880
 start requiem for a clown 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.880
