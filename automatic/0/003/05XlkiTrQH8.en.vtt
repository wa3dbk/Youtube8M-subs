00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
question that we're trying to ask is how

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
question that we're trying to ask is how
genes<00:01:05.580> regulate<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.570> inedible<00:01:06.810> parts<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.440> the

rice plant the leaves and the stems we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
rice plant the leaves and the stems we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
call this the biomass we need a faster

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
call this the biomass we need a faster
way<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.509> measure<00:01:12.869> how<00:01:13.560> these<00:01:13.860> traits<00:01:14.190> are

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
way to measure how these traits are

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.889 
way to measure how these traits are
expressed<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.910> field<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
with CSU is helping us to develop this

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.270 
with CSU is helping us to develop this
this<00:01:30.119> machine<00:01:30.539> it's<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.289> pilot<00:01:32.039> project

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this machine it's really a pilot project

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
this machine it's really a pilot project
at<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.850> point<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.330> we're<00:01:33.509> trying<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
at this point and we're trying to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.540 
at this point and we're trying to
develop<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.320> sensors<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.369> they're

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
develop the sensors and so they're

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.490 
develop the sensors and so they're
looking<00:01:35.940> at<00:01:36.060> mainly<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.080> biomass

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
looking at mainly the biomass

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560 
looking at mainly the biomass
differences<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.520> their<00:01:38.729> population<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
differences in their population of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
differences in their population of
rights<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.050> they're<00:01:40.229> growing<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> they

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
rights that they're growing and they

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
rights that they're growing and they
have<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:42.479> understanding<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
have a very good understanding of a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
have a very good understanding of a
genetic<00:01:43.619> makeup<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.580> rights<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
genetic makeup of all the rights and so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
genetic makeup of all the rights and so
they're<00:01:45.570> trying<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> associate<00:01:46.409> those<00:01:46.710> jeans

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
they're trying to associate those jeans

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.860 
they're trying to associate those jeans
with<00:01:48.049> biomass

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.350 

for<00:01:52.470> me<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> fun<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
for me this is a lot of fun this is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.530 
for me this is a lot of fun this is
really<00:01:54.600> cool<00:01:55.190> basically<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:56.700> an<00:01:57.000> automated

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
really cool basically it's an automated

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.680 
really cool basically it's an automated
remote<00:01:58.380> sensing<00:01:58.860> platform<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.510> has<00:02:00.660> a

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
remote sensing platform and so it has a

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.920 
remote sensing platform and so it has a
lot<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> sensors<00:02:01.530> equipped<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.690> spray<00:02:03.690> boom

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
lot of sensors equipped on a spray boom

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.140 
lot of sensors equipped on a spray boom
of<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.200> tractor<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.830> these<00:02:05.160> sensors<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:05.910> can

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
of a tractor and these sensors then can

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.910 
of a tractor and these sensors then can
automatically<00:02:06.780> take<00:02:07.230> many<00:02:07.470> different<00:02:07.620> types

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
automatically take many different types

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.980 
automatically take many different types
of<00:02:08.100> measurements<00:02:08.430> they're<00:02:08.850> measuring<00:02:09.330> things

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
of measurements they're measuring things

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.780 
of measurements they're measuring things
like<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.440> height<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> canopy<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
like the height of the canopy the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.150 
like the height of the canopy the
temperature<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.200> canopy<00:02:13.620> these<00:02:13.920> are<00:02:14.070> of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
temperature of the canopy these are of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.920 
temperature of the canopy these are of
interest<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.820> physiologist<00:02:15.480> here<00:02:15.720> and

not<00:03:41.420> only<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.650> increased<00:03:43.690> green

not only to have increased green

increased bioenergy traits but also

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.880 
increased bioenergy traits but also
