vandals<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:08.400> tools<00:00:08.670> are<00:00:09.179> completed

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
vandals and my tools are completed

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.589 
vandals and my tools are completed
you've<00:00:11.550> probably<00:00:11.759> seen<00:00:12.120> some<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.450> these

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
you've probably seen some of these

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.670 
you've probably seen some of these
fancier<00:00:13.200> ones<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.009> an<00:00:14.549> example<00:00:14.940> here

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
fancier ones which is an example here

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.050 
fancier ones which is an example here
this<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> Thompson<00:00:17.640> tool<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.539> built

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
this is on a Thompson tool that I built

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.590 
this is on a Thompson tool that I built
you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.279> lamination<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.600> very

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
you can see that the lamination is very

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.950 
you can see that the lamination is very
even<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> equal<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.539> you<00:00:27.539> might<00:00:27.750> be

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
even and equal and you might be

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
even and equal and you might be
interested<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.429> tool<00:00:29.670> like

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
interested to know that the tool like

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.620 
interested to know that the tool like
that<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:30.449> start<00:00:30.750> looking<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.630> this

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that will start looking like this this

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.360 
that will start looking like this this
is<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> laminated<00:00:34.680> blanks<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.190> I've

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
is one of the laminated blanks that I've

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030 
is one of the laminated blanks that I've
made<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.840> ready<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.380> trimming<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
made and it's ready for trimming on the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
made and it's ready for trimming on the
ends<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.120> centering<00:00:39.510> technique<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
ends and the centering technique that I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.459 
ends and the centering technique that I
use<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.800> will<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.219> another<00:00:41.489> video<00:00:42.410> but<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
use which will be in another video but I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
use which will be in another video but I
want<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.190> how<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.969> lamination<00:00:45.870> like

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
want you to see how a lamination like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220 
want you to see how a lamination like
this<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:47.160> started<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.719> couple<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this get started and a couple of the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.930 
this get started and a couple of the
steps<00:00:49.530> involved<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.280> making<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.730> happen

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
steps involved in making it happen

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.979 
steps involved in making it happen
evenly<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> turn<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> handle

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
evenly so that when you turn the handle

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
evenly so that when you turn the handle
it<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.140> come<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.350> looking<00:00:56.190> similar<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.820> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it will come out looking similar to this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.569 
it will come out looking similar to this
one<00:00:59.629> now<00:01:00.629> handle<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:02.190> often

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
one now handle like this will often

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.100 
one now handle like this will often
start<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> core<00:01:05.090> usually<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.479> wood

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
start with a core usually out of wood

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
start with a core usually out of wood
that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.799> very<00:01:08.280> solid<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> straight<00:01:09.210> doesn't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that is very solid and straight doesn't

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
that is very solid and straight doesn't
necessarily<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.740> exotic<00:01:11.040> because

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
necessarily have to be an exotic because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
necessarily have to be an exotic because
you<00:01:12.150> probably<00:01:12.720> aren't<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you probably aren't going to see it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.859 
you probably aren't going to see it
unless<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.280> dig<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.909> deep<00:01:15.299> enough<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
unless you dig down deep enough to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.190 
unless you dig down deep enough to
expose<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> core<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
expose the core you see the one on the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.370 
expose the core you see the one on the
right<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> square<00:01:20.430> core<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.259> on

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
right is a square core and the one on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.460 
right is a square core and the one on
the<00:01:22.530> left<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.610> rectangular<00:01:24.470> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the left is more of a rectangular it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.100 
the left is more of a rectangular it
really<00:01:25.950> doesn't<00:01:26.400> matter<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.509> start<00:01:27.930> out

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
really doesn't matter how you start out

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
really doesn't matter how you start out
but<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> rectangular<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.180> likely

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
but the rectangular one is more likely

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
but the rectangular one is more likely
to<00:01:30.720> show<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> grip<00:01:31.560> part<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to show up in the grip part of the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.499 
to show up in the grip part of the
handle<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> gets<00:01:33.240> thinner

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
handle as you can see it gets thinner

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
handle as you can see it gets thinner
and<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> rectangular<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.310> might<00:01:35.579> stick<00:01:35.909> out

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and so a rectangular one might stick out

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
and so a rectangular one might stick out
far<00:01:36.390> enough<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.140> picked<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.650> when<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.860> turn

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
far enough to be picked up when you turn

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.550 
far enough to be picked up when you turn
it<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> process<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:41.060> laminating<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> core<00:01:42.560> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it the process of laminating the core is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410 
it the process of laminating the core is
probably<00:01:44.040> fairly<00:01:44.490> easy<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> just

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
probably fairly easy to see if you just

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
probably fairly easy to see if you just
look<00:01:45.630> down<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> end<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> them

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
look down the end there's two of them

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.760 
look down the end there's two of them
for<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.780> you'll<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
for you you'll see that the one on the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.800 
for you you'll see that the one on the
bottom<00:01:49.920> started<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.689> less

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
bottom started out with a more or less

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
bottom started out with a more or less
rectangular<00:01:52.619> core<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> top<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
rectangular core the one on the top is

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.330 
rectangular core the one on the top is
fairly<00:01:55.470> square<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.009> start

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
fairly square as you can see you start

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.300 
fairly square as you can see you start
sequencing<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.659> laminations<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
sequencing out with laminations of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.740 
sequencing out with laminations of
various<00:02:03.270> woods<00:02:03.540> fairly<00:02:04.140> thin<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:05.750> will

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
various woods fairly thin that will

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.419 
various woods fairly thin that will
bring<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> diameter<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> more

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
bring out the diameter more and more

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
bring out the diameter more and more
with<00:02:08.789> each<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.270> tend<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> drive<00:02:10.140> them<00:02:10.379> out

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
with each one I tend to drive them out

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.809 
with each one I tend to drive them out
to<00:02:11.250> about<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.970> quarter<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.450> two

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
to about two and a quarter to two

to about two and a quarter to two
1/2<00:02:13.239> inch<00:02:13.590> square<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.879> I<00:02:16.030> can<00:02:16.209> trim<00:02:16.450> it

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
1/2 inch square and then I can trim it

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.629 
1/2 inch square and then I can trim it
down<00:02:16.629> usually<00:02:17.499> the<00:02:17.799> handles<00:02:18.159> that<00:02:18.219> won't<00:02:18.459> make

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:18.639 
down usually the handles that won't make

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.970 
down usually the handles that won't make
more<00:02:18.939> than<00:02:19.120> 2<00:02:19.299> inches<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:19.989> at<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.530> maximum

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
more than 2 inches or so at the maximum

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.949 
more than 2 inches or so at the maximum
diameter<00:02:21.519> but<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:22.359> up<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.629> you<00:02:22.719> if<00:02:22.840> you're

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
diameter but it's up to you if you're

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.179 
diameter but it's up to you if you're
going<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.139> use<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.469> for<00:02:23.709> something<00:02:23.950> other

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
going to use this for something other

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.569 
going to use this for something other
than<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.760> tool<00:02:25.299> handle<00:02:25.719> maybe<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.579> toothpick

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
than a tool handle maybe like toothpick

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.770 
than a tool handle maybe like toothpick
holders<00:02:27.969> or<00:02:28.389> oh<00:02:30.120> maybe<00:02:31.120> salt<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.599> pepper

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
holders or oh maybe salt and pepper

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.470 
holders or oh maybe salt and pepper
grinders<00:02:32.409> you<00:02:33.219> might<00:02:33.430> want<00:02:33.670> larger<00:02:34.030> diameter

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
grinders you might want larger diameter

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.000 
grinders you might want larger diameter
so<00:02:34.689> you<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.019> continue<00:02:35.230> out<00:02:35.620> until<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:35.950> get

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
so you just continue out until you get

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.580 
so you just continue out until you get
through<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.280> diameter<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.030> want<00:02:37.590> part

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
through the diameter that you want part

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.059 
through the diameter that you want part
of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> trick<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.310> giving<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.019> equal<00:02:41.019> all<00:02:41.829> the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
of the trick is giving it equal all the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.789 
of the trick is giving it equal all the
way<00:02:42.249> out<00:02:42.430> from<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> center<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.439> when<00:02:44.650> you

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
way out from the center so that when you

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.240 
way out from the center so that when you
turn<00:02:45.219> it<00:02:45.400> you'll<00:02:46.329> have<00:02:46.629> a<00:02:46.689> nice<00:02:47.109> balance<00:02:47.439> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
turn it you'll have a nice balance to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.890 
turn it you'll have a nice balance to
the<00:02:48.340> final<00:02:48.669> turn<00:02:48.909> piece<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.540> you'll<00:02:49.659> get<00:02:49.840> a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
the final turn piece and you'll get a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.830 
the final turn piece and you'll get a
very<00:02:50.230> nice<00:02:50.439> symmetry<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.599> course

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
very nice symmetry that of course

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.159 
very nice symmetry that of course
requires<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.949> the<00:02:54.370> woods<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.359> use<00:02:55.599> are

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
requires that the woods that you use are

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.649 
requires that the woods that you use are
equal<00:02:57.069> on<00:02:57.189> both<00:02:57.219> sides<00:02:57.730> as<00:02:57.939> you<00:02:58.060> laminate<00:02:58.510> them

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
equal on both sides as you laminate them

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.979 
equal on both sides as you laminate them
out<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.909> next<00:03:01.090> part<00:03:01.449> as<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.659> can<00:03:01.810> see

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
out and the next part as you can see

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.369 
out and the next part as you can see
will<00:03:02.500> be<00:03:02.530> trimming<00:03:03.129> as<00:03:03.760> an<00:03:04.030> issue<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:05.139> piece

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
will be trimming as an issue the piece

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.490 
will be trimming as an issue the piece
on<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.709> top<00:03:05.949> is<00:03:06.370> ready<00:03:06.699> to<00:03:06.909> be<00:03:07.060> trimmed<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:08.650> the

on the top is ready to be trimmed to the
this<00:03:11.500> section<00:03:12.040> right<00:03:12.219> here<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.659> thin<00:03:14.109> piece

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
this section right here is a thin piece

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.619 
this section right here is a thin piece
of<00:03:14.379> wood<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> want<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.669> trim<00:03:15.909> these<00:03:16.269> top

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
of wood that I want to trim these top

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.339 
of wood that I want to trim these top
and<00:03:16.870> bottom<00:03:17.169> pieces<00:03:17.379> too<00:03:17.859> as<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.109> imagine

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
and bottom pieces too as you can imagine

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.170 
and bottom pieces too as you can imagine
that's<00:03:20.829> going<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.129> be<00:03:21.220> fairly<00:03:21.489> tricky<00:03:21.849> when

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
that's going to be fairly tricky when

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.949 
that's going to be fairly tricky when
you<00:03:22.359> glue<00:03:23.259> these<00:03:23.500> up<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.189> laminations<00:03:24.959> have

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
you glue these up the laminations have

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.800 
you glue these up the laminations have
to<00:03:26.169> overlap<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.209> overlap<00:03:28.209> will<00:03:28.599> never

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
to overlap and that overlap will never

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.030 
to overlap and that overlap will never
be<00:03:29.019> perfect<00:03:29.319> or<00:03:29.859> even<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:32.019> I've<00:03:32.319> developed<00:03:32.739> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
be perfect or even but I've developed a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.949 
be perfect or even but I've developed a
little<00:03:33.189> jig<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:34.030> will<00:03:34.180> make<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.569> trimming

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
little jig that will make the trimming

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.679 
little jig that will make the trimming
easier<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.889> can<00:03:36.009> be<00:03:36.099> done<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.729> a<00:03:36.790> table<00:03:37.239> saw<00:03:37.449> and

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
easier it can be done on a table saw and

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.740 
easier it can be done on a table saw and
I'll<00:03:37.930> show<00:03:38.139> you<00:03:38.199> that<00:03:38.439> next<00:03:42.359> well<00:03:43.359> now<00:03:43.479> I<00:03:43.540> want

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
I'll show you that next well now I want

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.439 
I'll show you that next well now I want
to<00:03:43.870> show<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.109> how<00:03:44.409> I'm<00:03:44.530> going<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.829> trim<00:03:45.099> this

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
to show you how I'm going to trim this

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.839 
to show you how I'm going to trim this
laminated<00:03:46.449> blank<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.220> surfaces<00:03:48.669> I

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
laminated blank to the surfaces I

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.640 
laminated blank to the surfaces I
mentioned<00:03:49.239> before<00:03:49.329> which<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.290> trim<00:03:50.530> it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
mentioned before which is the trim it

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.599 
mentioned before which is the trim it
flush<00:03:50.939> to<00:03:51.939> the<00:03:51.970> surface<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.229> surface<00:03:53.609> as

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
flush to the surface and the surface as

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.689 
flush to the surface and the surface as
you<00:03:54.759> can<00:03:54.909> see<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.989> overhangs<00:03:56.739> there<00:03:57.189> overlaps

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
you can see the overhangs there overlaps

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.469 
you can see the overhangs there overlaps
or<00:03:58.169> uneven<00:03:59.169> so<00:04:00.009> I<00:04:00.040> can't<00:04:00.370> just<00:04:00.579> put<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.879> on<00:04:01.030> my

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
or uneven so I can't just put it on my

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.189 
or uneven so I can't just put it on my
rip<00:04:02.079> fence<00:04:02.109> and<00:04:02.889> trim<00:04:03.219> it<00:04:03.250> off<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.669> the<00:04:03.759> blade

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
rip fence and trim it off to the blade

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.749 
rip fence and trim it off to the blade
because<00:04:05.199> then<00:04:05.439> it'll<00:04:05.590> be<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.889> even<00:04:06.129> relative

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
because then it'll be on even relative

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.929 
because then it'll be on even relative
to<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.060> what<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.840> want<00:04:08.079> to<00:04:08.169> do<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.409> register

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
to this what I want to do is register

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.399 
to this what I want to do is register
the<00:04:09.939> surface<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.620> blade<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:14.199> way<00:04:14.349> to

the surface to the blade and the way to

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.890 
the surface to the blade and the way to
do<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:15.009> is<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.789> build<00:04:15.969> a<00:04:16.120> special<00:04:16.299> fixture

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
do that is to build a special fixture

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.699 
do that is to build a special fixture
which<00:04:17.049> I've<00:04:17.229> done<00:04:17.469> and<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.820> right<00:04:19.060> here

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
which I've done and it's this right here

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.390 
which I've done and it's this right here
this<00:04:20.709> fixture

it<00:05:55.849> on<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:57.080> do<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.220> trip<00:05:58.460> let's<00:05:58.760> see<00:05:58.970> how<00:05:59.090> it

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
it on and do the trip let's see how it

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:32.280 
it on and do the trip let's see how it
comes<00:05:59.389> out
