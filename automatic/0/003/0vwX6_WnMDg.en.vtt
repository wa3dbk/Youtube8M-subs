00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.140
 hi to all and mafia stenting i hope 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.060
 that you're fine today we get 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.170
 find for a top 10 the top 10 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.190
 best clips of the week and 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.570
 today I think it's one of 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.070
 best top 10 I've ever done 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.020
 so you'll see it's clips 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.400
 really totally amazing are 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.939
 nothing to say so I hope you go 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.650
 appreciate these parties ok we start at the 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.570
 10th place with solution at home 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.370
 if we can call it a stunt or a bug 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.650
 watch he tapped the train with his bmx 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.000
 credible escaut he will stay stuck 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.739
 between the bar and the train like that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.150
 so here I am mii 10th because I 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.410
 do not know if it really is a stunt or 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.199
 not and on top of that he nearly 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.640
 reception but we played anyway 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.170
 still continues with bmx and and 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.489
 birds in ninth place that will us 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.260
 to make a very beautiful web watching 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.120
 he will go from one bar to another on 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.399
 the bike frame and then he goes 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.609
 finish in haendel are 80 I do not know 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.739
 what but it was well played number 8 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.239
 with nose to hd and a cabbage elbow clip 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.590
 so it's going to be a wonderful jump except 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.850
 he has already returned he seems to me 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.960
 that's why I could not classify 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.820
 better but he was so beautiful 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 I was obliged to 2 m they played well 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.070
 to you today there is a lot of bmx 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.570
 and my junior tony I think that's the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.780
 better today in bmx he pumped 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 on a train and watch that haendel 180 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.659
 he picked up a small bar jump on 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.009
 the train is then missed rice parterre 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.180
 Frankly it was nice to you 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.590
 we continue with very heavy 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.240
 sixth place major read a thousand 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.439
 arriving at cabbage elbow and look at me 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.390
 impressed anyway with his clip 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.189
 it's a new spot he's typed this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.229
 rebound is customary to make a huge in 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.060
 want and just stunned on this 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 building it was never done so you 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.900
 watch his boom he will pass stack in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
 under the truck with my tank 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.990
 it was really close was 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.060

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.100

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.409
 impressive look at it he's going 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.180
 to take that varied back up in 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.080
 rubber and look at the way 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.550
 they arrive on the building 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.899
 he's still jumping on it and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.550
 land on it so frankly that's 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 this week even more demented 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.989
 plachta that watching it's going to take a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 foaming bath flap of this colony 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.519
 to do a huge theft and all that for 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.569
 to go to land on an antenna finally I 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.100
 I mean, it's not possible 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.900
 that's exactly what it's doing it's a 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.100
 huge jump frankly congratulations to you 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.110

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.459
 tons brasilians looked at that he's gonna 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.690
 go maaf like from the mount 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.400
 Chilean I made some cuts 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.959
 in the video otherwise you risk yourself 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.489
 to bore a little bit so here it goes 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.989
 quietly head towards the city 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.220
 to watch I did a lot of 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.530
 cut because it's a very jump 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.670
 long and he will arrive to receive 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.350
 so there he will lose some speed 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.820
 by putting a little more back in 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.769
 eelv has received on the mass bank 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.150
 arena between the bars frankly you 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.720

 first place there is nothing to say he is 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.950
 maybe a little bit less 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.030
 impressive that the second one that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.069
 you saw right before but then 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.780

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.989
 the r land on a chimney 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.489
 frankly it took 40 hours for the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.140
 do that deserves his first 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.480
