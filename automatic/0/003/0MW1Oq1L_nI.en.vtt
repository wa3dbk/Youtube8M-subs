00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.440
 the goal is already to try to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.710
 do as well as last year 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.960
 since we were qualified 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 it will be always more complicated to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 season in season because because the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 federal one 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.960
 increases in quality and quantity if we 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.270
 is well positioned in relation to the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.230
 maintenance after we 'll see that moment if 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.480
 we can really qualify 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.360
 dakar and how did the months of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.300
 preparation very well we started the at 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.710
 from the 23rd of June we understood very 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.360
 very listened to in the goals because 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.780
 that he knows a little change in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 the star since stÃ©phane barberena was 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.900
 replaced by david shea laperne 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 so it took 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 take one's bearings there knowledge 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the group by david which they 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.540
 knew that he 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 replayed years ago had when 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.020
 even a work concludes it took 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.240
 integrate all these boys it was good 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.330
 past that end in three matches 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.700
 three friendlies for good there are 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.340
 well spent in the behavior of the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.620
 player after the temperament hinges rumba 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 date and we go it's jean de luz but 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.200
 in the behavior was satisfactory 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.490
 she lives very beautiful things with 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.330
 boys who really have same time and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.530
 and start with us it's always us 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.140
 set a permanent challenge 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.060
 I think you've already mentioned the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.410
 sports challenge 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 jean paul work is simple 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.060
 after there are other challenges that are 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 permanent also I speak about the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.070
 challenge in terms of budget that's because 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.310
 is there 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 and yet anyway the showcase team on 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.970
 is in general competition one so is 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.150
 a 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.580
 a category that is becoming 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.390
 more 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.730
 professionalize with budgets 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.950
 always on the rise in any case for 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.770
 some for some clubs are already 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.170
 in search configuration is in 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.470
 political configuration of goals to 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.440
 you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.870
 we try to hold our ram in 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 this environment there and it's not 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.600
 always easy 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.060
 obviously we try to be always 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.200
 true to a certain culture by the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.830
 force of things because my players 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.340
 are amateurs 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.040
 and then here we try we will try 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.650
 I hope in any case these two men 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.709
 gatekeepers to the web via the colors of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 fecal colors eager to start 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.550
 this championship to embark on a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620
 new adventure with a new group 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.360
 had some reinforcements is very 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.010
 interesting because seasons now he 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.540
 tells us about gauging ourselves in relation to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
 this vinci team manages it 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.440
 you too to make the right choices but 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.150
 me the troops of Philippe Chevrier 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.330
 now I hope the results 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.890
 on o 1 like that the more we will go damage 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.000
 earlier in the season the more we can 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.220
 work calmly and in the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.239
 trust could do as well 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.239
 even better than last year
