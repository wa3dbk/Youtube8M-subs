piece I started off by drawing out my
polar<00:00:18.000> bear<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> then<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.020> used<00:00:19.230> masking<00:00:19.830> fluid

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
polar bear and then I used masking fluid

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189 
polar bear and then I used masking fluid
that<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> painted<00:00:20.789> over<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> entire<00:00:21.600> bear<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
then I airbrushed my background using a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.929 
then I airbrushed my background using a
stencil<00:00:24.720> once<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.890> done<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.369> removed<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
stencil once that was done I removed the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
stencil once that was done I removed the
masking<00:00:27.269> fluid<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:28.170> colored<00:00:28.470> pencil<00:00:28.890> for

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039

the rest of the bear I used both

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060 
the rest of the bear I used both

this the one tip I have for you guys is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
this the one tip I have for you guys is
when<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.800> working<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.250> animals<00:00:35.700> with

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
when you are working on animals with

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
when you are working on animals with
light<00:00:36.090> fur<00:00:36.329> start<00:00:36.989> off<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.770> lighter<00:00:38.040> than

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
light fur start off a lot lighter than

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.560 
light fur start off a lot lighter than
you<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.670> gonna<00:00:38.820> need<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you think you're gonna need to go and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.450 
you think you're gonna need to go and
slowly<00:00:39.960> darken<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.070> really

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
slowly darken it up because it is really

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
slowly darken it up because it is really
hard<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:42.180> working<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.629> colored<00:00:42.870> pencils<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
hard when working in colored pencils to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170 
hard when working in colored pencils to
get<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.829> light<00:00:44.040> firm<00:00:44.340> backlight

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
get the really light firm backlight

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
get the really light firm backlight
enough<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.500> tips<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:47.100> second

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
enough I like I have two tips my second

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.000 
enough I like I have two tips my second
tip<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.750> most<00:00:49.230> white<00:00:49.530> animals

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
tip for you is that most white animals

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
tip for you is that most white animals
aren't<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:50.940> white<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.719> are

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
aren't actually white when you are
