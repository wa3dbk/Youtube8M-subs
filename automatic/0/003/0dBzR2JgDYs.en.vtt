get them out of that hazard zone and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.080 
get them out of that hazard zone and
it's<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> most<00:01:12.869> challenging<00:01:13.530> dangerous

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's the most challenging dangerous

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's the most challenging dangerous
episodic<00:01:15.090> exciting<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:16.189> of<00:01:17.189> anything<00:01:18.090> we

episodic exciting time of anything we

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.270 
episodic exciting time of anything we
manage<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.799> we're

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
manage really it's in the very we're

manage really it's in the very we're
going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> OK<00:01:21.119> Corral<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.780> we're<00:01:22.380> gonna

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
going to the OK Corral and we're gonna

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to the OK Corral and we're gonna
in<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.220> minute<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> half<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.060> gun<00:01:24.240> fights<00:01:24.479> over

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
in a minute and a half a gun fights over

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.679 
in a minute and a half a gun fights over
almost<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.549> translated<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> into

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
almost but it's translated in that into

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
almost but it's translated in that into
our<00:01:27.780> terms<00:01:28.110> well<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> things<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
our terms well and one of the things I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
our terms well and one of the things I
think<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.729> especially<00:01:30.180> important<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
think was especially important was the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
think was especially important was the
modern<00:01:32.310> building<00:01:32.729> techniques<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.479> how

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
modern building techniques and how

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
modern building techniques and how
they've<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:33.990> affected<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
they've really affected really a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.039 
they've really affected really a
compression<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:36.840> frame

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
compression of that time frame

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.510 
compression of that time frame
absolutely<00:01:37.799> looking<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.159> lightweight

progression<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.860> sort<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.280> nice<00:01:53.430> gradual

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
progression was sort of a nice gradual

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
progression was sort of a nice gradual
sort<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> thing<00:01:54.659> now<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.049> almost<00:01:55.439> vertical

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
sort of thing now it's almost vertical

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.889 
sort of thing now it's almost vertical
and<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.820> get<00:01:57.000> caught<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.659> vertical

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and if you get caught in that vertical

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
and if you get caught in that vertical
fire<00:01:58.409> progression<00:01:59.100> sometimes<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> don't

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
fire progression sometimes you don't

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
fire progression sometimes you don't
survive<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> incident

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
survive it so this is what that incident

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
survive it so this is what that incident
commander<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.880> trying<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> manage<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> it's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
commander is trying to manage and it's

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.139 
commander is trying to manage and it's
really<00:02:04.619> challenging<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.460> exciting<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
really challenging and it's exciting and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.169 
really challenging and it's exciting and
they're<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:07.049> capable<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.700> skillful<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they're very capable and skillful and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.460 
they're very capable and skillful and
all<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.720> need<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.989> help<00:02:10.140> them<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
all that but we need to help them and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.570 
all that but we need to help them and
provide<00:02:10.739> more<00:02:10.890> information

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
provide more information

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.120 
provide more information
support<00:02:12.230> practice<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.680> sort<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.010> thing

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
support practice and that sort of thing

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.380 
support practice and that sort of thing
we're<00:02:14.340> using<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> lot<00:02:14.850> more<00:02:15.030> high<00:02:15.210> fidelity

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
we're using a lot more high fidelity

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.010 
we're using a lot more high fidelity
simulations<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.850> practice<00:02:17.850> part<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
simulations in the practice part the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.810 
simulations in the practice part the
procedures<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.920> got<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.340> fast-tracked

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
procedures have got to be fast-tracked

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.660 
procedures have got to be fast-tracked
we're<00:02:21.390> gonna<00:02:21.540> thin<00:02:21.870> slice<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.800> standard<00:02:23.430> job

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
we're gonna thin slice the standard job

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.160 
we're gonna thin slice the standard job
of<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.630> what<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.870> would<00:02:25.020> do

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
of that I see and what we would do

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
of that I see and what we would do
normally<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.740> 15<00:02:26.100> or<00:02:26.220> 20<00:02:26.520> minutes<00:02:26.670> unless<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
normally in 15 or 20 minutes unless you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.990 
normally in 15 or 20 minutes unless you
got<00:02:27.330> doing<00:02:27.570> two<00:02:27.780> minutes<00:02:28.140> boss<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.790> whole

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
got doing two minutes boss this whole

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.040 
got doing two minutes boss this whole
thing<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.360> two<00:02:33.540> minutes

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
thing in two minutes

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.070 
thing in two minutes
well<00:02:34.680> yeah<00:02:35.360> two<00:02:36.360> minutes<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.690> got<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> figure

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
well yeah two minutes you got to figure

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.330 
well yeah two minutes you got to figure
out<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.470> ought<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:38.100> are<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
out if you ought to be in there are you

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.910 
out if you ought to be in there are you
shouldn't<00:02:38.960> now<00:02:39.960> sometimes<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.500> isn't<00:02:40.650> that

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
shouldn't now sometimes it isn't that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.500 
shouldn't now sometimes it isn't that
quick<00:02:41.160> but<00:02:41.310> sometimes<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.270> you're<00:02:42.420> in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
quick but sometimes it is if you're in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.970 
quick but sometimes it is if you're in
the<00:02:42.600> middle<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.020> beginning<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.650> going

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the middle of the beginning it is going

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.430 
the middle of the beginning it is going
quick<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:45.540> you're<00:02:45.690> behind<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.230> power

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
quick and if you're behind that power

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.290 
quick and if you're behind that power
curve<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:47.130> may<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.490> survive<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> mean<00:02:48.150> your

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
curve you may not survive it I mean your

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.940 
curve you may not survive it I mean your
troops<00:02:48.600> may<00:02:48.780> not<00:02:48.990> survive<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
troops may not survive it so that's a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.290 
troops may not survive it so that's a
pretty<00:02:50.360> pretty<00:02:51.360> high<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.900> stress<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.860> I

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
pretty pretty high I stress if I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.910 
pretty pretty high I stress if I
performance<00:02:54.300> kind<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:55.110> requirement<00:02:55.830> for

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
performance kind of a requirement for

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.430 
performance kind of a requirement for
that<00:02:55.980> incident<00:02:56.430> command<00:02:56.700> system<00:02:57.380> do<00:02:58.380> you

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that incident command system do you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.710 
that incident command system do you
think<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.830> some<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.690> technologies<00:03:00.690> that

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
think that some of the technologies that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.350 
think that some of the technologies that
are<00:03:00.930> available<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.770> basically<00:03:02.430> get<00:03:02.760> people<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
are available to basically get people to

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.100 
are available to basically get people to
practice<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:04.110> decision-making<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.730> very

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
practice that decision-making in a very

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.630 
practice that decision-making in a very
accurately<00:03:07.110> simulated<00:03:07.620> environment<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:08.459> that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
accurately simulated environment is that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.740 
accurately simulated environment is that
gonna<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> lot<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.690> be

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
gonna have a lot of in it's going to be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.600 
gonna have a lot of in it's going to be
better<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.140> better<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.440> think<00:03:10.740> we're<00:03:11.310> looking

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
better and better I think we're looking

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.220 
better and better I think we're looking
at<00:03:11.760> high<00:03:11.910> fidelity<00:03:12.120> simulations<00:03:13.050> we're

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
at high fidelity simulations we're

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.990 
at high fidelity simulations we're
looking<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:13.620> better<00:03:13.800> media<00:03:14.190> management<00:03:14.610> in

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
looking at better media management in

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.550 
looking at better media management in
other<00:03:15.120> words<00:03:15.330> were<00:03:15.450> looking<00:03:15.720> at<00:03:15.840> simulations

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
other words were looking at simulations

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770 
other words were looking at simulations
where<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.459> can<00:03:17.610> practice<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.180> with<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
where you can practice that with the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.800 
where you can practice that with the
real<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.739> real<00:03:19.769> stuff<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:21.209> simulated

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
real the real stuff in a simulated

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
environment where you don't have to be

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.009 
environment where you don't have to be
perfect<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.120> make<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.300> mistake<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.900> get

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
perfect if you make a mistake you get

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.050 
perfect if you make a mistake you get
coached<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.560> learn<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.430> ya<00:03:26.790> know

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
coached you learn more and so on ya know

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.699 
coached you learn more and so on ya know
and<00:03:27.750> that's<00:03:28.019> what<00:03:28.170> we<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.530> take

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and that's what we have to take

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.340 
and that's what we have to take
advantage<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.540> places<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.200> got

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
advantage of to places like this you got

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.550 
advantage of to places like this you got
vote<00:03:31.560> X<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:32.040> are<00:03:32.070> very<00:03:32.400> very<00:03:32.730> sophisticated

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
that process go quicker we have to take

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.650 
that process go quicker we have to take
our<00:05:31.650> operational<00:05:32.520> systems<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.150> open<00:05:33.420> it<00:05:33.540> up

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
our operational systems and open it up

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.390

to that information in order we have to

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.280 
to that information in order we have to

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
look at that fire testing they're doing

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.250 
look at that fire testing they're doing
we<00:05:37.440> need<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.710> look<00:05:37.890> at<00:05:38.100> that<00:05:38.310> at<00:05:39.180> more<00:05:39.540> science

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
we need to look at that at more science

we all have our specialties but we have

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.890 
we all have our specialties but we have
to<00:06:20.040> become<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.490> lot<00:06:20.790> more<00:06:20.820> sophisticated<00:06:21.690> in

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
to become a lot more sophisticated in

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.470 
to become a lot more sophisticated in
accessing<00:06:22.500> that<00:06:22.860> kind<00:06:23.100> of<00:06:23.160> information<00:06:23.490> to

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
accessing that kind of information to

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.240 
accessing that kind of information to
translate<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.110> into<00:06:25.260> intelligence<00:06:25.980> that<00:06:26.100> we

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
translate it into intelligence that we

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.210 
translate it into intelligence that we
can<00:06:26.430> use<00:06:26.640> on<00:06:26.850> the<00:06:26.880> fire<00:06:27.120> ground<00:06:27.860> and<00:06:28.860> so<00:06:29.070> we've

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
can use on the fire ground and so we've

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.160 
can use on the fire ground and so we've
got<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.490> kind<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.730> go<00:06:29.880> a<00:06:29.910> long<00:06:30.210> way<00:06:30.360> around<00:06:30.510> to

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
got to kind of go a long way around to

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.350 
got to kind of go a long way around to
be<00:06:31.620> able<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:32.040> do<00:06:32.220> that<00:06:32.460> in<00:06:32.700> that<00:06:32.850> compressed

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
be able to do that in that compressed

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.630 
be able to do that in that compressed
time<00:06:33.630> frame<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:34.350> we<00:06:34.890> may<00:06:35.070> have<00:06:35.100> to<00:06:35.280> step<00:06:35.580> down

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
time frame so we may have to step down

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.340 
time frame so we may have to step down
five<00:06:36.240> years<00:06:36.750> so<00:06:36.990> that<00:06:37.110> week

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
five years so that week

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.650 
five years so that week
make<00:06:37.500> a<00:06:37.530> decision<00:06:38.070> in<00:06:38.190> two<00:06:38.610> minutes<00:06:38.850> yeah<00:06:39.270> you

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
make a decision in two minutes yeah you

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.330 
make a decision in two minutes yeah you
know<00:06:39.750> it's<00:06:40.140> like<00:06:40.260> that<00:06:40.410> guy<00:06:40.620> said<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:41.010> took<00:06:41.160> me

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
know it's like that guy said it took me

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.800 
know it's like that guy said it took me
took<00:06:41.610> me<00:06:41.790> 40<00:06:42.120> years<00:06:42.150> to<00:06:42.420> be<00:06:42.630> an<00:06:42.720> overnight

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
took me 40 years to be an overnight

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.120 
took me 40 years to be an overnight
success<00:06:43.520> well<00:06:44.810> but<00:06:45.810> because<00:06:46.320> it's<00:06:46.590> over<00:06:46.830> quick

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
success well but because it's over quick

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.960 
success well but because it's over quick
when<00:06:47.700> we<00:06:47.820> go<00:06:47.940> to<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.150> OK<00:06:48.390> Corral<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:49.860> so<00:06:50.790> be

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
when we go to the OK Corral and so be

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.030 
when we go to the OK Corral and so be
that's<00:06:51.210> a<00:06:51.300> challenge<00:06:51.750> for<00:06:51.960> us<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.350> you<00:06:52.890> know<00:06:52.950> I

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
that's a challenge for us to you know I

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.710 
that's a challenge for us to you know I
think<00:06:53.130> experience<00:06:53.730> we<00:06:54.120> need<00:06:54.240> we<00:06:54.510> need<00:06:54.690> to

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
think experience we need we need to

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.240 
think experience we need we need to
package<00:06:55.020> up<00:06:55.290> experience<00:06:55.890> in<00:06:56.040> a<00:06:56.100> more

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
package up experience in a more

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.460 
package up experience in a more
transferable<00:06:56.970> kind<00:06:57.210> of<00:06:57.300> way<00:06:57.420> where<00:06:58.350> you've

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
transferable kind of way where you've

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.200 
transferable kind of way where you've
got<00:06:58.620> these<00:06:58.770> old<00:06:59.040> guys<00:06:59.250> that<00:06:59.610> have<00:06:59.730> seen<00:06:59.940> a<00:06:59.970> lot

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
got these old guys that have seen a lot

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.090 
got these old guys that have seen a lot
of<00:07:00.240> buildings<00:07:00.750> burned<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:01.620> you<00:07:01.710> got<00:07:01.860> a<00:07:01.890> lot<00:07:02.070> of

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
of buildings burned and you got a lot of

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.770 
of buildings burned and you got a lot of
young<00:07:02.340> people<00:07:02.760> coming<00:07:03.000> into<00:07:03.210> the<00:07:03.360> service

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
young people coming into the service

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.360 
young people coming into the service
we've<00:07:04.350> got<00:07:04.560> to<00:07:04.680> be<00:07:04.800> able<00:07:04.890> to<00:07:05.040> somehow

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
we've got to be able to somehow

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.550 
we've got to be able to somehow
translate<00:07:05.910> that<00:07:06.150> experience<00:07:06.720> into<00:07:06.900> useable

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
translate that experience into useable

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320 
translate that experience into useable
terms<00:07:07.830> for<00:07:08.130> these<00:07:08.280> kids<00:07:08.610> and<00:07:08.850> I<00:07:08.910> say<00:07:09.120> that

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330
