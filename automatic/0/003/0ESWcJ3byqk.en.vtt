fixed<00:00:11.130> down<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.610> idea<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.389> going<00:00:12.570> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
fixed down the idea is that I'm going to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.560 
fixed down the idea is that I'm going to
travel<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.190> panel<00:00:14.549> inside<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> camper

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
travel with the panel inside the camper

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.029 
travel with the panel inside the camper
and<00:00:15.599> when<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> got<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.139> site<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.619> will<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:16.859> lay

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and when I got on site it will just lay

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.890 
and when I got on site it will just lay
on<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.670> can't<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.240> being<00:00:18.420> blown<00:00:18.690> off

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
on here I can't see it being blown off

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480 
on here I can't see it being blown off
it's<00:00:19.140> quite<00:00:19.320> heavy<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.920> supported<00:00:20.460> by

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it's quite heavy and it's supported by

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.679 
it's quite heavy and it's supported by
voice<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.150> central<00:00:21.660> ridge<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.859> skylight

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
voice the central ridge and a skylight

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.939 
voice the central ridge and a skylight
I've<00:00:24.689> cut<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.080> notch<00:00:25.199> there<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
I've cut a little notch there so that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
I've cut a little notch there so that
the<00:00:26.010> cables<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.580> come<00:00:26.789> out<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.119> it'll<00:00:27.210> it's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the cables can come out and it'll it's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.640 
the cables can come out and it'll it's
allowing<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.380> flush<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:30.650> connectors

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
allowing it to be flush the connectors

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
allowing it to be flush the connectors
right<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.820> which<00:00:33.540> run<00:00:33.840> down<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> way

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
right here which run down are the way

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.910 
right here which run down are the way
I've<00:00:34.710> wired<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.960> if<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.320> come<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> any

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
I've wired this if I just come to any

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.729 
I've wired this if I just come to any
steps<00:00:38.750> now<00:00:39.750> there<00:00:39.930> goes<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.309> gas<00:00:41.910> bottle

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
steps now there goes into the gas bottle

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.500 
steps now there goes into the gas bottle
container<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> disconnect<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> cable

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
container so when I disconnect the cable

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
container so when I disconnect the cable
I<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.230> coil<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> put<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> safely

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I can coil it all up and put it safely

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.279 
I can coil it all up and put it safely
inside<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> box<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> runs

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
inside the box and then it runs

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.100 
inside the box and then it runs
underneath<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.039> van<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:53.449> they<00:00:54.449> disappear

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
underneath the van and they disappear

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.470 
underneath the van and they disappear
inside<00:00:57.469> underneath<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.670> battery<00:01:00.059> box<00:01:00.239> I've

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
inside underneath the battery box I've

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760 
inside underneath the battery box I've
got<00:01:00.629> everything<00:01:00.989> running<00:01:01.500> through<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
got everything running through a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.920 
got everything running through a
waterproof<00:01:02.629> fuse<00:01:03.629> 5<00:01:04.470> amp<00:01:04.680> fuse<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.939> we've

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
waterproof fuse 5 amp fuse so that we've

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.080 
waterproof fuse 5 amp fuse so that we've
just<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> protected<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> 12<00:01:08.340> volt<00:01:08.549> scares

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
just got it protected to 12 volt scares

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.219 
just got it protected to 12 volt scares
me<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.500> could<00:01:10.650> easily<00:01:10.860> catch<00:01:11.189> fire

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
me because it could easily catch fire

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
me because it could easily catch fire
but<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.710> wiring<00:01:13.950> badly<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
but if you do your wiring badly now in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
but if you do your wiring badly now in
here<00:01:15.420> I've<00:01:16.320> taken<00:01:16.650> over<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.610> cabinet<00:01:19.189> wholly

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
here I've taken over this cabinet wholly

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.719 
here I've taken over this cabinet wholly
doing<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> dance<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
doing a little bit of a dance so this is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
doing a little bit of a dance so this is
gonna<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.830> where<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> controller<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:27.409> let

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
gonna be the where the controller is let

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.050 
gonna be the where the controller is let
me<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> up

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
me just get it up

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.609 
me just get it up

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
so it's all backlit which I didn't

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.090

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
bit creased but that's because the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
over the winter and they just need to be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.190 
over the winter and they just need to be
draped<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.040> little<00:02:42.220> bit<00:02:42.340> more<00:02:42.549> also<00:02:43.390> I've<00:02:43.959> added

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
draped a little bit more also I've added

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.710 
draped a little bit more also I've added
just<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.130> little<00:02:45.160> bit<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.549> packing<00:02:45.760> underneath

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
just a little bit of packing underneath

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.199 
just a little bit of packing underneath
here<00:02:46.959> because<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.290> all<00:02:47.470> lifts<00:02:47.769> out<00:02:48.209> there's

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
here because this all lifts out there's

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.090 
here because this all lifts out there's
a<00:02:49.329> I<00:02:49.989> tend<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.410> get<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.680> bit<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.950> water

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
a I tend to get a little bit of water

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.590 
a I tend to get a little bit of water
from<00:02:51.489> your<00:02:51.579> drainage<00:02:51.790> coming<00:02:52.180> out<00:02:52.269> here<00:02:52.450> so

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
from your drainage coming out here so

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.890 
from your drainage coming out here so
I've<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:52.720> added<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.739> piece<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.780> bicycle<00:02:55.780> inner

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
I've just added a piece of bicycle inner

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
I've just added a piece of bicycle inner
tube<00:02:55.989> taped<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.950> make<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.280> seal<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.519> bit

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
tube taped up to make this to seal a bit

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.000 
tube taped up to make this to seal a bit
tighter<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:59.500> seems<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.769> work<00:02:59.950> quite

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
tighter and that seems to work quite

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.949 
tighter and that seems to work quite
well<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> latest<00:03:01.359> thing<00:03:01.600> we'll<00:03:01.870> be

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
well so that's the latest thing we'll be

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.420 
well so that's the latest thing we'll be
going<00:03:02.170> away<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.859> next<00:03:03.010> couple<00:03:03.280> of

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.789 
going away in this in the next couple of
weeks<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:04.930> trying<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.320> out<00:03:05.410> hopefully

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
weeks and then trying it out hopefully

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.310 
weeks and then trying it out hopefully
it<00:03:05.859> won't<00:03:05.920> be<00:03:06.010> too<00:03:06.070> cold<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:07.660> really<00:03:08.109> looking

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320
