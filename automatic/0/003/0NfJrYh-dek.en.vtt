not like for instance you know I've sort
of<00:02:19.160> been<00:02:19.250> thinking<00:02:19.460> about<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:19.970> question<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
of been thinking about this question a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.850 
of been thinking about this question a
lot<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.630> I've<00:02:20.870> been<00:02:20.900> thinking<00:02:21.320> why<00:02:21.440> people

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
lot and I've been thinking why people

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.360 
lot and I've been thinking why people
ask<00:02:22.010> me<00:02:22.220> me<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.880> know<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.080> happens<00:02:24.560> but

ask me me you know it just happens but
the<00:02:25.520> thing<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.090> because<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:26.810> have<00:02:27.080> an<00:02:27.200> instant

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the thing is because we have an instant

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.640 
the thing is because we have an instant
society<00:02:28.100> look<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.270> go<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.660> doctor<00:02:30.110> we

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
instantly lifted that's what a facelift

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.250 
instantly lifted that's what a facelift
does<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.850> that's<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.240> benefit<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.810> having<00:02:42.080> a
