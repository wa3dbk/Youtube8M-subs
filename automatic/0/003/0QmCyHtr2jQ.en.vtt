00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.550
 to 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.100
 because the history of the airway 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.530
 relatively short it is mounted more or less 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.450
 in the second half of the 20th century we can 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.240
 define aerobics as an exercise 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 Aerobic to burn fat accompanied by 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 music that is the most important and most 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.259
 novelty that aerobics has had and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.820
 always for health purposes he emerged more 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.009
 or less in the year 1988 in a doctor 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.449
 American called Kenneth Cooper 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.970
 he wrote a book on fundamentals of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.790
 training but it was not until a year 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.220
 later where jakes ourense based on 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 the book that Cooper had written added 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.810
 music and all your knowledge that already 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 had dance and so he created what more or 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.060
 less if we know how I saw it though 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.030
 has evolved over the years 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.420
 made famous especially with the video of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.280
 law and in Spain promoted it more 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.800
 a TV show that presented it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.380
 eva nasarre we say that the hoop had gone 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 evolving because before they were steps of 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.210
 high impact was seen to be aggressive 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.700
 for health damaged the knees and 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 now the monitors try to be 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 Steps 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.299
 impact at least the vast majority 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.100
 It has also evolved in terms of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.780
 the teaching before the hoop saw very 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.369
 simple they were simply 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.450
 displacements right left 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.920
 back and forth was explained in a way 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 simultaneous with the monitor simply the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.840
 final product now not now the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.450
 photographs are being more complicated 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.429
 there are twists changes of plane and also 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 especially the merger that you are seeing with 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.000
 the dance in aerobics as was done before 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.159
 they were very simple femoral knees 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.780
 then there came a moment that you 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.000
 it was without ideas and now it is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.789
 leading the merger as for example 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.600
 merge with the Latin aerolatino hoop 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.000
 jacques aro dance and we put on 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.979
 monitors have a great variety and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.539
 have classes with different styles 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.539
 and group a lot more people
