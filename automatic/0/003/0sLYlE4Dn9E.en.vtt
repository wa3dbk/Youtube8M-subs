00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.140 
the door and you just train that is so
so<00:01:52.150> easy<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.630> get<00:01:52.780> past<00:01:53.020> rounds<00:01:53.410> is

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
so easy to get past rounds is

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.780 
so easy to get past rounds is
unbelievably<00:01:55.150> easy<00:01:55.360> actually<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.520> is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
unbelievably easy actually and that is

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.580 
unbelievably easy actually and that is
probably<00:01:57.940> why<00:01:58.420> i<00:01:58.690> put<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.140> out<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> number

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
probably why i put it out the number

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.790 
probably why i put it out the number
four<00:01:59.770> spot<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.220> top<00:02:00.400> five<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.990> we<00:02:02.230> go<00:02:02.470> at

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
four spot in this top five here we go at

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.120 
four spot in this top five here we go at
their<00:02:03.130> number<00:02:03.700> three<00:02:04.030> spot<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.950> one

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
their number three spot we have the one

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.730 
their number three spot we have the one
and<00:02:06.280> only<00:02:06.340> buried<00:02:06.850> buried<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.720> super<00:02:08.410> super

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
and only buried buried is a super super

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.180 
and only buried buried is a super super
easy<00:02:08.770> map<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.490> i'll<00:02:09.910> tell<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:10.240> why<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.590> has

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
easy map and i'll tell you why this has

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.030 
easy map and i'll tell you why this has
a<00:02:12.489> lot<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.850> variety<00:02:13.480> similar<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.410> origins<00:02:14.920> this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
a lot of variety similar to origins this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.030 
a lot of variety similar to origins this
is<00:02:15.190> when<00:02:15.340> they<00:02:15.430> started<00:02:15.700> putting<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:16.000> lot<00:02:16.300> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
is when they started putting a lot of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.350 
is when they started putting a lot of
emphasis<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.160> their<00:02:18.340> creativity<00:02:18.820> into<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
emphasis of their creativity into the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.080 
emphasis of their creativity into the
maps<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:20.500> kind<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.770> worked<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:21.190> buried<00:02:21.520> not

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
maps and it kind of worked we buried not

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
maps and it kind of worked we buried not
in<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.420> challenging<00:02:22.870> way<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.350> an<00:02:23.500> easy<00:02:23.650> way

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
in a challenging way but an easy way

definitely not part of a fact this is an
incredibly<00:03:13.360> easy<00:03:13.600> map<00:03:13.840> that's<00:03:14.200> why<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.350> said

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
incredibly easy map that's why I said

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.220 
incredibly easy map that's why I said
the<00:03:14.680> number<00:03:14.890> three<00:03:15.040> spot<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:16.150> coming<00:03:16.840> in<00:03:16.960> at

darice<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.310> cannot<00:03:22.090> explain<00:03:22.330> how<00:03:22.570> easiest<00:03:22.990> map

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
darice I cannot explain how easiest map

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.830 
darice I cannot explain how easiest map
is<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.590> mean<00:03:23.860> all<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.760> maps<00:03:24.940> are<00:03:25.030> easy<00:03:25.360> but

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
is I mean all the maps are easy but

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.320 
is I mean all the maps are easy but
these<00:03:26.020> last<00:03:26.290> two<00:03:26.500> maps<00:03:26.740> are<00:03:27.280> just<00:03:27.490> incredibly

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
these last two maps are just incredibly

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.470 
these last two maps are just incredibly
easy<00:03:28.600> okay<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:30.040> map<00:03:30.340> had<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.880> be<00:03:31.000> any<00:03:31.330> I'm

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
easy okay this map had to be any I'm

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.390 
easy okay this map had to be any I'm
sorry<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:32.170> people<00:03:32.200> thought<00:03:32.710> wrong<00:03:32.950> but<00:03:33.220> this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400
