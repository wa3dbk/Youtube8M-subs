his<00:01:38.770> weapons<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.280> gold<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.860> can<00:01:42.069> see<00:01:42.280> I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
his weapons to gold like you can see I

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.620 
his weapons to gold like you can see I
give<00:01:43.060> him<00:01:43.149> raucous<00:01:43.599> paw<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.250> two<00:01:45.630> spikes

give him raucous paw and the two spikes

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.980 
give him raucous paw and the two spikes
like<00:01:46.840> he<00:01:47.020> has<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.319> his<00:01:47.349> normal<00:01:47.770> phone<00:01:48.009> except

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
like he has on his normal phone except

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.940 
like he has on his normal phone except
they're<00:01:49.990> in<00:01:50.140> gold<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:53.170> really<00:01:53.319> liking

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
they're in gold and I was really liking

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.109 
they're in gold and I was really liking
the<00:01:54.099> idea<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.759> seeing<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.520> gold<00:01:57.759> on<00:01:57.910> him

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
the idea of seeing that the gold on him

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.040 
the idea of seeing that the gold on him
I<00:01:58.300> think<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.539> match<00:01:58.690> really<00:01:59.080> good<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:01.270> was

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
I think I match really good so I was

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.240 
I think I match really good so I was
thinking<00:02:02.110> about<00:02:02.410> only<00:02:02.679> giving<00:02:02.920> him<00:02:03.009> um

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
thinking about only giving him um

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.300 
thinking about only giving him um
without<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.390> hand<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:05.410> then<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.709> just<00:02:05.739> formed

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
without the hand but then it just formed

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.300 
without the hand but then it just formed
too<00:02:06.610> much<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.270> similar<00:02:07.840> figure<00:02:08.110> 2<00:02:08.590> raka<00:02:08.890> with

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
too much of a similar figure 2 raka with

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.240 
too much of a similar figure 2 raka with
the<00:02:09.429> pop<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.569> scratched<00:02:11.230> for<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.650> idea<00:02:12.010> and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the pop so I scratched for that idea and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.199 
the pop so I scratched for that idea and
I<00:02:13.060> made<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.360> less<00:02:13.780> similar<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.530> added<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.209> this

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
I made it less similar and added on this

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.839 
I made it less similar and added on this
part<00:02:16.599> right<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.430> think<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.700> looks

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
part right here and I think it looks

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.290 
part right here and I think it looks
pretty<00:02:18.970> cool<00:02:20.220> having<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.489> backwards<00:02:21.910> actually

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
pretty cool having it backwards actually

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.260 
pretty cool having it backwards actually
forms<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.390> new<00:02:25.510> type<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.780> weapon<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.530> next<00:02:27.270> he

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
forms a new type of weapon for next he

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.870 
forms a new type of weapon for next he
also<00:02:28.950> scratches<00:02:29.950> all<00:02:30.160> his<00:02:30.370> orange<00:02:30.670> armor

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
also scratches all his orange armor

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.020 
also scratches all his orange armor
except<00:02:31.510> for<00:02:31.720> his<00:02:31.870> mask<00:02:32.230> because<00:02:33.040> he<00:02:33.490> keeps<00:02:33.730> his

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
except for his mask because he keeps his

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.640 
except for his mask because he keeps his
original<00:02:34.510> mask<00:02:34.750> from<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.050> three<00:02:35.350> point<00:02:35.380> i

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
mouths so there's much more symbolized

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.160 
mouths so there's much more symbolized
