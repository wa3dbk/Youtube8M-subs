00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello dear viewers with you is holy 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 and today but a completely different video is 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 reviews of gaming devices and today we 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.570
 on the operating table a mouse with kate at anki 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570
 about rulers call 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.779
 the mouse is considered the benchmark among 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.769
 professional players in 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.949
 counter-strike 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.339
 why is the mouse called light and this 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.769
 everything went from a series of mice and with one and 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.110
 the creators of which is emil 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.449
 christensen known as chiton 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.629
 also mice and mi. 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.120
 ok but we have a model in your hands 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.399
 how does she differ from her brother 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.890
 the muscles are pretty ordinary 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.789
 boxes without any sophistication all 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.789
 very simple 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.470
 comes with a logo sticker 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.800
 Za safe galaeva 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.450
 unlike their fellow earlier 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.729
 f-one models 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 has a slightly larger size designers 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.100
 thought about the players in the big palm and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 Now it will be easier to keep the mouse in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.290
 I have a medium palm so 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.600
 the mouse ideally sits in my hand with the mouse 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.270
 can use as right handed as 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.850
 left-handed muscle is symmetrical and there are both 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 sides on two buttons side buttons not 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 strongly pronounced on the body 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 it happens that the process of the game is not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.300
 can you understand or which button but i 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.229
 I think this is a matter of habit, I did not notice 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.289
 some backlash 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.869
 buttons if for example on to not soon 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.360
 just walked right and left the tones of the archive 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.530
 There are no such key clicks 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.910
 a little tight but I like it 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 prevents erroneous clicking on them 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.450
 although something I did not like is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 soft tap 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.810
 side buttons and a tight push scroll 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.200
 but in general 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.060
 the assembly is just great coverage 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.049
 is a granular 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600
 matte paint 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.979
 thanks to which it is provided 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.410
 reliable grip but this surface 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.079
 Marked enough dirty and greasy 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.360
 hands better not to touch my first 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.760
 experience was not a pleasant thought 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.970
 the mouse is about to slip but after 10 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.360
 minutes everything went I realized that the mouse is very 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.390
 okay all and sounds let's talk about cable and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.489
 the cable is elastic enough it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.070
 insulation made of dense 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.799
 material so don't worry he doesn't 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.130
 will fray over the edges and corners of the tables 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.640
 in contrast to the tissue as well as lashes 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.410
 there is a bend protection at the end of the cable 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.510
 Ferrite filter is located because they believe 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.400
 leaves noise and magnetic fields 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.340
 which positively affects the quality 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.019
 signal look in your armpit but what we 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.530
 immediately pay attention 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.280
 this button to switch dipia it 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.100
 has 4 modes 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:10.150
 these are 402 5,800 dipiai 1600 and 3200 and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.270
 frequency a 125 to 1000 hertz each mode 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.280
 now marked with its color is enough 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.560
 convenient for players who often 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.489
 going to tournaments is not possible 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 put wood and woods mouse very 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.200
 easy to use 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.560
 plug and play it has two big 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.620
 glide 1 front 2 rear and this is me 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.310
 quite satisfied with the mouse has a new 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 sensor avago 3310, unlike its 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.300
 fellow 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.090
 which was 3090 this sensor 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.840
 works in the infrared spectrum and 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.060
 provide distance from the fish in the area 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.430
 17 millimeters if desired distance from 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.630
 fish can be customized as well 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.840
 play that 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.790
 the survey was taken away the sensor does not have 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.280
 acceleration which is very positive 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.280
 affected by playing various shooters 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.700
 inside the mouse there are switches juan 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.519
 calculated on 10 million clicks 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.799
 and an optical encoder skrolla 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.470
 let's summarize from 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.890
 positive what I liked about it 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.100
 the mouse does not play does not creak and does not hang out 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.740
 second sensor avago 3310 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.320
 is the most top sensor on 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.729
 given time he steadily keeps on 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.760
 all modes dipiay 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.400
 and has accelerated the third 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.560
 what they liked was plug-n-play 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.200
 there is no need to install any drivers 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.950
 the mouse just connected nastrela dipiay 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.500
 button and hidi plays 4 cover 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.870
 supple and flexible with something like 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.120
 I have old Soviet headphones 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.180
 positive qualities can be listed 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.450
 but let's get to what I donâ€™t 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.270
 liked enough brand and cover 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.700
 if your hands are dirty or greasy then 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.430
 goals remain and in no case 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.160
 Think where these alcohol is second to what 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.099
 I did not like this tight click 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.890
 the scroll is very hard pressed as well 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.810
 poorly pronounced side buttons in 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.750
 intense game is very easy them 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.349
 confuse third clicks too loud 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.970
 how to scroll such main buttons if 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.729
 you play at night then by all means 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.490
 wake somebody up during the game 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:31.150
 you may be tired of the little finger which you 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.340
 hold the mouse but it is against it 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.440
 probably all ash company 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.320
 really tried on the mouse data 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.720
 and made her almost perfect mouse 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.690
 combines excellent ergonomics and 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.419
 top stuffing it all adds up 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.760
 excellent results in games many 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.610
 they say that the level of the game does not depend on 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.030
 devices guys trust me with this 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.190
 mouse you will just live if you 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.280
 I do not know what kind of mouse I take you 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.099
 I advise this model zovy efco 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.620
 huang but don't forget that the mouse is needed 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:09.370
 choose by the way it lies in the hand 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.010
 they are from what the external review was 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.510
