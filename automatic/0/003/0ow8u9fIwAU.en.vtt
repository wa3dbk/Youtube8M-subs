basically this is a simple method for

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
basically this is a simple method for
members<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:53.039> use<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:54.449> will

members only but you can use on you will

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
members only but you can use on you will
not<00:00:54.870> always<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.010> depends<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
not always because it depends on the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.189 
not always because it depends on the
weapon<00:00:57.449> poison<00:00:58.550> price<00:00:59.550> don't<00:01:00.539> explain<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
later first you know that as you do 3.2

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000 
later first you know that as you do 3.2
km<00:01:12.840> market<00:01:13.200> price<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> buy<00:01:13.979> a

I think is possible to actually you just
method<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.519> I'll<00:02:16.760> explain<00:02:17.329> why<00:02:17.450> later<00:02:19.450> so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
method and I'll explain why later so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.849 
method and I'll explain why later so
