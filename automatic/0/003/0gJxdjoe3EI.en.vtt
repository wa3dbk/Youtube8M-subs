00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.690
 you have been asking for a long time the remake 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.970
 of final fantasy 7 and they do not give it to us 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.150
 square enix has it saved under the 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.549
 manga but look at what a 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.379
 user because this is to give you a 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.930
 applause not this is to put a 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.910
 monument is the project to adapt the 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.070
 classic final fantasy 7 a 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.640
 littlebigplanet has taken more time 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.950
 of the expected eye but its creator finishes 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.170
 to finish his work here we have it 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.020
 managed to get the whole story and 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.560
 Optional missions in 31 levels has 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.200
 commented jamie oliver is the creator of 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.630
 what we're seeing says I think it's 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.600
 the first complete game made of 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.060
 beginning to end in littlebigplanet 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.160
 an authentic jewel an authentic work 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.840
 teacher has a combat system with 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.820
 the limits all the sequences and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.940
 dialogues the five types of material 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.460
 using the dinator creates the whole band 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.980
 sound every enemy boss character and a 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.230
 mapa mundi says he has worked a lot 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.479
 in this game and that has brought him nothing 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.800
 more and nothing less than two years this is 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.050
 an authentic work more 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.350
 and it seems to me that this guy honestly 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.480
 they would have to pay since they are and because I 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.040
 I think that only having done this for 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.290
 that the rest of users can 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.620
 enjoy it I think this deserves 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.070
 that this man is given something, that is, 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.400
 hire him please good less bad 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.630
 that by his luck the game can be 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.090
 enjoy not only in 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.130
 littlebigplanet 2 from playstation3 but 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.840
 that is also going to be enjoyed in 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.360
 the new littlebigplanet 3 of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 playstation 4 and playstation3 and I that 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.980
 you want me to tell you guys and only 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.330
 that's why I think it deserves the purchase at 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.610
 less than that third installment of 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.910
 littlebigplanet that is coming 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.620
 113 videos about this project are in 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.450
 the channel of the creator that by the way 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.700
 I leave it in the description because I believe 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.380
 it's worth it that you see it deserves 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.140
 the pity that we put this creator 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.890
 an authentic monument because small 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.890
 work has done
