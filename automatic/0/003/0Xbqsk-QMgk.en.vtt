00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.290
 Dr 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.820
 Hello this year I want to show you how to run Windows 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.500
 XP hype tables the so-called Group Policy Editor retrofit 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 can 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 The Group Policy Editor is a pretty powerful sot man devil, unfortunately 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.540
 not in this Variety Dr Rumi tables from XP but you can 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.930
 easily retrofit and indeed get us for it first 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.910
 The corresponding Salzburg because with the service Beck is quite 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.940
 included 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.610
 just not completely fixed with installed that is if they are 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.090
 Windows XP Home and they have respect two installed so far 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.460
 then they get exactly in this version 2 of the service pack again 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.470
 from Microsoft 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.900
 if they are, of course 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.710
 Sonsbecks 3 have installed 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.860
 then they have to show the same thing now with service pack three 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.239
 to do is logical 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.729
 so that they do not have different parts of you without him 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.990
 after saving the service pack on our hard drive Baumann 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.410
 as a second file to start our standard in the browser 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.990
 and since we are in this to http 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.420
 but in terms of society www point 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.770
 in the USA Corp. for the interests of the city is worthwhile itself 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.010
 create below 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.020

 Dash down MSC 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.560
 lid on it 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 Spain from the whole 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.359
 kri the war again is relatively small 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.140
 you can end the browser 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.140
 and start our Explorer 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.769
 optimally we have 7-zip installed another program which yes 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.120
 He himself had already presented himself 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.369
 because with 7-zip can this 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.180
 packing his respect very easily, of course, there are also with that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.299
 Microsoft's own expense command 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.860
 to expand 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.150
 However, that implies a bit easier that means we get it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.879
 easy 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.889
 via the Explorer right mouse button in the context menu 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.509
 since we have 7-zip, however, just need it directly 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 Extract here 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.839
 you click on it 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.109
 so many things were unpacked we have unpacked Natalie your own 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.839
 Directory the 3 86 are 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:03.249
 and 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.150
 further 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.749
 have yet to get a second directories 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.939
 "We now have some files parked in front of this house directory 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.279
 Copy out because we need them later 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.809
 and for that we need all that should directory 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.550
 i just take the directory the temp 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.550
 that means I want some files in the next step 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.719
 December 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.300
 2 just copy the three sixes 80 and so on 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 and a little better 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.650
 such a time is visible I do the whole thing from the command line if they 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.739
 Of course, you can see the corresponding names in this video 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.749
 Just note it and then expand it individually with the Explorer 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.549
 Directories here from fish 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.549
 so very gusty 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.279
 command line 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.949

 the 6 8 6 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.299
 How should the first words we need be called Managements 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.650
 So just Kombi 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.920
 mg and then just loved the car completion 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.520
 to process 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.330
 m Krieger the corresponding file already delivered directly ready 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.000
 and that just at the end only 1 d 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.559
 colon 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.559
 path/ 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.539
 the first of the three schools 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.740
 next we want to file the manager off then we will be best with 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.650
 a case up the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.880
 get the first line out again and just leave 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.270

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.469
 the 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.050
 such as 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.990
 feral is there are new ones 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.599

 WS GC Credit 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.930
 the stress and the 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.349
 so that was almost half the battle is moving change and thus explorer 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.879
 and there we jump our picture m directory to all the directory where 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:42.159
 we now have all the files in the booklet 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.159
 should be here now 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.740
 so they are all marked 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.869
 it simply announces this while holding down 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:57.229
 controlling that thereby all are marked and as all marked 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.539
 just follow right-click on any party again to choose 7-zip 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.589
 in the context menu and also like the extract 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.659
 Select here 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:11.129
 namely, these files are now unpacked now were the lyrical 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:12.199
 very nice 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.020
 Now it's the right dll files with the corresponding icon and not 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.099
 recognized 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:20.239
 let's call it the house parked the tournament 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.009
 Flame 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.490
 but problem wants again BZ and what you do me the whole files again 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.630
 Bern over 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.330
 right-click the context menu on «copy» 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.319
 and now 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:45.469
 Sec windows 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:48.469
 System should be on 30 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.629
 so many times will right mouse button and insert the corresponding files again 

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.969
 should participate again
