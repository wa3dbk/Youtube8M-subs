00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
didn't put as many pages as she did and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.600 
didn't put as many pages as she did and
I<00:01:46.200> used<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> hidden<00:01:46.740> hinge<00:01:46.920> system<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:47.460> I'll

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I used a hidden hinge system which I'll

show<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.630> made<00:01:48.899> my<00:01:49.079> own<00:01:49.110> little

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
show you but I made my own little

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.960 
show you but I made my own little
template<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:52.759> being<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.850> i

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
template which is this and being that i

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.520 
template which is this and being that i
made<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> hidden<00:01:54.600> hinge<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.170> why<00:01:55.380> it's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
made the hidden hinge that's why it's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
made the hidden hinge that's why it's
open<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:55.920> each<00:01:56.070> side<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.570> side

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
open on each side and then the one side

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.319 
open on each side and then the one side
gets<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.469> hinge<00:01:58.680> goes<00:01:58.920> inside<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.299> i

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
gets the hinge goes inside of it but i

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.539 
gets the hinge goes inside of it but i
made<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.659> own<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.990> template<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
