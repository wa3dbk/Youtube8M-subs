00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
really really good use you give it a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
little bit of throttle it just winds

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.440 
little bit of throttle it just winds

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
still pretty light and manageable but

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.340 
still pretty light and manageable but
it's<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.910> right<00:03:26.270> side<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.870> heavy<00:03:27.080> to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
power that a few years ago would be

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.710 
power that a few years ago would be
common<00:03:42.739> in<00:03:42.860> an<00:03:42.950> m3<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.790> also<00:03:44.209> love<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> fact

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
common in an m3 I also love the fact

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.050 
common in an m3 I also love the fact
that<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.020> so<00:03:45.350> stealthy<00:03:45.770> if<00:03:46.190> someone<00:03:46.730> saw<00:03:46.910> on

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
that it is so stealthy if someone saw on

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.910 
that it is so stealthy if someone saw on
the<00:03:47.150> street<00:03:47.390> they'd<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:47.780> oh<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.320> no

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
the street they'd be like oh it's no

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.390 
the street they'd be like oh it's no
three

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
three

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.270 
three
yeah<00:03:50.180> that's<00:03:50.750> quite<00:03:50.930> good<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.350> then<00:03:52.070> at<00:03:52.190> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
yeah that's quite good and then at the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280 
yeah that's quite good and then at the
light<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.760> sit<00:03:53.000> next<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.420> them<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.959> then<00:03:54.080> you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
light you sit next to them and then you

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.160 
light you sit next to them and then you
run<00:03:54.730> where<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.790> press<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.030> noise<00:03:56.270> pedal<00:03:56.750> and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
run where you press the noise pedal and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:07.030 
run where you press the noise pedal and
then<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.440> world<00:03:57.620> goes<00:03:57.770> backwards

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.589 

there<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.790> one<00:04:07.969> small<00:04:08.269> bone<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.569> contention

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
there is one small bone of contention

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.420 
there is one small bone of contention
with<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.319> and<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.700> price<00:04:11.180> base<00:04:11.750> it's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
with it and that is the price base it's

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.670 
with it and that is the price base it's
30,000<00:04:13.430> pounds<00:04:13.909> with<00:04:14.569> all<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:14.780> toys<00:04:15.049> we<00:04:15.349> have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
30,000 pounds with all the toys we have

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.240 
30,000 pounds with all the toys we have
it's<00:04:16.190> closer<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.959> 36<00:04:17.959> which<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.500> quite<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.949> lot

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
it's closer to 36 which is quite a lot

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.520 
it's closer to 36 which is quite a lot
of<00:04:19.430> money<00:04:19.669> but<00:04:19.910> then<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.239> remember<00:04:20.530> that

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
of money but then you remember that

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.450 
of money but then you remember that
actually<00:04:22.009> it's<00:04:22.340> cheaper<00:04:23.300> than<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.509> Boxster<00:04:23.960> and
