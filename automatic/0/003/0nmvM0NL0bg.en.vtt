in<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.000> build<00:00:12.240> at<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:13.070> now<00:00:14.070> i<00:00:14.309> don't

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
in this build at all now i don't

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.340 
in this build at all now i don't
recommend<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.240> build<00:00:15.509> since<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
recommend this build since the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650 
recommend this build since the
performance<00:00:16.980> /<00:00:17.190> price<00:00:17.490> ratio<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.180> pretty<00:00:18.480> low

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
performance / price ratio is pretty low

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.529 
performance / price ratio is pretty low
too<00:00:18.960> due<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> high<00:00:20.430> cost<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.939> some<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
too due to the high cost of some of the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
too due to the high cost of some of the
fanless<00:00:21.960> components<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.609> temperatures

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
fanless components and the temperatures

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.870 
fanless components and the temperatures
are<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.810> suck<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:26.490> want<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
are just going to suck if you want a

really<00:00:27.150> solid<00:00:27.539> pc<00:00:28.019> i<00:00:28.289> recommend<00:00:29.160> buying<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.580> few

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
really solid pc i recommend buying a few

difference in the temperatures there are

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
difference in the temperatures there are
a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> fans<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> market<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.989> are

a lot of fans on the market that are
extremely<00:00:37.829> sad<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.600> insist

to go with the phenom 2 x4 processor

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430 
to go with the phenom 2 x4 processor
which<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.420> been<00:00:57.510> perfect<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.199> this

which would have been perfect for this

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.490 
which would have been perfect for this
bill<00:00:59.149> however<00:01:00.149> consumed<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.260> two

bill however consumed more than two

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
bill however consumed more than two
times<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.949> power<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.730> processor<00:01:03.239> and

times the power of this processor and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
times the power of this processor and
it's<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.530> than<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> fanless<00:01:05.549> heatsink<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's more than the fanless heatsink can

however<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.620> wanted<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.099> make<00:02:14.250> sure<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.880> this

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
however I wanted to make sure and this

however I wanted to make sure and this
will<00:02:15.120> fit<00:02:15.390> especially<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> huge<00:02:17.069> cpu

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
will fit especially it is the huge cpu

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.690 
will fit especially it is the huge cpu

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
gigabytes which might be not enough for

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.570 
gigabytes which might be not enough for
most<00:03:12.120> people<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:13.349> me<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.590> will<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.860> fine<00:03:14.069> since

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
most people for me it will be fine since

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.990 
most people for me it will be fine since
i'm<00:03:14.760> currently<00:03:15.060> using<00:03:15.269> hundred<00:03:16.140> 80<00:03:16.319> gigabytes

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
i'm currently using hundred 80 gigabytes

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.729 
i'm currently using hundred 80 gigabytes
however<00:03:18.000> getting<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.600> bigger<00:03:18.840> city<00:03:19.109> will<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.709> a

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
however getting a bigger city will be a

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.400 
however getting a bigger city will be a
good<00:03:19.980> upgrade<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.209> course<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.380> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
good upgrade and of course this is a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.949 
good upgrade and of course this is a
very<00:03:22.620> fast<00:03:23.010> SSD<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.030> performance<00:03:24.720> will<00:03:24.810> be

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
very fast SSD so the performance will be

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.190 
very fast SSD so the performance will be
great<00:03:26.239> let's<00:03:27.239> look<00:03:27.390> at<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> next<00:03:27.780> component

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
great let's look at the next component

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.280 
great let's look at the next component
the<00:03:28.799> power<00:03:29.100> supply<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> part<00:03:31.049> where

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
the power supply this is the part where

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.860 
the power supply this is the part where
people<00:03:31.650> might<00:03:31.769> get<00:03:31.980> confused<00:03:32.420> while<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.630> gold

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
people might get confused while the gold

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.220 
people might get confused while the gold
is<00:03:34.310> $135<00:03:35.310> power<00:03:35.609> supply<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:35.970> would<00:03:36.180> ask<00:03:36.329> well

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
is $135 power supply you would ask well

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.440 
is $135 power supply you would ask well
that's<00:03:37.890> because<00:03:38.190> fanless<00:03:38.790> power<00:03:39.000> supplies

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
that's because fanless power supplies

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.500 
that's because fanless power supplies
are<00:03:39.660> friggin<00:03:40.019> expensive<00:03:40.400> not<00:03:41.400> really<00:03:41.760> look<00:03:42.389> at

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
are friggin expensive not really look at

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.309 
are friggin expensive not really look at
