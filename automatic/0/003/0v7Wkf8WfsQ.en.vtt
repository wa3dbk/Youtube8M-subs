00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.960 
phone from LG and it is codename optimus
big<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.899> seems<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.410> come<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.670> same

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
big and it seems to come with the same

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.320 
big and it seems to come with the same
technology<00:00:09.570> as<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.050> lg<00:00:10.530> optimus<00:00:10.769> black<00:00:11.700> came

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
technology as this lg optimus black came

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.289 
technology as this lg optimus black came
with<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.960> Nova<00:00:13.889> technology<00:00:14.519> which<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
with this Nova technology which is

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.830 
with this Nova technology which is
basically<00:00:15.839> display<00:00:16.410> technology<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:18.539> get

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
basically display technology so you get

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.740 
basically display technology so you get
pretty<00:00:19.199> good<00:00:19.289> display<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.550> these<00:00:21.210> two<00:00:21.480> phones

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
pretty good display on these two phones

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.070 
pretty good display on these two phones
so<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:24.060> difference<00:00:24.359> between<00:00:24.689> these<00:00:24.840> two

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
so this the difference between these two

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
so this the difference between these two
phones<00:00:25.320> first<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> lg<00:00:26.490> optimus<00:00:26.519> black

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
it was in a orange form I think and this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.190 
it was in a orange form I think and this
one<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.890> big<00:00:32.669> lg<00:00:33.239> optimus<00:00:33.270> big<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.079> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
with this newer technology and it seems

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
with this newer technology and it seems
like<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> best

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
like that one was the best

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.170 
like that one was the best
know<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> technology<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.729> win<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
know a technology you know for win it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.170 
know a technology you know for win it
seems<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:23.250> thing<00:01:23.580> there

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and hopefully this phone will probably

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.390 
and hopefully this phone will probably
launch<00:01:29.880> outside<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.750> Korea<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.310> know

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
launch outside of Korea but you know

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
launch outside of Korea but you know
it's<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> those<00:01:33.210> badass<00:01:33.659> phone<00:01:33.900> use

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's not one of those badass phone use

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.520 
it's not one of those badass phone use
one<00:01:35.040> years<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.670> Singapore<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.110> nice<00:01:37.290> to
