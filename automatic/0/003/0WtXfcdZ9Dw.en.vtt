with<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.650> nice<00:01:04.979> narrow<00:01:05.460> road<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.450> can't<00:01:06.720> really

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
with a nice narrow road you can't really

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.749 
with a nice narrow road you can't really
see<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.259> there's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.619> small<00:01:07.920> orange<00:01:08.310> circle

at the tip of my mouse arrow and this is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149 
at the tip of my mouse arrow and this is
basically<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.210> Road<00:01:12.630> point<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> click<00:01:14.040> the

then<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.429> choose<00:01:17.670> anywhere<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.569> I<00:01:18.600> want

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
then I can choose anywhere that I want

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.239 
then I can choose anywhere that I want
to<00:01:18.899> drop<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.259> second<00:01:19.619> point<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> there's

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
to drop the second point and there's

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:21.709 
to drop the second point and there's
going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.609> line<00:01:20.880> between<00:01:21.119> those<00:01:21.479> two

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
going to be a line between those two

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.709 
going to be a line between those two
points<00:01:21.749> and<00:01:22.549> along<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.579> line<00:01:23.999> is<00:01:24.359> where<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
points and along that line is where the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.450 
points and along that line is where the
road<00:01:24.899> is<00:01:25.079> placed<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.649> something<00:01:26.249> cool<00:01:26.429> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
road is placed and something cool that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.279 
road is placed and something cool that
you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.359> can<00:01:27.390> drag<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> mouse

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
you can do is you can drag the mouse

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.709 
you can do is you can drag the mouse
along<00:01:29.069> your<00:01:29.310> path<00:01:29.520> between<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.149> two<00:01:30.329> points

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
along your path between your two points

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.270 
along your path between your two points
and<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.170> curb<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.499> they<00:01:31.679> just<00:01:32.069> don't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and you can curb your they just don't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.029 
and you can curb your they just don't
take<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> too<00:01:32.700> far<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.149> will<00:01:33.299> break<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.780> line

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
take it too far it will break the line

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.099 
take it too far it will break the line
but<00:01:35.039> if<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:35.429> just<00:01:35.819> a<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.149> bit<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
but if you got just a little bit as you

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.719 
but if you got just a little bit as you
see<00:01:37.289> here<00:01:37.469> I<00:01:37.499> get<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.950> curve<00:01:38.219> action

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
see here I get a little curve action

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
see here I get a little curve action
going<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.649> of<00:01:40.679> make<00:01:40.859> my<00:01:41.009> Road<00:01:41.249> look

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
going and just kind of make my Road look

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.410 
going and just kind of make my Road look
a<00:01:41.639> little<00:01:41.789> bit<00:01:41.999> more<00:01:42.179> natural<00:01:42.359> on<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.499> fly<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
a little bit more natural on the fly and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.849 
a little bit more natural on the fly and
the<00:01:45.420> only<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:46.139> thing<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.590> need<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
the only other thing that you need to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.499 
the only other thing that you need to
know<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:46.979> roads<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.999> you<00:01:48.149> hold<00:01:48.450> down

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
know about roads is if you hold down

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.590 
know about roads is if you hold down
control<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.520> break<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.969> road<00:01:51.240> action

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
control you can break the road action

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
control you can break the road action
and<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.020> actually<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:53.219> picks<00:01:53.639> that<00:01:53.819> point

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and this actually just picks that point

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
and this actually just picks that point
up<00:01:54.329> off<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.810> map<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.439> let<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.829> move<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
up off the map and let you move to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.980 
up off the map and let you move to
another<00:01:56.340> spot<00:01:56.609> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
another spot so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.410 
another spot so
say<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.700> road<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
say I want to make road up here in the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.710 
say I want to make road up here in the
corner<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.799> let<00:02:01.979> go<00:02:02.159> control<00:02:02.579> click<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
corner I just let go control click the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.219 
corner I just let go control click the
mouse<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.930> drop<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.500> first<00:02:04.770> point<00:02:06.049> set<00:02:07.049> my

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
mouse to drop my first point set my

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
mouse to drop my first point set my
second<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> I've<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.459> road<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> new

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
second point and I've got road and a new

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.900 
second point and I've got road and a new
spot<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> road<00:02:11.400> brush<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
spot so that's it for the road brush and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.330 
spot so that's it for the road brush and
we're<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.209> move<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.720> height<00:02:13.340> tool

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
we're going to move to the height tool

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.610 
we're going to move to the height tool
next<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.150> stick<00:02:15.720> around<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.470> I'll

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
next so stick around for that and I'll

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.259 
next so stick around for that and I'll
see<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.920> soon<00:02:19.550> alright<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> moving<00:02:21.150> right

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
see you soon alright a moving right

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.690 
see you soon alright a moving right
along<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> height<00:02:22.290> brush<00:02:22.680> you'll<00:02:23.430> see

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
along to the height brush you'll see

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
along to the height brush you'll see
that<00:02:23.880> we've<00:02:24.150> got<00:02:24.420> many<00:02:24.750> operations<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.890> we

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that we've got many operations that we

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.949 
that we've got many operations that we
can<00:02:26.400> use<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> height<00:02:27.090> brush<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.720> will

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
can use with the height brush you will

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.199 
can use with the height brush you will
be<00:02:28.110> using<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.500> higher<00:02:28.650> brush<00:02:28.920> quite<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> bit<00:02:29.489> that

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
be using a higher brush quite a bit that

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.509 
be using a higher brush quite a bit that
in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> cliff<00:02:31.470> editor<00:02:31.830> are<00:02:31.980> probably<00:02:32.250> too

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
in the cliff editor are probably too

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.650 
in the cliff editor are probably too
that<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:32.970> use<00:02:33.739> almost<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.980> most

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
that you will use almost the most

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.580 
that you will use almost the most
depending<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.660> what<00:02:36.810> you're<00:02:36.989> doing<00:02:37.019> but

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
depending on what you're doing but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.949 
depending on what you're doing but
anyway<00:02:38.310> jumping<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.120> our<00:02:39.660> first

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
anyway jumping right in our first

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.830 
anyway jumping right in our first
operation<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> height<00:02:41.010> tool<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
operation with the height tool is the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.949 
operation with the height tool is the
Rays<00:02:43.430> action<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.730> basically<00:02:45.299> this<00:02:45.569> just

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
Rays action and basically this just

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.870 
Rays action and basically this just
raises<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> terrain<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.340> let<00:02:47.610> me<00:02:47.700> go<00:02:47.850> ahead

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
raises the terrain so let me go ahead

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.759 
raises the terrain so let me go ahead
and<00:02:48.209> get<00:02:49.200> zoomed<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.400> see<00:02:50.640> this

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
and get zoomed in so you can see this

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.280 
and get zoomed in so you can see this
but<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:53.030> pretty<00:02:54.030> self-explanatory<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:55.080> more<00:02:55.260> i

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
but a pretty self-explanatory the more i

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.850 
but a pretty self-explanatory the more i
push<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.739> mouse<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.250> more<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.970> raises<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
push the mouse the more it raises the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.300 
push the mouse the more it raises the
terrain<00:02:58.860> up<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.450> your<00:03:01.170> next<00:03:01.620> option<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:02.010> lower

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
terrain up and your next option is lower

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.400 
terrain up and your next option is lower
and<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.880> has<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.329> opposite<00:03:03.780> effect<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.260> can

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and it has the opposite effect you can

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.830 
and it has the opposite effect you can
either<00:03:04.500> use<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.209> lower<00:03:06.209> something<00:03:06.690> that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
either use it to lower something that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
either use it to lower something that
you've<00:03:07.049> raised<00:03:07.350> or<00:03:07.859> as<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.820> see<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.239> can

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
you've raised or as you can see you can

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.000 
you've raised or as you can see you can
also<00:03:09.600> create<00:03:10.670> craters

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.429 

ditches<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.040> things<00:03:15.579> of<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.730> nature<00:03:15.879> is

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
ditches and things of that nature is

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.860 
ditches and things of that nature is
basically<00:03:17.439> lowering<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.980> terrain<00:03:18.280> even<00:03:18.549> more

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
basically lowering the terrain even more

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.850 
basically lowering the terrain even more
so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.000 

see<00:03:24.520> if<00:03:24.580> we<00:03:24.700> can<00:03:24.880> sculpt<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.600> little<00:03:26.010> jelly

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
see if we can sculpt that little jelly

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.870 
see if we can sculpt that little jelly
here<00:03:27.990> all<00:03:28.990> right<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.320> your<00:03:30.160> next<00:03:30.520> option<00:03:30.700> is

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
here all right and your next option is

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.640 
here all right and your next option is
going<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.180> be<00:03:31.300> your<00:03:31.480> uniform<00:03:32.080> this<00:03:32.320> is<00:03:32.470> just

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
going to be your uniform this is just

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.300 
going to be your uniform this is just
going<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:32.860> attempt<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:35.590> make<00:03:35.770> your<00:03:35.920> train

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
going to attempt to to make your train

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.670 
going to attempt to to make your train
uniform<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.570> has<00:03:37.630> no<00:03:37.840> randomization<00:03:38.230> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
uniform so it has no randomization and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.130 
uniform so it has no randomization and
try<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:38.980> kind<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.280> make<00:03:39.460> it<00:03:39.490> match<00:03:39.790> up<00:03:40.090> as<00:03:40.300> you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
try to kind of make it match up as you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.620 
try to kind of make it match up as you
can<00:03:41.290> see<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:43.570> much<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:44.050> with<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.410> texture

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
can see it's much like with that texture

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.850 
can see it's much like with that texture
uniform<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:47.800> make

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
uniform it's just going to make

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.230 
uniform it's just going to make
everything<00:03:49.170> even<00:03:50.170> basically<00:03:51.040> as<00:03:51.670> even<00:03:52.150> as

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
everything even basically as even as

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.670 
everything even basically as even as
possible<00:03:52.690> depending<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:53.050> where<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.260> click<00:03:53.470> at

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
possible depending on where you click at

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.910 
possible depending on where you click at
but<00:03:53.950> as<00:03:54.100> you<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.450> let<00:03:56.200> me<00:03:56.290> try<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.800> on

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
but as you can see let me try and get on

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.180 
but as you can see let me try and get on
a<00:03:57.030> better<00:03:58.030> spot<00:03:58.450> here

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
a better spot here

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.890 
a better spot here
the<00:04:00.730> section<00:04:01.150> right<00:04:01.300> here<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.750> all<00:04:02.110> sorts<00:04:02.800> of

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
the section right here is all sorts of

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.860 
the section right here is all sorts of
uneven<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.170> if<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.130> Center<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.030> uniform<00:04:07.540> in

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
uneven and if I Center the uniform in

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.270 
uneven and if I Center the uniform in
there<00:04:08.710> it's<00:04:09.370> attempting<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.240> give<00:04:10.660> me<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> nice

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
there it's attempting to give me a nice

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.949 
there it's attempting to give me a nice
even<00:04:12.280> plateau<00:04:13.740> so<00:04:14.940> that's<00:04:15.940> uniform<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.840> you

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
even plateau so that's uniform for you

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.470 
even plateau so that's uniform for you
and<00:04:17.200> then<00:04:17.980> you've<00:04:18.100> got<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.430> noise<00:04:18.610> this<00:04:19.420> is

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
and then you've got the noise this is

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.720 
and then you've got the noise this is
basically<00:04:20.380> just<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.010> give<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.340> like<00:04:21.700> a

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
basically just going to give you like a

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.990 
basically just going to give you like a
randomized<00:04:23.190> item<00:04:24.190> type<00:04:24.790> then<00:04:25.060> going<00:04:25.390> on<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:27.000> as

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
randomized item type then going on so as

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.660 
randomized item type then going on so as
you<00:04:28.150> can<00:04:28.270> see<00:04:28.540> here<00:04:28.860> it's<00:04:29.860> kind<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.160> raising

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
you can see here it's kind of raising

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.630 
you can see here it's kind of raising
and<00:04:30.910> lowering<00:04:31.680> both<00:04:32.680> at<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:32.980> same<00:04:33.160> time<00:04:33.190> so

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
and lowering both at the same time so

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.800 
and lowering both at the same time so
it's<00:04:33.790> kind<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.090> mix<00:04:34.420> of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.960> two<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:36.750> see<00:04:37.750> if

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
it's kind of a mix of the two and see if

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.920 
it's kind of a mix of the two and see if
you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.050> see<00:04:38.290> that

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.050 

I<00:04:43.990> think<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.949> little<00:04:45.070> bit<00:04:45.400> easier<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.820> see

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
I think it's a little bit easier to see

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.950 
I think it's a little bit easier to see
zoomed<00:04:47.050> out<00:04:48.000> beatin's<00:04:49.000> giving<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.419> kind<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.870> a

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
zoomed out beatin's giving you kind of a

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.290 
zoomed out beatin's giving you kind of a
almost<00:04:50.410> like<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.650> naturalistic<00:04:51.220> type<00:04:51.729> type

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
almost like a naturalistic type type

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.700 
almost like a naturalistic type type
look<00:04:52.539> and<00:04:52.810> then<00:04:52.900> you've<00:04:53.050> got<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.380> smooth

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
look and then you've got the smooth

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.240 
look and then you've got the smooth
button<00:04:54.100> in<00:04:54.160> which<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.930> used<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.139> lot<00:04:56.470> back<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
button in which I used a lot back in the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.210 
button in which I used a lot back in the
warcraft<00:04:57.910> 3<00:04:58.210> days<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.620> probably<00:04:59.860> want<00:05:00.160> to

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
warcraft 3 days and you probably want to

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.689 
warcraft 3 days and you probably want to
it's<00:05:00.639> just<00:05:00.759> a<00:05:01.030> way<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:02.130> smooth<00:05:03.130> out<00:05:03.340> your<00:05:03.400> rough

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
it's just a way to smooth out your rough

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.950 
it's just a way to smooth out your rough
edges<00:05:05.490> as<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.669> see<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:06.970> attempts<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.449> make

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
edges as you see it attempts to make

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.279 
edges as you see it attempts to make
everything<00:05:08.639> look<00:05:09.639> real<00:05:10.030> soft<00:05:10.479> and<00:05:10.870> non

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
everything look real soft and non

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.270 
everything look real soft and non
angular<00:05:11.919> which<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.669> important<00:05:13.180> for<00:05:14.280> natural

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
angular which is important for natural

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.580 
angular which is important for natural
landscapes<00:05:15.759> or<00:05:15.940> pretty<00:05:16.240> much<00:05:16.300> any<00:05:16.539> landscape

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
landscapes or pretty much any landscape

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.890 
landscapes or pretty much any landscape
as<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.340> can<00:05:18.490> see<00:05:18.760> here<00:05:18.970> most<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.330> my<00:05:19.450> jagged

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
as you can see here most of my jagged

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.210 
as you can see here most of my jagged
edges<00:05:20.050> are<00:05:20.440> just<00:05:21.340> spilling<00:05:21.940> out<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:23.220> that's

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
edges are just spilling out so that's

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.870 
edges are just spilling out so that's
pretty<00:05:24.610> much<00:05:24.670> the<00:05:24.790> hype<00:05:25.030> tool<00:05:26.520> there<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.640> one

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
pretty much the hype tool there is one

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.400 
pretty much the hype tool there is one
setting<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.360> you'll<00:05:28.570> want<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.870> look<00:05:28.990> at<00:05:29.230> and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
setting that you'll want to look at and

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.880 
setting that you'll want to look at and
that's<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.860> amplitude<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.850> that's<00:05:31.890> just

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
that's the amplitude and that's just

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.790 
that's the amplitude and that's just
like<00:05:33.390> kind<00:05:34.390> of<00:05:34.420> like<00:05:34.480> increments<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:35.440> some<00:05:35.710> of

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
like kind of like increments and some of

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.410 
like kind of like increments and some of
the<00:05:35.860> other<00:05:35.980> brushes<00:05:36.310> it's<00:05:36.940> basically<00:05:37.300> just

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
the other brushes it's basically just

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.870 
the other brushes it's basically just
the<00:05:39.000> amount<00:05:40.000> or<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.390> strength<00:05:40.900> of<00:05:41.470> your<00:05:41.880> raise

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
the amount or the strength of your raise

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.300 
the amount or the strength of your raise
or<00:05:43.180> lower<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:43.420> whichever<00:05:43.810> one<00:05:44.200> it<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:45.100> that

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
or lower and whichever one it is that

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.690 
or lower and whichever one it is that
you<00:05:45.400> happen<00:05:45.700> to<00:05:45.760> be<00:05:45.850> doing<00:05:46.120> at<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.330> time<00:05:47.700> so

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
you happen to be doing at the time so

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.980 
you happen to be doing at the time so
let's<00:05:48.880> go<00:05:49.060> ahead<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.270> it's<00:05:49.660> not<00:05:49.810> going<00:05:49.900> to

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
let's go ahead and it's not going to

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.660 
let's go ahead and it's not going to
work<00:05:50.050> on<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.350> smooth<00:05:50.620> but<00:05:50.980> let's<00:05:51.220> go<00:05:51.610> to

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
work on the smooth but let's go to

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.310 
work on the smooth but let's go to
height<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.840> we'll<00:05:53.410> do<00:05:53.530> amplitude<00:05:54.190> of<00:05:54.490> 50<00:05:55.320> I've

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
height and we'll do amplitude of 50 I've

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.670 
height and we'll do amplitude of 50 I've
got<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.500> nice<00:05:56.710> small<00:05:58.020> just<00:05:59.020> a<00:05:59.080> little<00:05:59.410> bit<00:05:59.530> of<00:05:59.620> a

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
got a nice small just a little bit of a

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.230 
got a nice small just a little bit of a
raised<00:05:59.890> there<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.490> if<00:06:00.550> we<00:06:00.610> jump<00:06:00.910> it<00:06:01.030> up<00:06:01.090> to

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
raised there and if we jump it up to

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.310 
raised there and if we jump it up to
four<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:02.710> see<00:06:02.920> we<00:06:03.070> almost<00:06:03.220> get<00:06:03.610> like<00:06:03.910> a<00:06:04.320> almost

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
four you see we almost get like a almost

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.010 
four you see we almost get like a almost
like<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.590> cliff<00:06:06.630> actually<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.660> think<00:06:07.810> that's<00:06:07.960> a

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
like a cliff actually I think that's a

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.690 
like a cliff actually I think that's a
little<00:06:08.110> bit<00:06:08.320> taller<00:06:08.350> than<00:06:08.800> a<00:06:08.890> standard<00:06:09.400> cliff

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
little bit taller than a standard cliff

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.630 
little bit taller than a standard cliff
but<00:06:10.260> yeah<00:06:11.260> you<00:06:11.320> can<00:06:11.470> you<00:06:12.070> definitely<00:06:12.460> see<00:06:12.610> a

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
but yeah you can you definitely see a

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.250 
but yeah you can you definitely see a
difference<00:06:12.700> there

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
difference there

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.440 
difference there
and<00:06:14.440> then<00:06:14.800> you<00:06:14.920> got<00:06:15.100> your<00:06:15.130> size<00:06:15.790> and<00:06:16.240> speed

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
and then you got your size and speed

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.090 
and then you got your size and speed
these<00:06:16.810> just<00:06:17.080> manipulate<00:06:17.560> the<00:06:17.710> brushes

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
these just manipulate the brushes

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.370 
these just manipulate the brushes
themselves<00:06:18.700> and<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.450> went<00:06:19.600> over<00:06:19.750> that<00:06:19.870> part<00:06:20.170> 1

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
themselves and I went over that part 1
