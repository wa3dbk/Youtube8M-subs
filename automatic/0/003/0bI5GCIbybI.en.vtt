 new episode of the fighting destiny 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.899
 given the success of the first video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.000
 in the library where I talked about 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.250
 ted kennedy sting I decided to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.730
 continue on this strand on this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 Street 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.780
 in fact today we will talk about the ankara 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 legendary creatures of which for now not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 we still know a lot but let's start from that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 that by now they should know everyone 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 or the three exotic pieces already in the game 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 the first is the thorn of the young ankara 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 how many exotic for footballer whose 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.599
 description bring me back my arm 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 bearer let me help you fill up 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.420
 the world intent to then move on to 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.800
 skull of the terrible ankara for warlock 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 the reality is the best form 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.230
 a bearer of mine you are not hungry up to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.750
 neo always arrived for a scream cartouche 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.670
 of ankara who report admires all 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.079
 this life or my carrier is like this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 much to burn 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.260
 keep this insistence in mind 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.579
 lawyers vain to refer to those who 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.379
 wields the object in question 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.180
 almost as if the creature were still 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.399
 alive and tempted us to commit 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.780
 mistakes will come in handy soon 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.100
 decided to investigate also the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.559
 provenance of this term 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 ankara is a Sanskrit word used 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.130
 even in philosophy and Hindu refer to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 one of the four parts of the soul 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.710
 in particular of our chile e 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.869
 precisely that of selfishness 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.250
 of the individual action once purely 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.409
 for personal purposes 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.460
 finally move to the library where 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.259
 the first card to take in 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.360
 consideration is spectrum fragment 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.799
 warlock who sees a witch who in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.509
 pocket a piece of vertebrae of one 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.159
 creature struggling with a hunter 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 which he is talking about this breed 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.150
 of dragons and jane dari that he said 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 only one sorcerer can kill there are 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 excerpts of indirect thought book 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 or a sort of interior monologue 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.540
 of the sorceress in which he tries to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.579
 exculpate oneself convince oneself of not having 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.320
 did nothing wrong as if the bone that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.320
 he was in his pocket talking to her but 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.870
 let's see what the card itself says 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.909
 try yesterday try to explain but none 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.310
 no one understands who is not a sorcerer 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.170
 a witch no one who has not passed 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.640
 dozen years sifting through the ruins 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.130
 search for a string of symbols a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 clean code a titans black claw 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.550
 they make great puffs if they are left 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.020
 wake up the soccer players clean up the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.180
 nails with knife and look at you like 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.590
 if you got a third eye but 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
 when your life has been rummaging through 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.490
 among archaic mysteries in search of a 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.190
 ancient power makes you try 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.800
 to educate others especially we are 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.780
 had a little too much 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 I had a broken vertebra in my pocket for 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.770
 example to the site from yes for example is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.910
 was the pre banned but what 3ds my 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.710
 consciousness 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.930
 it was a fossil there is a replacement of 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.340
 minerals practically a stone would be 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.130
 survived for a couple of hours mine 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.480
 Falasca please shut up 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.580
 the tar clips that they wouldn't have either 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.780
 having felt the lack, everyone knows that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.500
 the Ankaras were hunted up 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.010
 extinction 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.030
 there is nothing left to fear from the outside 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.750
 think how mysterious we are this 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.180
 system 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.310
 I said how much life appeared on arrival 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.200
 of the traveler for example iamm cara 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.110
 know the legends the dragon who 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 he made such fossilized promises 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.810
 with an epic gesture she pulled out the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.060
 knife started policy lost nails 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.990
 the stirrups you would never have been able to 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.690
 tear down 1 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.700
 I never said it wouldn't come out in the most 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.130
 absolute of the hunters in the strongest 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.510
 of titans she squints and eyes 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.920
 so he said to himself and saw in that 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.630
 moment that he would not have given up 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.170
 challenge I just murdered one 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.870
 Guardian I thought will die 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.370
 it will be all my fault and looking at the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.349
 piece of spine that I had in my hand 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.340
 I wondered why I did it 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.019
 what drove me from pride 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.550
 summarizing what we know so far ai 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.290
 ankara are a lineage of the now now 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.970
 hunt to extinction whose remains 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.739
 but they still seem to contain part 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.120
 of their personality or will that 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.769
 can therefore bring a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.390
 guardian as we have seen a 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.040
 commit inhuman acts 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.900
 also some sun warlocks are 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.310
 able to kill them but we move on to 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.170
 next card or fragment of 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.819
 spectrum legends 3 which narrates precisely 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.890
 of the great fighter he brought 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.440
 to the extinction of the aforementioned ankara la 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.150
 paper reads after careful reflections yes 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.040
 determined that it was necessary to extinguish the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.049
 ankara was not an easy decision 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.700
 thanks to the agreements they yield your power 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.010
 the city needed power 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.750
 information was slipped from 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.030
 ankara knowing the answer to questions that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.590
 no one even knew how to ask but the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.120
 price was too high no edict 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.220
 acquiescence seemed to stop the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.930
 guardians who went looking for them pushed 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 from hope to revenge, count 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.920
 despair and the call had to be 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.350
 silenced so the was put in place 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.300
 great hunt 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.130
 they ankara their call was extinct 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.709
 their solipsistic muted 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.530
 adulations eliminate their grand plans 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.450
 if they had ever existed destroyed e 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.940
 this then be sure I have mine 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.320
 reader from this card instead we understand 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.850
 that the city had agreements with 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.560
 this lineage of dragons they would have 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.080
 lost their power their knowledge 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.090
 unattainable for us in exchange for well 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.350
 it is not clear what a theory is 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.700
 who believes that car hubs had 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.200
 need solar energy that 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.790
 it would also explain why the titans are 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.440
 the only ones who don't have an exotic piece 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.300
 inherent to them since they are 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.890
 without solar energy 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.420
 in any case they were too dangerous 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.490
 of their knowledge their power there 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.930
 coveted by the guardians to such an extent as to 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.420
 having to force the consensus of the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.130
 city ​​order the most clever of extinction 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.020
 and careful they will have noticed at the end 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.120
 just the paper I have mine 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.770
 reader that just like in the three pieces 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.750
 exotic of primary which I spoke before 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.700
 it makes us guess that maybe it is talking 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.970
 just an ankara that probably not 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.560
 they are totally extinguished finally for 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.330
 arrive at the possible size form 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.230
 we don't have many friends with her 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.060
 information 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.370
 if not those we can extrapolate 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.470
 from the three nearby pieces we already have in 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.970
 game would say that they are not then 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.680
 so great to be the dragons and jane 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.810
 dari species by examining the text of 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.340
 terrible ankara while contrary to 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.110
 what we have just said almost to one 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.330
 mission awakening and is part of 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.560
 new from the darkness of the deep if 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.360
 those that we see our right 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.640
 of the final room were really le 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.380
 bones of an ankara the remains of an ankara 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.060
 it would be gigantic in size 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.100
 and I don't regret to say that that that 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.470
 it would be really thrilling thrilling 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.060
 face one what you think of 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.650
 this story guys think it is 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.690
 a waste of time or maybe not 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.760
 I will remain that pangea put us one 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.800
 race as a boss of late raids and maybe 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.330
 in the last dlc let me know in 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.460
 comments left I like to share
