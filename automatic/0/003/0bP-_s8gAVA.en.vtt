here<00:03:05.299> they<00:03:05.419> are<00:03:05.450> side-by-side<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.319> can

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
here they are side-by-side you can

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.659 
here they are side-by-side you can
certainly<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:06.889> that<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.159> iphone<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
certainly see that the iphone is a

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.420 
certainly see that the iphone is a
little<00:03:08.090> bit<00:03:08.209> bigger<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:09.799> put<00:03:09.919> on<00:03:10.010> top<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.310> each

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
little bit bigger to put on top of each

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.800 
little bit bigger to put on top of each
other<00:03:10.549> here<00:03:12.730> size-wise<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:14.329> can<00:03:14.569> see<00:03:14.689> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
other here size-wise you can see the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.729 
other here size-wise you can see the
storm<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.169> just<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.319> little<00:03:15.469> bit<00:03:15.650> thicker<00:03:15.889> and

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
storm is just a little bit thicker and

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.740 
storm is just a little bit thicker and
it's<00:03:18.739> also<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:19.010> little<00:03:19.310> bit<00:03:19.459> narrower<00:03:20.180> so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
it's also a little bit narrower so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.629 
it's also a little bit narrower so
relatively<00:03:21.049> close<00:03:21.409> in<00:03:21.620> size<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.099> certainly<00:03:22.549> a

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
relatively close in size and certainly a

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.899 
relatively close in size and certainly a
pocketable<00:03:23.120> device<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:25.549> phone<00:03:25.729> that

pocketable device the phone that

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.339 
pocketable device the phone that

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
probably most people and varieties will

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.550
