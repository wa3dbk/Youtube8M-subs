warfare 2 so uh today's November fifth I
got<00:00:19.550> that<00:00:19.700> black<00:00:19.910> ops<00:00:20.090> a<00:00:20.180> couple<00:00:20.390> days<00:00:20.510> early

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
got that black ops a couple days early

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
got that black ops a couple days early
server<00:00:21.260> just<00:00:21.470> came<00:00:21.650> online<00:00:21.800> today<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.680> the

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
server just came online today so the

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.080 
server just came online today so the
gameplay<00:00:25.010> is<00:00:25.070> not<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.370> best<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:25.730> my<00:00:25.850> first

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
gameplay is not the best it's my first

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.330 
gameplay is not the best it's my first
gameplay<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:27.380> reason<00:00:27.710> I'm<00:00:27.770> using<00:00:27.830> is<00:00:28.130> because

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
gameplay the reason I'm using is because

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.320 
gameplay the reason I'm using is because
I<00:00:28.430> don't<00:00:28.580> know<00:00:28.610> if<00:00:28.760> they're<00:00:28.880> going<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.060> when

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
I don't know if they're going to when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.760 
I don't know if they're going to when
they're<00:00:29.480> turning<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.810> servers<00:00:30.140> off<00:00:30.320> today<00:00:30.590> so

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
they're turning the servers off today so

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.740 
they're turning the servers off today so
I<00:00:31.070> figured<00:00:31.610> I'd<00:00:31.730> just<00:00:31.820> shoot<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.210> gameplay<00:00:32.570> up

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
I figured I'd just shoot the gameplay up

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.040 
I figured I'd just shoot the gameplay up
and<00:00:32.960> whatnot<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.149> in<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:35.300> future<00:00:35.420> my<00:00:35.719> gameplay

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
and whatnot so in the future my gameplay

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.270 
and whatnot so in the future my gameplay
will<00:00:36.230> be<00:00:36.379> a<00:00:36.409> little<00:00:36.559> bit<00:00:36.710> better<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:36.949> won't<00:00:37.159> die

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
will be a little bit better I won't die

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.849 
will be a little bit better I won't die
as<00:00:37.399> much<00:00:37.609> so<00:00:38.089> but<00:00:38.960> it's<00:00:39.140> not<00:00:39.289> all<00:00:39.440> about<00:00:39.499> kill

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
as much so but it's not all about kill

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.829 
as much so but it's not all about kill
death<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.159> my<00:00:40.249> opinion<00:00:40.460> anyway<00:00:40.670> because<00:00:41.600> my

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
death in my opinion anyway because my

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.119 
death in my opinion anyway because my
goal<00:00:41.989> is<00:00:42.079> to<00:00:42.170> entertain<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.649> educate<00:00:42.710> that's

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
goal is to entertain and educate that's

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.610 
goal is to entertain and educate that's
my<00:00:43.249> little<00:00:43.370> motto<00:00:43.609> so<00:00:44.539> sometimes<00:00:45.109> I<00:00:45.469> can

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
my little motto so sometimes I can

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.160 
my little motto so sometimes I can
entertain<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.309> educate<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.329> from<00:00:47.749> a

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
entertain and educate you from a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.229 
entertain and educate you from a
gameplay<00:00:48.679> where<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.010> go<00:00:49.159> 17<00:00:49.639> and<00:00:49.789> 11<00:00:50.089> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
gameplay where I go 17 and 11 and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.559 
gameplay where I go 17 and 11 and
hopefully<00:00:50.929> I<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.219> so<00:00:52.269> because<00:00:53.269> I<00:00:53.420> mean

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
hopefully I can so because I mean

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:56.169 
hopefully I can so because I mean
sometimes<00:00:53.929> when<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:54.319> I<00:00:54.909> don't<00:00:55.909> know<00:00:55.969> like

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
sometimes when you go I don't know like

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.029 
sometimes when you go I don't know like
30<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:56.960> two<00:00:57.139> there's<00:00:57.319> not<00:00:57.469> much<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.829> teach

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
30 and two there's not much to teach

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.369 
30 and two there's not much to teach
because<00:00:58.299> if<00:00:59.299> any<00:00:59.569> maybe<00:00:59.809> York<00:01:00.019> illustrates

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
because if any maybe York illustrates

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.020 
because if any maybe York illustrates
did<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.649> work<00:01:00.829> or<00:01:01.069> you<00:01:01.280> know<00:01:01.339> whatever<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:01.879> is

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
did the work or you know whatever it is

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.920 
did the work or you know whatever it is
so<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.289> is<00:01:03.440> just<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:04.269> first<00:01:05.269> gameplay<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:05.810> I

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
so this is just the first gameplay so I

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.030 
so this is just the first gameplay so I
hope<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.229> enjoyed<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.470> gameplay<00:01:06.710> just

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.440 
seen it I mean black ops was leaked
everywhere<00:01:10.159> but<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:11.030> haven't<00:01:11.210> seen<00:01:11.360> much

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
everywhere but you haven't seen much

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.899 
everywhere but you haven't seen much
black<00:01:11.719> ops<00:01:11.930> footage<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.619> right<00:01:13.549> here<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.759> just

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
black ops footage and right here I just

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.190 
black ops footage and right here I just
I<00:01:14.390> don't<00:01:14.450> know<00:01:14.570> what<00:01:14.750> happened<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.079> hit

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
I don't know what happened the hit

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.600 
I don't know what happened the hit
detection<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.799> stuff<00:01:15.979> isn't<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.460> great

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
detection and stuff isn't that great

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.219 
detection and stuff isn't that great
because<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.969> servers<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:17.869> came<00:01:18.049> online

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
because the servers just came online

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.349 
because the servers just came online
when<00:01:19.070> i<00:01:19.100> started<00:01:19.460> this<00:01:19.579> time<00:01:19.700> only<00:01:19.820> my<00:01:20.030> second

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
when i started this time only my second

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.840 
when i started this time only my second
match<00:01:20.539> so<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.829> servers<00:01:22.159> are<00:01:22.189> just<00:01:22.520> started

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
match so the servers are just started

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.700 
match so the servers are just started
coming<00:01:23.149> online<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.020> hit<00:01:24.140> detection<00:01:24.259> was<00:01:24.680> a

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
coming online so the hit detection was a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.990 
coming online so the hit detection was a
good<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.039> connection<00:01:25.430> wasn't<00:01:25.579> really<00:01:25.880> that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
good the connection wasn't really that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.740 
good the connection wasn't really that
great<00:01:26.210> but<00:01:27.219> it<00:01:28.219> was<00:01:28.280> still<00:01:28.579> a<00:01:28.609> blast<00:01:28.909> some

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
great but it was still a blast some

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.719 
great but it was still a blast some
things<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.049> look<00:01:30.140> out<00:01:30.229> for<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.619> you're<00:01:30.770> getting

things to look out for if you're getting
black<00:01:32.000> ops<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.299> haven't<00:01:32.539> played<00:01:32.689> in<00:01:32.840> and

are<00:01:37.189> some<00:01:37.310> things<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.609> think<00:01:37.700> about<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.810> one

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
are some things to think about the one

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.919 
are some things to think about the one
m16<00:01:39.799> is<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.039> very<00:01:40.460> strong<00:01:41.060> weapon<00:01:41.329> once<00:01:41.810> again

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
m16 is a very strong weapon once again

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.649 
m16 is a very strong weapon once again
in<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.320> call<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.590> duty<00:01:42.619> series<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.460> has<00:01:44.000> low

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
in the call of duty series it has low

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.139 
in the call of duty series it has low
recoil<00:01:44.929> and<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.039> puts<00:01:46.490> people<00:01:46.640> down<00:01:46.909> pretty

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
recoil and it puts people down pretty

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.730 
recoil and it puts people down pretty
quick<00:01:47.359> one<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.719> two<00:01:47.869> bursts<00:01:48.259> depending<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.649> how

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
quick one to two bursts depending on how

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.440 
quick one to two bursts depending on how
many<00:01:48.799> bolts<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.249> hit<00:01:49.399> them<00:01:49.460> with<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:50.210> you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
many bolts you hit them with like you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.810 
many bolts you hit them with like you
know<00:01:50.539> how<00:01:50.659> many<00:01:50.840> Bercy<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.320> target<00:01:51.679> so<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:52.670> you

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
know how many Bercy on target so if you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.999 
know how many Bercy on target so if you
shoot<00:01:53.149> one<00:01:53.210> verse<00:01:53.570> that's<00:01:53.840> three<00:01:54.049> rounds<00:01:54.469> you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
shoot one verse that's three rounds you

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.469 
shoot one verse that's three rounds you
get<00:01:55.159> out<00:01:55.280> all<00:01:55.429> three<00:01:55.640> rounds<00:01:55.909> on<00:01:55.999> target<00:01:56.030> in

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
get out all three rounds on target in

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.230 
get out all three rounds on target in
the<00:01:56.990> upper<00:01:57.200> area<00:01:57.469> he's<00:01:57.649> dead<00:01:57.890> but<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.030> fact

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
the upper area he's dead but the fact

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.550 
the upper area he's dead but the fact
that<00:01:59.270> doesn't<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.719> much<00:01:59.869> recoil<00:02:00.289> is

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
that doesn't have much recoil is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.969 
that doesn't have much recoil is
definitely<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:02.390> know<00:02:02.509> it's<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:03.079> no<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.649> don't

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
definitely you know it's a no I don't

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.039 
definitely you know it's a no I don't
say<00:02:04.130> drawback<00:02:04.609> but<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.119> does<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:05.689> annoying

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
say drawback but it does it's annoying

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.650 
say drawback but it does it's annoying
for<00:02:06.380> some<00:02:06.590> people<00:02:06.859> just<00:02:07.039> because<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:08.270> it's

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
for some people just because it's it's

for some people just because it's it's
overpowered<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.710> sense<00:02:10.240> I'm<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.390> mp5k

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
overpowered in a sense I'm the mp5k

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.690 
overpowered in a sense I'm the mp5k
is<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.909> very<00:02:14.209> strong<00:02:14.510> submachine<00:02:15.290> gun<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.159> when

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
is a very strong submachine gun so when

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.280 
is a very strong submachine gun so when
you<00:02:16.790> start<00:02:16.969> out<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.239> game<00:02:17.420> your<00:02:17.629> custom<00:02:18.019> or

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you start out the game your custom or

you start out the game your custom or
that<00:02:18.859> you<00:02:19.430> know<00:02:19.519> classes<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.209> come<00:02:20.480> there<00:02:20.719> I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
that you know classes that come there I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.479 
that you know classes that come there I
don't<00:02:21.590> know<00:02:21.650> what<00:02:21.769> they're<00:02:21.799> called<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
don't know what they're called just the

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.280 
don't know what they're called just the
classes<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.090> get<00:02:23.299> with<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.599> game<00:02:23.810> and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
classes that you get with the game and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.780 
classes that you get with the game and
once<00:02:24.439> that<00:02:24.469> you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.709> use<00:02:24.890> default<00:02:25.310> classes

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
once that you can use default classes

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.759 
once that you can use default classes
there<00:02:25.939> we<00:02:26.060> go<00:02:26.180> with<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> different<00:02:27.590> classes

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
there we go with the different classes

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.369 
there we go with the different classes
there's<00:02:28.189> m16<00:02:28.790> class<00:02:28.969> in<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.329> mp5<00:02:29.870> class<00:02:30.139> I

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
there's m16 class in the mp5 class I

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.920 
there's m16 class in the mp5 class I
suggest<00:02:30.889> only<00:02:31.099> use<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.549> those<00:02:31.700> two<00:02:31.879> classes<00:02:32.060> do

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
suggest only use in those two classes do

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.160 
suggest only use in those two classes do
not<00:02:33.109> use<00:02:33.439> the<00:02:33.799> lmg<00:02:34.459> or<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.420> sniper<00:02:35.659> rifle<00:02:35.989> if

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
not use the lmg or the sniper rifle if

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.509 
not use the lmg or the sniper rifle if
you<00:02:36.290> want<00:02:36.469> to<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.799> try<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.069> get<00:02:37.159> familiar

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
you want to just try and get familiar

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.910 
you want to just try and get familiar
with<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> game<00:02:38.030> because<00:02:38.870> they're<00:02:39.409> very<00:02:39.709> hard

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
with the game because they're very hard

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.020 
with the game because they're very hard
to<00:02:40.040> their<00:02:40.670> very<00:02:40.849> difficult<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.359> use<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
to their very difficult to use so I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.720 
to their very difficult to use so I
recommend<00:02:44.030> sticking<00:02:44.420> either<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.200> or<00:02:45.439> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
recommend sticking either this or the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.030 
recommend sticking either this or the
mp5k<00:02:46.730> class<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.840> you'll<00:02:48.379> be<00:02:48.500> pretty<00:02:48.739> set<00:02:48.919> to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
mp5k class and you'll be pretty set to

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.289 
mp5k class and you'll be pretty set to
just<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.370> used<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.669> and<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.909> can<00:02:50.030> go<00:02:50.180> from

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
just get used to and you can go from

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.780 
just get used to and you can go from
there<00:02:50.389> what<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.489> one<00:02:52.669> I'm<00:02:52.760> using

watch<00:03:32.419> out<00:03:32.599> for<00:03:32.659> it<00:03:32.959> because<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.199> can<00:03:33.319> be

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349

annoying when you're trying to kill
someone<00:03:34.609> you've<00:03:35.090> dropped<00:03:35.329> me<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.659> you're

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
like okay well I kill them so they

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.189 
like okay well I kill them so they
shouldn't<00:03:37.939> get<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.180> second<00:03:38.540> chance<00:03:38.569> it's<00:03:39.019> like

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
shouldn't get a second chance it's like

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.050 
shouldn't get a second chance it's like
you<00:03:39.590> got<00:03:39.799> clearly<00:03:40.040> hot<00:03:40.310> played<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:40.879> just<00:03:41.599> die

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
you got clearly hot played so just die

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.149 
you got clearly hot played so just die
so<00:03:44.060> be<00:03:44.180> careful<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.659> that<00:03:44.689> and<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.799> knifing

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
so be careful of that and the knifing

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.589 
so be careful of that and the knifing
range<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.639> probably<00:03:46.909> the<00:03:47.030> last<00:03:47.239> thing<00:03:47.359> I'd<00:03:47.569> say

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
range is probably the last thing I'd say

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.210 
range is probably the last thing I'd say
to<00:03:47.840> be<00:03:47.989> careful<00:03:48.349> of<00:03:48.470> because<00:03:48.859> that's

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
to be careful of because that's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.860 
to be careful of because that's
frustrating<00:03:49.759> as<00:03:49.819> well<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.209> almost<00:03:50.389> feels<00:03:50.750> like

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
frustrating as well it almost feels like

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.099 
frustrating as well it almost feels like
commando<00:03:51.439> sometimes<00:03:51.979> so<00:03:52.819> knifing<00:03:53.750> second

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
to play a little more defensive because

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.940 
to play a little more defensive because
I<00:05:29.900> was<00:05:30.020> running<00:05:30.200> around<00:05:30.260> I'm<00:05:30.530> playing<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.830> with

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
I was running around I'm playing it with

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.529 
I was running around I'm playing it with
a<00:05:30.979> bunch<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.250> random<00:05:31.610> guys<00:05:31.760> which<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.060> never<00:05:32.120> do

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
a bunch of random guys which I never do

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.990 
a bunch of random guys which I never do
I'm<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:33.860> used<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.130> playing<00:05:34.250> with<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.460> full<00:05:34.610> party

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
I'm so used to playing with a full party

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.450 
I'm so used to playing with a full party
so<00:05:35.320> playing<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.410> these<00:05:36.500> random<00:05:36.860> guys<00:05:37.010> they

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
so playing with these random guys they

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.740 
so playing with these random guys they
don't<00:05:37.669> listen<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.120> they<00:05:38.210> were<00:05:38.330> pushing

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
don't listen and they were pushing

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.240 
don't listen and they were pushing
spawns<00:05:39.050> and<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.500> swans<00:05:39.770> were<00:05:39.889> flipping

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
spawns and the swans were flipping

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.860 
spawns and the swans were flipping
everywhere<00:05:40.580> and<00:05:40.820> so<00:05:41.210> I<00:05:41.240> had<00:05:41.419> to<00:05:41.450> start<00:05:41.660> playing

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
everywhere and so I had to start playing

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.839 
everywhere and so I had to start playing
defensively<00:05:42.349> and<00:05:42.530> playing<00:05:42.800> smart<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.700> that's

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
defensively and playing smart and that's

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.850 
defensively and playing smart and that's
what<00:05:43.970> got<00:05:44.090> my<00:05:44.210> kill<00:05:44.419> death<00:05:44.539> positive<00:05:45.080> I<00:05:45.410> start

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
you're going to start playing the first

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.860 
you're going to start playing the first
time<00:05:52.120> doing<00:05:53.120> a<00:05:53.180> mercenary<00:05:53.660> team<00:05:53.840> deathmatch

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
time doing a mercenary team deathmatch

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.570 
time doing a mercenary team deathmatch
first<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.800> all<00:05:54.889> because<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.220> don't<00:05:55.400> want<00:05:55.430> to

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
first of all because you don't want to

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.740 
first of all because you don't want to
play<00:05:55.639> against<00:05:55.910> the<00:05:56.030> party<00:05:56.300> for<00:05:56.479> your<00:05:56.570> first

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
play against the party for your first

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.040 
play against the party for your first
few<00:05:56.990> games<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:58.479> because<00:05:59.479> I<00:05:59.510> mean<00:05:59.720> if<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.900> play

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
few games and because I mean if you play

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.900 
few games and because I mean if you play
a<00:06:00.080> regular<00:06:00.229> team<00:06:00.590> deathmatch<00:06:00.949> the<00:06:01.460> likelihood

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
a regular team deathmatch the likelihood

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.939 
a regular team deathmatch the likelihood
of<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.150> getting<00:06:02.180> into<00:06:02.810> a<00:06:03.199> game<00:06:03.500> with<00:06:03.680> someone

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
of you getting into a game with someone

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.290 
of you getting into a game with someone

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
else that's in a party is very high

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.760 
else that's in a party is very high
because<00:06:05.960> that's<00:06:06.229> what<00:06:06.349> everyone's<00:06:06.590> going<00:06:06.710> to

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
because that's what everyone's going to

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.890 
because that's what everyone's going to
