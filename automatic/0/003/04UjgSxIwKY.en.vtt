applications from Saunders game we

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.479 
applications from Saunders game we
started<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.330> work<00:00:36.449> with<00:00:36.720> solid<00:00:37.080> scape<00:00:37.489> 2003

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
started to work with solid scape 2003

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.890 
started to work with solid scape 2003
and<00:00:39.290> we<00:00:40.290> had<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> tremendous<00:00:40.890> grow<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.309> them

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
and we had a tremendous grow with them

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.569 
and we had a tremendous grow with them
Sol<00:00:42.900> Escape<00:00:43.199> is<00:00:43.230> perfect<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.890> casting<00:00:44.309> why

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
Sol Escape is perfect for casting why

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.780 
Sol Escape is perfect for casting why
it's<00:00:44.910> quite<00:00:45.150> easy<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.449> explain<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.790> the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
it's quite easy to explain because the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.819 
it's quite easy to explain because the
material<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.750> used<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.289> wax<00:00:49.500> it's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
material that is used to wax it's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
material that is used to wax it's
perfect<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.489> casting<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.300> no<00:00:51.480> special

curve no special equipment needed it's a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
curve no special equipment needed it's a
standard<00:00:55.050> process<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.329> that's

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
standard process you can use and that's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.310 
standard process you can use and that's
the<00:00:57.510> big<00:00:57.719> advantage<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.910> just<00:00:59.910> print<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.870> go

when<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> received<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.600> first<00:01:06.840> studio<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
when we received the first studio and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
when we received the first studio and
we've<00:01:08.039> heard<00:01:08.280> about<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.700> pricing<00:01:09.270> we're

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
we've heard about the pricing we're

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
we've heard about the pricing we're
getting<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> future<00:01:10.130> we're<00:01:11.130> absolutely

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
getting in the future we're absolutely

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.430 
getting in the future we're absolutely
amazed<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.259> what

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
amazed by that because this is what

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.410 
amazed by that because this is what
we've<00:01:13.649> wandered<00:01:14.160> all<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.580> time<00:01:14.789> because<00:01:15.030> now

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
we've wandered all the time because now

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.480 
we've wandered all the time because now
we<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.810> machine<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.410> price<00:01:16.649> level<00:01:17.039> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
we have a machine at a price level that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210 
we have a machine at a price level that
is<00:01:17.750> more<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.929> interesting<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:20.009> more

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

years<00:01:36.660> ago<00:01:36.869> miska<00:01:37.410> models<00:01:37.830> bought<00:01:38.539> their

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
years ago miska models bought their

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.870 
years ago miska models bought their
first<00:01:39.569> printer<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.319> us<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.709> they<00:01:41.369> started

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
first printer from us and they started

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.449 
first printer from us and they started
to<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.989> printer<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.709> everyday

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
to use that printer in everyday

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.180 
to use that printer in everyday
development<00:01:45.209> for<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.539> new<00:01:45.869> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.709> models

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
development for the new kind of models

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.270 
development for the new kind of models
and<00:01:47.630> especially<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.380> advantage<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.160> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and especially the advantage of that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
and especially the advantage of that
technology<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.239> them<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.720> surface

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
technology for them is the surface

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.969 
technology for them is the surface
finish<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.739> quality<00:01:53.280> over<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.869> whole<00:01:55.110> model

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
finish the quality over the whole model

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
finish the quality over the whole model
surface<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:56.610> also<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.599> precision<00:01:58.080> that's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
surface and also the precision that's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.469 
surface and also the precision that's
absolutely<00:01:58.920> important<00:01:59.489> for<00:01:59.640> them<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.940> no

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
absolutely important for them and no

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.719 
absolutely important for them and no
other<00:02:00.750> technology<00:02:01.560> gave<00:02:01.830> them<00:02:02.160> that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other technology gave them that

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.770 
other technology gave them that
advantage<00:02:03.179> especially<00:02:03.660> for<00:02:04.349> casting<00:02:04.800> parts

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
advantage especially for casting parts

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.919 
advantage especially for casting parts
it's<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.140> easy<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:08.129> use<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:09.270> means<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.660> don't

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it's so easy in use that means you don't

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.339 
it's so easy in use that means you don't
need<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.560> engineer<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.349> unpack

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
need to be an engineer you can unpack

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.650 
need to be an engineer you can unpack
the<00:02:13.620> machine<00:02:13.980> place<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.510> can

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the machine place it and you can

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.320 
the machine place it and you can
immediately<00:02:16.050> start<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.739> work<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:18.090> means

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
immediately start to work that means

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.720 
immediately start to work that means
they<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.200> their<00:02:19.230> job<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.980> calculate

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
they just have their job they calculate

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.059 
they just have their job they calculate
the<00:02:20.910> job<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.080> build<00:02:22.410> play<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the job put the build play to the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.679 
the job put the build play to the
machine<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.849> hit<00:02:24.030> start<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.599> that

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
machine and just hit start and that

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.899 
machine and just hit start and that
makes<00:02:25.469> it<00:02:25.829> so<00:02:26.640> easy<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:27.090> never<00:02:27.299> before

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
makes it so easy like never before
