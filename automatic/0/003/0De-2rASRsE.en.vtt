fashion<00:05:55.550> sense<00:05:55.850> I<00:05:56.200> think<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.350> mohawk<00:05:58.130> would<00:05:58.700> be

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
fashion sense I think a mohawk would be

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.760

in<00:05:59.419> an<00:05:59.600> OLAP<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.020> would<00:06:00.200> certainly<00:06:00.350> be<00:06:00.530> more

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770
