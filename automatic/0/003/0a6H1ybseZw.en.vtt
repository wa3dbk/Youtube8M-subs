00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:10.620
 rudd wrasse kuban because it has 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.139
 the characteristic structure of the lip is a fish in which 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.089
 so many fork bones so in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.699
 common people 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.189
 got the name bony used 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.350
 mainly for cooking meatballs and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 ear 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:30.510
 however with a little fish processing 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199
 can be cooked both in the oven and on 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.969
 skillet 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.890
 workers tasty well here are fork bones 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.719
 a little spoils the reputation of the fish cleaned 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.980
 in order to shred you need a good one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.199
 a sharp knife, preferably with a thin blade 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 the fish will crawl to the ridge in 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.320
 the location of the fork bones bones 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 are located along the entire length of the tail and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.129
 along the ridge of fish shred that part 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.680
 fish which is located 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.030
 meaning there is no rib I like 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.100
 shred when fish lies back to me 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 someone chop 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.320
 crap fish on the contrary principled 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 it doesnâ€™t matter 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.259
 cut through 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:31.790
 to the ridge all the bones and shredder 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.360
 happens in a way that between 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 roughly about 57 millimeters there 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.479
 some housewives manage to shred and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.659
 more subtly 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.110
 because when cooking in fish 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.410
 gets into 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.840
 oil and fish become more juicy 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.840
 if suddenly the fish was breadcrumbs 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540
 Yes 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.920
 the meat is cut completely to the ridge of the fish 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.950
 turn over and move in reverse 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.950
 direction 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.069
 rush no sense shredder quality 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.459
 or the speed of the shredder it comes with 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:44.970
 as a result, we get this 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.750
 Babu finely chopped fish 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.090
 all bones are not the same size 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.700
 more than 5 millimeters when cooking 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.410
 bones become soft and meat 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.980
 completely eaten remain only 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.980
 ribs and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.810
 ridge part 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.300
 and bony fish turned into very 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.390
 delicious healthy product is the same 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.120
 the way tires are forged all all the fish have 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.569
 which there are fork bones which 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 applies for example carp rudd 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.459
 cut into pieces because small 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.860
 pan and fish do not fit entirely 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.760
 only for this is very important to note 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.130
 that eating shredded fish we eat 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.570
 a large number of small bones and in 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.060
 the body gets very large 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.560
 amount of calcium and if we are fish and we 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.180
 we sit I delete bones respectively 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.060
 the product has no such value from the point 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.450
 view of calcium fish just roll in 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.859
 flour the old grandfather's way and fry 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.650
 on the skillet on readiness some 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.140
 unaccustomed people try to do so 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.640
 Come to hit it between the shredder 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.160
 absolutely no need to do this 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.609
 crumbles like ordinary fish surplus 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.609
 shake off flour 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.520
 so that the fish does not fall apart in 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.230
 cooking time 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.510
 It remains generally so afraid that 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.420
 will begin to fall apart and cause some 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.420
 difficulty making 5 cm is 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.980
 Well, not to
