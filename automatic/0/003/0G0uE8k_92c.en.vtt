00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.460
 we will talk about your life well then 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.960
 that he was born in 1968 in Ghana of a mother 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.380
 Ghanaian who incidentally returned 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 live in accra and the three children of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.340
 three different fathers is one day your 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 mother meets sir two thresholds them 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 diplomats white but who works for 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.260
 the ghana and unlike your brother 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.740
 7 to bear your father's name 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 adoptive 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.059
 hence the name marcel of thresholds when 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750
 your father came to nantes he 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.219
 was coming from Ghana based ba 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 directly from me we went 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.200
 directly from Ghana this city of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.219
 nantes 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 so you have a childhood rather 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.270
 favor no compared to young people's 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.470
 suburb since I militated in a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.330
 beautiful district 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.100
 good neighborhoods of nantes so that's 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.660
 true that for me I do not identify myself 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.070
 necessarily but there is an offset 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.600
 today when you encounter 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.120
 people like anelka who were really 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.200
 raised in the cities no I am a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.700
 big available we have a 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.290
 difference in the near in the 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.670
 speeches also in the language also 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.040
 somewhere but hey we are not 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.150
 really far away like that anyway at 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.050
 you started soccer at the age of 8 1 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.340
 I'm not bad at tennis this 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.790
 who says schÃ¼ttler discuss the one 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.530
 reverse 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.270
 he finished tennis starting with the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.590
 football where you start with tennis if 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.820
 you end up in football you prefer 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.869
 the collective sports talk is for 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.300
 what you chose football you 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.910
 know I was not doing around 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.140
 12 12 years old that I had to choose between 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.490
 football and tennis because 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.650
 I had a teacher who believed 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.119
 a lot in me and good that bother me 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.860
 who encouraged me but who 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.090
 to yell too is good I have not 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.200
 supported what I said I'd rather go 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.780
 in the collective laughing with the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 buddies and we will be better off then 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.600
 you arrive at the training center 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.710
 of nantes where you meet didier 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.030
 Deschamps with whom how it is 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.420
 became very friendly and at that time in 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.270
 84 you are the victim of a very ordeal 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.020
 difficult that is a little rocking 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.420
 your existence 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.790
 it's the death of your half brother so 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.760
 what she had kept him the name of 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.810
 his father still has to hesitate your 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.019
 ideal your brother you loved him 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.269
 a lot you worshiped when it's played 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.980
 you wax him the shoes stay 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.930
 really your your god and he dies 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.440
 in a car accident and the day 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.209
 overnight you changed and told you 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.190
 babu finally says that you wear them 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.230
 a little bit in your place the hopes 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.489
 of your brother that's it 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.350
 let's say you know in a family 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.790
 good him was enjoying footballer 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.290
 professional we have relied a lot on 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 he and I were young first good 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.930
 I'm also trying to do my classes at 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.459
 training center 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.810
 but it's true that from the moment 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.640
 there are some who disappears you feel a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.470
 little bit as if you have a mission 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.610
 so the real old one and there you know 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.170
 there at that moment you know that you 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.100
 want to become a pro footballer and then 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.209
 somehow work a lot 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.930
 to live a little bit of destiny 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.460
 that he could have 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.600
 good I was already in the 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.340
 the in the circuit anyway 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.620
 good it gave me a little bit more 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.240
 force for for let's say for let's say 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.950
 to cross the different levels 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.300
 different stages what the force a 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.430
 responsibility also in relation to him 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.600
 you thought not about him by 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.960
 compared to the family because that's 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.670
 true that good 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.990
 it was a little bit this is it was the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.820
 feeling that it was necessary to hold a small 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.350
 little family socially I mean 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.450
 the master to succeed in football that 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.460
 allowed a little to give some 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.890
 facilities in the end of course then you 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.120
 play nantes you play marseille on 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.690
 time to win the European Cup of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.700
 champions clubs 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.590
 and then after there are the cases that 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.330
 come to marseille at om 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.290
 and there they sell you I always 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.460
 found that extraordinary in the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.450
 football we sell they sell you 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.060
 at milan ac 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:41.820
 when we sell you as a slave is 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.840
 what you agree not there yes bah 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.880
 we always have our say 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.620
 I mean we will sign not a sign 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.060
 but there it was too interesting I want 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.470
 to say milan ac after the prestigious 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.490
 yes anyway like that and it's true 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.810

 best time no yeah that's nice 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.730
 because I found a coach who 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.660
 was super smart with me he knows 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.950
 that we could think that I was going 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.780
 plant because good I was one of 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.460
 French first especially I was not the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.660
 star in France at that moment when we 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.110
 arrived in italy we wondered 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.400
 question 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.680
 he's going to crash I've met a 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.700
 coach who will really understand 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.410
 and who made me play in a position 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.210
 which was really lame that me 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.250
 corresponded then she stable also san 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.510
 siro with the 80000 people who 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.390
 scream is to do something not

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.070
 you play all the matches except the 23 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.680
 last minutes of the final you are 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.340
 expelled for having shot a Brazilian 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.450
 Cafu and you get out of the output tray 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.450
