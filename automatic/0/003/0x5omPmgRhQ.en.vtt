okay<00:00:02.370> what<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:02.700> have<00:00:02.730> here<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.389> got<00:00:03.540> our<00:00:03.570> new

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay what we have here is we got our new

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.150 
okay what we have here is we got our new
snap-on<00:00:04.950> battery<00:00:05.310> charger<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.879> e<00:00:06.470> EBC<00:00:07.470> 500

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
snap-on battery charger the e EBC 500

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.580 
snap-on battery charger the e EBC 500
and<00:00:09.090> what<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.420> got<00:00:09.540> set<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:09.870> here<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.349> got<00:00:10.440> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
and what we got set up here is we got to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.740 
and what we got set up here is we got to
set<00:00:10.740> up<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.860> maintain<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> 13<00:00:11.910> volt<00:00:12.179> charge<00:00:12.540> we

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
set up the maintain a 13 volt charge we

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.589 
set up the maintain a 13 volt charge we
got<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.139> flash<00:00:13.410> programming<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> car

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
got it in flash programming we got a car

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.200 
got it in flash programming we got a car
here<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.320> key<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> headlights

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
here with the key on so the headlights

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.240 
here with the key on so the headlights
are<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.779> we're<00:00:18.960> obviously<00:00:19.380> drawing<00:00:20.070> some

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
are on so we're obviously drawing some

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.970 
are on so we're obviously drawing some
amperage<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:20.880> bit<00:00:21.060> probably<00:00:21.270> 30<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.619> amps

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
amperage our bit probably 30 or so amps

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.200 
amperage our bit probably 30 or so amps
out<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> battery<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> car<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.180> what<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
out of the battery in the car and what I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
out of the battery in the car and what I
did<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.750> got<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:28.199> amp<00:00:28.380> probe<00:00:28.710> hooked<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.220> on

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
did is I got my amp probe hooked up on

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.659 
did is I got my amp probe hooked up on
the<00:00:30.529> battery<00:00:31.529> cable<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> battery

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the battery cable going to the battery

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
the battery cable going to the battery
and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.030> got<00:00:33.210> Tesla<00:00:33.719> hooked<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> show

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and then I got Tesla hooked up the show

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.030 
and then I got Tesla hooked up the show
voltage<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.160> got<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.700> now<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
voltage and so what I got here now is a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.110 
voltage and so what I got here now is a
what<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> Green<00:00:41.820> Line<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what you see here on the Green Line is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.389 
what you see here on the Green Line is
the<00:00:42.360> amperage<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the amperage and what we see on the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299 
the amperage and what we see on the
yellow<00:00:44.579> line<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.390> AC<00:00:46.110> ripple<00:00:46.620> coming<00:00:47.160> off

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
yellow line here is AC ripple coming off

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
yellow line here is AC ripple coming off
the<00:00:47.489> battery<00:00:47.820> charger<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> idea<00:00:48.780> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the battery charger so the idea that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.200 
the battery charger so the idea that
you're<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.160> any<00:00:50.460> ripple<00:00:50.969> off

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you're not going to get any ripple off

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
you're not going to get any ripple off
of<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.690> battery<00:00:52.110> chargers<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:53.010> ain't<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of these battery chargers just ain't the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.400 
of these battery chargers just ain't the
case<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:54.270> every<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> spike

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
case because every time you get a spike

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.400 
case because every time you get a spike
in<00:00:59.149> amperage<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.480> volt<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.050> gonna

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
in amperage your volt it's gonna

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
in amperage your volt it's gonna
inevitably<00:01:02.129> unless<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> really

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
inevitably unless you got a really

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.200 
inevitably unless you got a really
really<00:01:04.110> big<00:01:04.320> battery<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> bump<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
really big battery it's going to bump up

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
really big battery it's going to bump up
the<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> bump<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.799> voltage

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the it's going to bump up your voltage

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
the it's going to bump up your voltage
but<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.090> running<00:01:09.590> all

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
but you can see here we're running all

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
but you can see here we're running all
probably<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.310> 500<00:01:12.119> millivolts<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:14.750> well

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
probably about 500 millivolts of well

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.300 
probably about 500 millivolts of well
actually<00:01:16.229> probably<00:01:16.409> made<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.070> about

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
actually probably made more like about

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
actually probably made more like about
800<00:01:17.790> millivolts<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:19.850> AC<00:01:20.850> ripple<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
800 millivolts of AC ripple from the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
800 millivolts of AC ripple from the
battery<00:01:22.470> charger<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.520> don't

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
battery charger so and actually I don't

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.880 
battery charger so and actually I don't
think<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.930> fair<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> call<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
think it's really fair even to call it a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
think it's really fair even to call it a
CE<00:01:28.950> ripple<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> low<00:01:30.150> point<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
CE ripple because at the low point it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.310 
CE ripple because at the low point it
it's<00:01:31.680> down<00:01:31.979> about<00:01:32.280> 0.02<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.140> goes<00:01:34.290> up

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it's down about 0.02 and then it goes up

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's down about 0.02 and then it goes up
to<00:01:34.850> about<00:01:35.850> 0.6<00:01:36.630> volts<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.340> idea<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.759> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
to about 0.6 volts so the idea that this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980 
to about 0.6 volts so the idea that this
thing<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.500> set<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.340> 13<00:01:41.759> volts<00:01:42.210> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
thing that you set this at 13 volts that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.170 
thing that you set this at 13 volts that
you're<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.829> 13<00:01:44.280> volts<00:01:44.670> steady

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you're just going to get 13 volts steady

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.660 
you're just going to get 13 volts steady
it<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.590> doesn't<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.100> work<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.399> way

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it just it doesn't really work that way

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.770 
it just it doesn't really work that way
will<00:01:48.600> change<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> trace<00:01:49.409> here

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
will change the trace here

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.290 
will change the trace here
so<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.110> instead<00:01:51.410> of<00:01:51.470> AC<00:01:51.710> ripple<00:01:52.130> will<00:01:53.000> show

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
so that instead of AC ripple will show

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.340 
so that instead of AC ripple will show
actual<00:01:54.290> voltage<00:01:56.350> bring<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.530> down<00:01:57.950> here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
actual voltage bring this down here

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.170 
actual voltage bring this down here
agathiyar<00:02:00.350> actual<00:02:01.070> voltage<00:02:01.250> we're<00:02:01.760> running

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
agathiyar actual voltage we're running

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180 
agathiyar actual voltage we're running
right<00:02:02.330> around<00:02:02.420> 14<00:02:03.140> even<00:02:03.530> though<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:03.830> got<00:02:03.950> this

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
right around 14 even though we got this

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.390 
right around 14 even though we got this
set<00:02:04.430> at<00:02:04.580> 13<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.350> calibrated<00:02:07.070> pretty

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
set at 13 and this is calibrated pretty

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.120 
set at 13 and this is calibrated pretty
close<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.970> would<00:02:08.030> think<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:09.289> still<00:02:09.560> see<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
close I would think that you still see a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.270 
close I would think that you still see a
little<00:02:11.000> bit<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.390> spike<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:12.020> your<00:02:12.500> voltage<00:02:12.980> as

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
little bit of spike in your voltage as

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.180 
little bit of spike in your voltage as
you<00:02:14.170> every<00:02:15.170> time<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.530> gives<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.920> little<00:02:16.070> bit

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
you every time it gives it a little bit

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.480 
you every time it gives it a little bit
of<00:02:16.510> juice<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.500> demonstrated<00:02:19.280> by<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
of juice as it's demonstrated by the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.160 
of juice as it's demonstrated by the
current<00:02:20.390> wave<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:21.310> your<00:02:22.310> amperage<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.239> what<00:02:23.870> I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
current wave of your amperage so what I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.630 
current wave of your amperage so what I
do<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.739> just<00:02:25.390> flip<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.600> around<00:02:26.660> here

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
do here is just flip this around here

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.240 
do here is just flip this around here
and<00:02:28.900> what<00:02:29.900> kind<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.290> surprised<00:02:30.650> me<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.130> I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and what kind of surprised me is that I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.979 
and what kind of surprised me is that I
got<00:02:34.250> my<00:02:34.430> other<00:02:34.580> battery<00:02:35.060> charger<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.510> old<00:02:35.750> one

got my other battery charger the old one

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:45.520 
got my other battery charger the old one
here<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:41.110> can<00:02:42.110> get<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.940> over<00:02:43.940> here<00:02:44.270> I'll<00:02:44.989> just

the amperage there we are on the other
one<00:04:29.949> we<00:04:30.159> weren't<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.240> other<00:04:31.360> one<00:04:31.479> but<00:04:31.629> it<00:04:31.779> is

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
one we weren't the other one but it is

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.869 
one we weren't the other one but it is
very<00:04:32.289> very<00:04:33.159> similar<00:04:33.689> waveform<00:04:38.759> look<00:04:39.759> my

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.720 

there<00:04:43.420> we<00:04:43.600> go

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
there we go

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.030 
there we go
okay<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.570> now<00:04:46.810> just<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:47.140> demonstrate<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:50.040> AC

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
okay and now just to demonstrate the AC

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.190 
okay and now just to demonstrate the AC
ripple<00:04:51.460> off<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.300> regular<00:04:52.840> battery

charger<00:04:54.120> we'll<00:04:55.120> go<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.360> 2<00:04:55.720> volts<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.620> we'll<00:04:57.220> go

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
charger we'll go to 2 volts and we'll go

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.740 
charger we'll go to 2 volts and we'll go
to<00:04:57.430> AC<00:04:57.880> couple

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.830 

and<00:05:03.320> here<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:04.010> know<00:05:04.910> what's<00:05:05.150> going<00:05:05.390> on<00:05:05.480> with<00:05:05.660> my

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
and here I know what's going on with my

and here I know what's going on with my
am<00:05:05.960> procure<00:05:13.390> well<00:05:14.390> anyways<00:05:15.320> we<00:05:15.470> can<00:05:15.590> see<00:05:15.740> that

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
am procure well anyways we can see that

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.950 
am procure well anyways we can see that
our<00:05:16.040> AC<00:05:16.220> ripple<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:19.480> running<00:05:20.480> just<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.930> little

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
our AC ripple is running just a little

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.590 
our AC ripple is running just a little
bit<00:05:21.350> more<00:05:21.560> about<00:05:22.340> two<00:05:22.580> millivolts<00:05:23.150> more<00:05:23.390> with

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
bit more about two millivolts more with

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.240 
bit more about two millivolts more with
the<00:05:23.750> regular<00:05:24.050> battery<00:05:24.380> charger<00:05:24.830> than<00:05:25.070> with

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
the regular battery charger than with

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.730 
the regular battery charger than with
the<00:05:25.400> other<00:05:25.550> one<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:26.240> think<00:05:26.600> my<00:05:26.750> amp<00:05:27.020> pro<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:27.530> think

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
the other one I think my amp pro I think

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.860 
the other one I think my amp pro I think
the<00:05:27.860> battery<00:05:28.190> just<00:05:28.400> died<00:05:28.640> in<00:05:28.670> it<00:05:29.060> so<00:05:29.330> that's

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
the battery just died in it so that's

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.150 
the battery just died in it so that's
not<00:05:30.080> gonna<00:05:30.290> work<00:05:30.500> anymore<00:05:30.830> or<00:05:32.530> it's<00:05:33.530> in<00:05:33.950> the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
not gonna work anymore or it's in the

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.360 
not gonna work anymore or it's in the
process<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.880> dying<00:05:35.560> anyways<00:05:36.560> I<00:05:36.770> was<00:05:37.040> kind<00:05:37.340> of

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
process of dying anyways I was kind of

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.520 
process of dying anyways I was kind of
disappointed<00:05:37.490> that<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.810> wasn't<00:05:38.870> a<00:05:39.200> real<00:05:39.230> big

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
disappointed that it wasn't a real big

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.410 
disappointed that it wasn't a real big
difference<00:05:39.770> between<00:05:40.370> two<00:05:40.610> battery<00:05:40.970> chargers

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
difference between two battery chargers

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.970 
difference between two battery chargers
and<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.750> amount<00:05:41.960> of<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.140> C<00:05:42.200> ripple<00:05:42.740> but<00:05:43.100> I<00:05:44.980> guess

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
and the amount of a C ripple but I guess

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.310 
and the amount of a C ripple but I guess
it's<00:05:46.250> enough<00:05:46.910> to<00:05:47.120> cause<00:05:47.390> concern<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.170> big

it's enough to cause concern and the big

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.110 
it's enough to cause concern and the big
advantage<00:05:48.830> of<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.100> course<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.520> can<00:05:49.670> control

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
advantage of the course you can control

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.110 
advantage of the course you can control
your<00:05:50.300> voltage<00:05:50.810> with<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.800> other<00:05:52.130> with<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:52.970> new

your voltage with the other with the new

your voltage with the other with the new
snap-on<00:05:53.600> battery<00:05:54.020> charger<00:05:54.470> so<00:05:54.710> I<00:05:54.980> guess

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
snap-on battery charger so I guess

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.850 
snap-on battery charger so I guess
that's<00:05:55.520> about<00:05:55.700> it
