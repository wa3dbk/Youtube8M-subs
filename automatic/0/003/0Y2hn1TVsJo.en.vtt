I<00:02:42.310> also<00:02:43.310> did<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:47.170> old<00:02:48.170> coot<00:02:48.879> not<00:02:49.879> a<00:02:49.909> local

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
I also did the old coot not a local

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.270 
I also did the old coot not a local
powder<00:02:50.750> Stan<00:02:51.079> cooler<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.829> feed

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
powder Stan cooler so this is the feed

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.780 
powder Stan cooler so this is the feed
line<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.909> then<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.599> is<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.930> return<00:02:57.790> return

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
line and then this is to return return

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.110 
line and then this is to return return
line<00:02:59.239> so<00:03:00.109> he's<00:03:00.230> gonna<00:03:00.349> come<00:03:00.769> down<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.909> lane

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
line so he's gonna come down the lane

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.750 
line so he's gonna come down the lane
whatever<00:03:02.840> does<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.439> then<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:05.290> broke<00:03:06.290> my<00:03:06.760> power

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
whatever does and then I broke my power

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.280 
whatever does and then I broke my power
steering<00:03:08.299> because<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.599> try<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.870> take<00:03:09.109> the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
steering because I try to take the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.240 
steering because I try to take the
little<00:03:10.280> holes<00:03:10.459> up<00:03:11.650> try<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.739> take<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> little

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
little holes up try to take the little

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.369 
little holes up try to take the little
holes<00:03:13.720> off<00:03:14.720> today

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
holes off today

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.690 
holes off today
and<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:16.819> broke<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:18.560> plastic<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.519> go

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
and it broke so it's plastic so go

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.339 
and it broke so it's plastic so go
figure

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
figure

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.910 
figure
these<00:03:21.349> are<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.769> right<00:03:22.700> here<00:03:25.450> UPR<00:03:26.650> casters<00:03:27.650> so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
these are in right here UPR casters so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.699 
these are in right here UPR casters so
they're<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.579> I<00:03:28.959> can't<00:03:29.959> wait<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.260> go<00:03:30.379> get<00:03:30.590> this

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
they're in I can't wait to go get this

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:42.429 
they're in I can't wait to go get this
car<00:03:30.769> line<00:03:31.220> eventually<00:03:40.629> all<00:03:41.629> right<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:42.260> is

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
car line eventually all right so this is

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.080 
car line eventually all right so this is
a<00:03:42.470> maximum<00:03:43.159> lock<00:03:43.430> on<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.329> side<00:03:44.739> now<00:03:45.739> it<00:03:46.549> rubs

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
a maximum lock on this side now it rubs

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.039 
a maximum lock on this side now it rubs
on<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:48.199> side<00:03:48.470> on<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.120> inner<00:03:50.329> bumper<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.019> I

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
on this side on the inner bumper so I

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.159 
on this side on the inner bumper so I
guess<00:03:51.230> I'm<00:03:51.319> gonna<00:03:51.410> have<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.620> cut<00:03:51.889> this<00:03:52.069> out

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
guess I'm gonna have to cut this out

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.159 
guess I'm gonna have to cut this out
probably<00:03:54.169> have<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.889> lot<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.870> right<00:03:56.870> here

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
probably have a lot of this right here

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.640 
probably have a lot of this right here
just<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.639> fit<00:03:58.819> properly<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.599> other<00:04:00.349> than

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
just have it fit properly but other than

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.839 
just have it fit properly but other than
that<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:01.579> pretty<00:04:02.319> pretty<00:04:03.319> tight<00:04:03.620> I<00:04:04.930> mean<00:04:06.849> I'm

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
that it's pretty pretty tight I mean I'm

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:19.080 
that it's pretty pretty tight I mean I'm
trying<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:12.699> see<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.470> fix<00:04:16.159> that<00:04:16.370> in<00:04:16.549> alignment

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:34.920 

maximum<00:04:20.090> lock<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:23.240> yeah

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:43.499 

and<00:04:35.889> that's<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:36.880> for<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.240> few<00:04:37.509> days<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:43.030> don't

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
and that's it for a few days I don't

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.240 
and that's it for a few days I don't
know<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.870> got<00:04:44.169> that<00:04:44.410> end<00:04:45.370> link<00:04:45.669> on<00:04:46.000> let's<00:04:46.810> not

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
know I got that end link on let's not

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.510 
know I got that end link on let's not
straight

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
straight

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.540 
straight
probably<00:04:49.180> have<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.330> do<00:04:49.509> a<00:04:49.539> relocation<00:04:50.169> kit<00:04:50.590> but

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
probably have to do a relocation kit but

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.060 
probably have to do a relocation kit but
either<00:04:51.910> way<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.630> I'm<00:04:53.050> probably<00:04:53.470> gonna<00:04:53.710> snap

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
either way is on I'm probably gonna snap

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.490 
either way is on I'm probably gonna snap
it<00:04:54.280> but<00:04:54.520> whatever<00:04:54.940> I'm<00:04:55.630> gonna<00:04:55.780> snap<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.139> then

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
it but whatever I'm gonna snap it then

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.130 
it but whatever I'm gonna snap it then
relocate<00:04:56.949> it
