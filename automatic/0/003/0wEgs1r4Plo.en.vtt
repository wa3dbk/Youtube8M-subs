 started and save that it come to 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.600
 writer on the farm in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.910
 the exploitation of my parents one morning to 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.459
 10 hours 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.470
 we helped the mare Apolline and it was 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.360
 not very good but I'm good 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.610
 did not want to go to bed to do anything 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.170
 not the layer and was it was 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.630
 Pauline is standing my brother and I 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.130
 on frozen ground 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.690
 it was thought that the column was broken 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.350
 so that was over for her 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.350
 normally what 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.060
 call the vet who tried to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.159
 heal her and unfortunately they we 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.870
 said applying of anything 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.870
 that she was not going to get away with it 1 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.879
 the door and kneels down on it 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 put a penny the well of the mare and 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.080
 drink the sea gave herself thoroughly for her 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.720
 every night it was raining 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.349
 relayed all all to try to 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.489
 save this filly one morning she 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.420
 did not know of course the career she 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.730
 would have had but 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.020
 we guess is still that there has been 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.020
 something well below what 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.510
 originally she had to be called 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.520
 carlane and then we saved it's 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.860
 my brother who had the idea to apply it 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.140
 save koi kind we made the first 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.000

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.069
 first exit alone she had finished 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.510
 in the first three so big 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.209

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.600

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.780
 the age and the friends who arrived 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.780
