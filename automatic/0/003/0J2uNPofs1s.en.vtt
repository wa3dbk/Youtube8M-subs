00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.570
 always at cologne his place on the stand ktm main 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.330
 ktm who comes here as a neighbor and his Austrian this deployment of the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.239
 way 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.309
 and he unveils for the first time live new 125 biopsy 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 big bet of 2011 for ktm 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.920
 the ktm diouf 125 abn may be that a 125 is nevertheless an authentic 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.460
 ktm already well here in static she really looks like a ktm she is 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.899
 so at stake they all have many technical attributes how 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.000
 all the big bikes in the road range we start to find 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.140
 a frame entered he sits as on the super ktm of recoil and the others 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.780
 sports models from the range 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.710
 we also find a single-cylinder engine 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.830
 four-stroke 125 cubic centimeters double overhead cam he 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.520
 develops 15 horses 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.130
 to comply with the legislation by unsheathing ktm designed a very engine 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.130
 modern water cooled with electronic injection 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.910
 Japan also has a catalyst but what else does it have? 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.320
 I choose to put this very low exhaust always in the idea of 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.080
 centralize the masses the two clubs and that's the center of gravity to the maximum 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.260
 this ktm of hindsight 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.460
 keeps the true elements of they are loyal to ktm ie a 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.490
 cycle part 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.530
 really very neat we have a nice swing arm always set back 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.110
 honeycombed% to save weight as always ktm treats 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 suspensions with the greatest seriousness here we find a single shock wp 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670
 who is an almost exclusive supplier 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.710
 contacted m this mono shock absorber work live without defeat 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.570
 we find at the front an inverted fork 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 larger diameter always signed wp of course 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 at the level of the ergonomics of the driving position this new measure 125 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.940
 it is indeed ktm 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.250
 it is drawn with very prominent angles so much in euros 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 ergonomics is rather successful 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.580
 we are very close to the fork is a small size the bike is very short 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.440
 so we see that although it is very natural there is no 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.299
 constraints on the handlebars 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.989
 then the ktm does not play 125 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.299
 also inaugurates a new collaboration at ktm it depends 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.529
 fully designed 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.169
 in austria at mattighofen m 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.169
 whether for the engine the design part-cycle 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.459
 but it is fully manufactured assembled 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.269
 in ardeche and bajaj a motorcycle industry giant 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.569
 this collaboration will allow ktm economies of scale 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.879
 they will be able to produce more easily 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.180
 this new duke 125 keep them an aggressive price sold around 4000 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.909
 euros next spring 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.380
 we'll see if this future comes to 5 times its audience 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.080
 in France or not
