anyway is the nikon d750 now a lot of
people<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.190> saying<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.759> d750<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.900> what

people are saying that the d750 is what

people are saying that the d750 is what
the<00:00:16.440> d600<00:00:17.010> or<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> d610<00:00:18.150> should<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.510> always

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the d600 or the d610 should have always

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.410 
the d600 or the d610 should have always
been<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.920> people<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:20.310> saying<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
been some people are saying it is the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.470 
been some people are saying it is the
d700<00:00:22.410> replacement<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.279> never<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.730> other

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
d700 replacement that we never got other

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.779 
d700 replacement that we never got other
people<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.050> saying<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.650> not<00:00:26.039> but

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
people are saying it's not but

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
people are saying it's not but
essentially<00:00:27.510> there<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:27.990> five<00:00:28.439> main<00:00:28.859> reasons

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
essentially there are five main reasons

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.940 
essentially there are five main reasons
why<00:00:29.580> you'd<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> d750<00:00:31.260> over<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.669> d610<00:00:33.450> ad

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
why you'd want the d750 over the d610 ad

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.880 
why you'd want the d750 over the d610 ad
there's<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> huge<00:00:35.700> price<00:00:36.059> difference<00:00:36.090> here

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
there's not a huge price difference here

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
there's not a huge price difference here
basically<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.250> few<00:00:38.489> hundred<00:00:38.820> dollars<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.360> i'm

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
basically a few hundred dollars and i'm

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.240 
basically a few hundred dollars and i'm
sure<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.170> some<00:00:40.500> sales<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
sure we're going to see some sales and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.450 
sure we're going to see some sales and
some<00:00:41.430> discounts<00:00:41.940> coming<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.629> come<00:00:42.840> into

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
some discounts coming up as we come into

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.619 
some discounts coming up as we come into
Christmas<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> even<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> Black

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
Christmas and even into like the Black

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.650 
Christmas and even into like the Black
Friday<00:00:46.020> season<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.710> will<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.980> coming<00:00:47.160> up

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
Friday season which will be coming up

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.439 
Friday season which will be coming up
basically<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.770> big<00:00:50.460> thing<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
basically the first big thing that's an

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.569 
basically the first big thing that's an
advantage<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.530> d750<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.239> new<00:00:54.390> 50<00:00:55.579> 1.15

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
advantage on the d750 is the new 50 1.15

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.290 
advantage on the d750 is the new 50 1.15
cross-type<00:00:58.789> autofocus<00:00:59.789> system<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> that's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
cross-type autofocus system and that's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.240 
cross-type autofocus system and that's
the<00:01:00.480> multicam<00:01:01.109> 3500<00:01:02.039> version<00:01:02.370> 2<00:01:02.670> versus<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
the multicam 3500 version 2 versus the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.760 
the multicam 3500 version 2 versus the
39.9<00:01:05.250> cross-type<00:01:06.350> multicam<00:01:07.400> 2700<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
39.9 cross-type multicam 2700 in the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.990 
39.9 cross-type multicam 2700 in the
d610<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.010> basically<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.520> they've<00:01:11.670> done<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
d610 so basically what they've done is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.969 
d610 so basically what they've done is
they're<00:01:12.119> giving<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> flagship<00:01:13.170> autofocus

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
they're giving the flagship autofocus

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.570 
they're giving the flagship autofocus
system<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.390> d750<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> be

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
system to the d750 so it's going to be

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
system to the d750 so it's going to be
better<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> 610<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.960> by<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> big<00:01:19.890> enough

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
better than the 610 and by a big enough

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
better than the 610 and by a big enough
margin<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.610> you're<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> notice<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
margin that you're going to notice it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
margin that you're going to notice it
especially<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.650> moving<00:01:23.100> targets<00:01:23.549> sports<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
especially on moving targets sports and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.320 
especially on moving targets sports and
things<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.159> next<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.400> we've<00:01:26.939> got<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
things like that next up we've got a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
things like that next up we've got a
more<00:01:27.780> advanced<00:01:28.259> metering<00:01:28.619> system<00:01:29.040> we've<00:01:29.189> got

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
more advanced metering system we've got

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510 
more advanced metering system we've got
a<00:01:29.400> 90<00:01:29.820> 1000<00:01:30.479> pixel<00:01:30.840> RGB<00:01:31.439> sensor<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.100> metering

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
a 90 1000 pixel RGB sensor for metering

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
a 90 1000 pixel RGB sensor for metering
versus<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.619> 2016<00:01:34.619> pixel<00:01:35.180> sensor<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.049> d610

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
versus the 2016 pixel sensor in the d610

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
versus the 2016 pixel sensor in the d610
so<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.369> expect<00:01:38.759> better<00:01:39.150> more<00:01:39.540> advanced

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so you can expect better more advanced

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.160 
so you can expect better more advanced
metering<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> d750<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.600> third<00:01:42.899> thing

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
metering out of the d750 the third thing

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.350 
metering out of the d750 the third thing
is<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:44.009> looks<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.490> they're<00:01:44.820> basically

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
is it looks like they're basically

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.359 
is it looks like they're basically
saying<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> d750<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> bow

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
saying that the d750 is good for a bow

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.690 
saying that the d750 is good for a bow
to<00:01:47.430> stop<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:48.299> high<00:01:48.869> ISO<00:01:49.350> range<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to stop more high ISO range then the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
to stop more high ISO range then the
d610<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.659> they're<00:01:52.079> comfortable<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.710> saying

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
d610 is they're comfortable and saying

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.620 
d610 is they're comfortable and saying
that<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> range<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.860> 102<00:01:56.119> 12,800<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that the range is 102 12,800 for the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.090 
that the range is 102 12,800 for the
d750<00:01:58.290> whereas<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.920> was<00:01:59.009> only<00:01:59.399> 100<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.479> 6400<00:02:01.200> for

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
d750 whereas it was only 100 to 6400 for

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.850 
d750 whereas it was only 100 to 6400 for
the<00:02:02.399> d610<00:02:04.759> expanded<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.880> 50<00:02:06.500> 1200<00:02:07.500> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the d610 expanded is 50 1200 so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
the d610 expanded is 50 1200 so
interesting<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:09.259> how<00:02:10.259> much<00:02:10.440> better<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
interesting to see how much better it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.380 
interesting to see how much better it
actually<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> d6

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
actually is in the d6

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.120 
actually is in the d6
but<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:12.960> we<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.230> assume<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.920> at

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
but I think we can assume that it at

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.820 
but I think we can assume that it at
least<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.640> somewhat<00:02:15.540> better<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.990> not<00:02:16.380> perhaps

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
least is somewhat better if not perhaps

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
least is somewhat better if not perhaps
maybe<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.340> full-stop<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.569> specs<00:02:18.959> would

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
maybe the full-stop that the specs would

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.600 
maybe the full-stop that the specs would
tend<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> indicate<00:02:20.870> next<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
tend to indicate next up we have the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.630 
tend to indicate next up we have the
fact<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.209> tilting<00:02:24.750> LCD<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.800> built-in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
fact that the tilting LCD is built-in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.260 
fact that the tilting LCD is built-in
now<00:02:26.880> similar<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> what<00:02:27.990> we<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:29.040> D

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
now similar to what we have on the D

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.660 
now similar to what we have on the D
5300<00:02:30.300> there's<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> tilting<00:02:31.410> moveable<00:02:32.010> LCD

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
5300 there's a tilting moveable LCD

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.970 
5300 there's a tilting moveable LCD
vari-angle<00:02:33.090> LCD<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:34.140> I've<00:02:34.290> been<00:02:34.530> saying<00:02:34.800> for

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
vari-angle LCD and I've been saying for

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.070 
vari-angle LCD and I've been saying for
some<00:02:35.160> time<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.300> what<00:02:36.420> Nikon<00:02:36.780> needs

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
some time that this is what Nikon needs

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.460 
some time that this is what Nikon needs
to<00:02:37.350> put<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.980> professional<00:02:38.580> DSLRs<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
to put on the professional DSLRs it is a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.979 
to put on the professional DSLRs it is a
necessity<00:02:41.160> once<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.209> start<00:02:42.480> shooting<00:02:42.840> with

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
necessity once you start shooting with

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.660 
necessity once you start shooting with
it<00:02:43.170> you're<00:02:43.620> not<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.220> want<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.430> camera

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
it you're not going to want a camera

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.820 
it you're not going to want a camera
that<00:02:44.760> doesn't<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.480> kudos<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> Nikon

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that doesn't have it and kudos to Nikon

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.640 
that doesn't have it and kudos to Nikon
for<00:02:47.040> putting<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.239> d750<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
for putting this on the d750 on to a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.300 
for putting this on the d750 on to a
professional<00:02:50.459> DSLR<00:02:51.590> next<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.739> we<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
professional DSLR next up we have the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.540 
professional DSLR next up we have the
fact<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.670> Wi-Fi<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.209> internal<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.860> is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
fact that Wi-Fi is internal so that is

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.449 
fact that Wi-Fi is internal so that is
another<00:02:57.269> excellent<00:02:58.260> point<00:02:58.410> instead<00:02:59.340> of

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
another excellent point instead of

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.270 
another excellent point instead of
having<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.790> use<00:02:59.940> an<00:03:00.090> optional<00:03:00.769> dongle<00:03:01.769> plug<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
having to use an optional dongle plug in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.500 
having to use an optional dongle plug in
USB<00:03:02.459> thing<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:05.220> basically<00:03:05.790> gives<00:03:05.940> us

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
USB thing and that basically gives us

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.880 
USB thing and that basically gives us
the<00:03:07.500> main<00:03:07.800> reasons<00:03:08.370> why<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.480> d750<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.560> better

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the main reasons why the d750 is better

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.880 
the main reasons why the d750 is better
than<00:03:11.160> why<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.550> might<00:03:11.880> want<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.480> more<00:03:12.989> than<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
than why you might want it more than the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.520 
than why you might want it more than the
d610<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:14.700> that's<00:03:14.850> five<00:03:15.180> main<00:03:15.570> reasons<00:03:16.080> there's

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
d610 so that's five main reasons there's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.620 
d610 so that's five main reasons there's
a<00:03:16.590> couple<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.100> small<00:03:17.250> others<00:03:17.820> it's<00:03:18.060> actually

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
a couple of small others it's actually

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.460 
a couple of small others it's actually
slightly<00:03:19.140> less<00:03:20.100> weight<00:03:20.459> than<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.420> d610<00:03:22.079> while

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
slightly less weight than the d610 while

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.580 
slightly less weight than the d610 while
probably<00:03:23.010> being<00:03:23.220> slightly<00:03:23.670> better<00:03:24.030> built<00:03:24.590> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
probably being slightly better built and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.979 
probably being slightly better built and
we<00:03:25.860> also<00:03:26.100> are<00:03:26.610> getting<00:03:26.790> acclaimed<00:03:27.510> twelve

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
we also are getting acclaimed twelve

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.350 
we also are getting acclaimed twelve
hundred<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.320> thirty<00:03:28.620> shots<00:03:29.040> off<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.000> battery

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
hundred and thirty shots off the battery

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.789 
hundred and thirty shots off the battery
versus<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.230> d6<00:03:31.650> tens<00:03:31.920> nine<00:03:32.280> hundred<00:03:32.700> shots

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
versus the d6 tens nine hundred shots

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.740 
versus the d6 tens nine hundred shots
several<00:03:34.799> more<00:03:35.010> smaller<00:03:35.519> points<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.600> are<00:03:36.720> in

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
several more smaller points that are in

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.410 
several more smaller points that are in
favor<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> d750<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> five<00:03:39.060> main

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
favor of the d750 but the five main

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.300 
favor of the d750 but the five main
reasons<00:03:39.450> are<00:03:40.019> those<00:03:40.170> first<00:03:40.500> five<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.769> gave<00:03:41.190> you

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
reasons are those first five I gave you

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.280 
reasons are those first five I gave you
there<00:03:41.549> what<00:03:42.269> do<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.450> guys<00:03:42.570> think<00:03:42.630> are<00:03:43.079> you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
there what do you guys think are you

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.350 
there what do you guys think are you
interested<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.890> 750<00:03:44.489> do<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.000> think<00:03:45.239> it's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
interested in the 750 do you think it's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.509 
interested in the 750 do you think it's
that<00:03:45.420> much<00:03:45.570> better<00:03:45.959> than<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.290> d610<00:03:46.950> do<00:03:47.459> you

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
that much better than the d610 do you

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.970 
that much better than the d610 do you
think<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.690> 700<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:49.530> final

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
think this is the 700 it's final

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.539 
think this is the 700 it's final
replacement<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.700> d700<00:03:51.450> successor<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.950> think

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
replacement the d700 successor I think

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.130 
replacement the d700 successor I think
this<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.760> an<00:03:53.880> excellent<00:03:54.239> camera<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.810> think<00:03:54.870> it's

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
this is an excellent camera I think it's

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.199 
this is an excellent camera I think it's
still<00:03:55.350> missing<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.799> few<00:03:55.980> things<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.400> think<00:03:56.459> Nikon

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
still missing a few things I think Nikon

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.509 
still missing a few things I think Nikon
should<00:03:57.480> have<00:03:57.570> come<00:03:57.690> up<00:03:57.780> with<00:03:57.930> 4k<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.739> there's

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
should have come up with 4k and there's

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.590 
should have come up with 4k and there's
a<00:03:59.610> few<00:03:59.790> other<00:03:59.940> things<00:04:00.209> we<00:04:00.360> should<00:04:00.390> have<00:04:00.570> a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
a few other things we should have a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.660 
a few other things we should have a
touch<00:04:00.959> screen<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.920> things<00:04:02.070> like<00:04:02.220> that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
touch screen on it and things like that

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.270 
touch screen on it and things like that
however<00:04:03.329> it's<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.140> great<00:04:04.410> step<00:04:04.739> up<00:04:04.950> from<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
however it's a great step up from the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.910 
however it's a great step up from the
6/10<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.900> don't<00:04:06.959> think<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.560> would<00:04:07.709> buy<00:04:07.860> the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
6/10 and I don't think I would buy the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.830 
6/10 and I don't think I would buy the
6/10<00:04:08.579> if<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.060> was<00:04:09.239> in<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.510> market<00:04:09.810> for

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
6/10 if I was in the market for
