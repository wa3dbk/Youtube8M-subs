00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.680
 boots of chaos the idea of ​​creating 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.779
 absolutely powerful boots we were 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.580
 already come and when the team in charge 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.040
 de lee worked on the focus 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.720
 mid-level boots we 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.660
 saw the chance to set up 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.789
 a fun collaboration the boot mode 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.430
 chaos has become our very first 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.260
 mode p wants and it was rather fun to 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.300
 to do but unlike the others 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.100
 modes of play it had to be put in place 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 a lot of things for the boots of 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.199
 chaos including creating by hand 15 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.670
 alternative kit not to mention what 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.260
 we abandoned along the way 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.879
 but it was totally worth the cost 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.229
 especially when we could see the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.850
 player reactions the first time 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.220
 that they were facing the ultimate of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.350
 luxury of chaos or that he was attempting a duel 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.210
 against a pebble or malzahar from chaos 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.250
 for the little story the goal of the ko 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.470
 with the highest ratio of wins in 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.000
 five bombs of difficulty were at mu 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.000
 he was not the only one crying 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.299
