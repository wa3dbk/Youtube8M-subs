i'm sorry i'm not using fraps I'm
actually<00:00:20.310> using<00:00:20.640> Camtasia<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.660> record

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
actually using Camtasia so I can record

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.540 
actually using Camtasia so I can record
my<00:00:21.960> whole<00:00:22.230> PC<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.800> show<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.039> guys<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> few

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
my whole PC to show you guys a few

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.900 
my whole PC to show you guys a few
things<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> um<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.410> much<00:00:25.789> what<00:00:26.789> we're

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
things so um pretty much what we're

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
things so um pretty much what we're
going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.650> just<00:00:28.650> go<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> video

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
going to do is just go into the video

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.519 
going to do is just go into the video
section<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.660> smaller<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.500> make

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
section here now the smaller you make

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.319 
section here now the smaller you make
this<00:00:31.859> resolution<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.550> need<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.820> change<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
this resolution you need to change the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.990 
this resolution you need to change the
display<00:00:33.540> mode<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.050> windowed<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.610> smaller

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
display mode to windowed and the smaller

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900 
display mode to windowed and the smaller
that<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.780> resolution<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.309> more<00:00:38.670> frames

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that this resolution is the more frames

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.690 
that this resolution is the more frames
you're<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.300> pull<00:00:39.690> unless<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.070> CPU

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you're gonna pull unless you have a CPU

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
you're gonna pull unless you have a CPU
bottleneck<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.719> into<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.230> second

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
bottleneck I'll go into that in a second

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
bottleneck I'll go into that in a second
so<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> fairly<00:00:45.629> decent<00:00:45.750> screen

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so you see I have a fairly decent screen

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
so you see I have a fairly decent screen
size<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> play<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.550> twelve

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
size here but I like to play in twelve

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.569 
size here but I like to play in twelve
eighty<00:00:47.910> by<00:00:48.000> seven<00:00:48.090> 12<00:00:48.809> 24<00:00:49.200> by<00:00:49.320> 768<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
eighty by seven 12 24 by 768 what you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.100 
eighty by seven 12 24 by 768 what you
play<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
play in is up to you you can make that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
play in is up to you you can make that
fullscreen<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.559> whatever<00:00:52.969> but<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.480> if

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
fullscreen or whatever but just know if

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
fullscreen or whatever but just know if
your<00:00:55.140> graphics<00:00:55.530> card<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.829> pretty<00:00:56.039> crappy<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
your graphics card is pretty crappy the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
your graphics card is pretty crappy the
smaller<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.719> frames<00:00:57.960> you're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
smaller this is the more frames you're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.619 
smaller this is the more frames you're
gonna<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.280> obviously<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> play

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
gonna get so obviously you want to play

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
gonna get so obviously you want to play
on<00:01:00.719> mom<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.350> monitor<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.039> looking<00:01:02.340> for

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
on mom one monitor if you're looking for

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
on mom one monitor if you're looking for
more<00:01:02.609> fps<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.390> shouldn't<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.780> using<00:01:03.899> two

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
more fps and you shouldn't be using two

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.270 
more fps and you shouldn't be using two
monitors<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.890> means<00:01:05.010> your

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
monitors because that means your

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.530 
monitors because that means your
graphics<00:01:05.610> card<00:01:05.820> us<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.119> twice<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.390> hard

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
graphics card us to work twice as hard

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.929 
graphics card us to work twice as hard
so<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.619> want<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> shadows<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.340> off<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
so you want the shadows to be off the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
so you want the shadows to be off the
field<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.270> view<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.439> set<00:01:11.100> an

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
field of view now as you can see set an

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060 
field of view now as you can see set an
fov<00:01:11.640> above<00:01:12.180> 65<00:01:12.780> may<00:01:13.080> result<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.590> lower<00:01:13.770> frame

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
fov above 65 may result in lower frame

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
fov above 65 may result in lower frame
rate<00:01:14.130> frame<00:01:15.000> rate<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.259> because

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
rate frame rate now that's because

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.749 
rate frame rate now that's because
there's<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.220> things<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
there's actually more things on the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.980 
there's actually more things on the
screen<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.180> render<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.869> actually

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
screen to render because you actually

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
screen to render because you actually
have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.290> bigger<00:01:19.530> view<00:01:20.119> around<00:01:21.119> your

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
have a bigger view around your

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.780 
have a bigger view around your
peripherals<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.340> ragdoll<00:01:23.340> doesn't<00:01:23.640> really

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
peripherals so ragdoll doesn't really

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
peripherals so ragdoll doesn't really
make<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> difference<00:01:24.150> any<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:24.900> fine<00:01:25.229> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
make a difference any that's fine so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.149 
make a difference any that's fine so
just<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> advanced<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.630> texture<00:01:27.630> quality

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
just go to advanced now texture quality

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
just go to advanced now texture quality
now<00:01:29.159> black<00:01:29.369> ops<00:01:29.549> 2<00:01:29.759> doesn't<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.450> look

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
now black ops 2 doesn't actually look

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
now black ops 2 doesn't actually look
that<00:01:30.960> bad<00:01:31.200> um<00:01:31.470> even<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> worst

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that bad um even when it's on the worst

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
that bad um even when it's on the worst
setting<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:34.350> graphics<00:01:34.740> card<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.009> actually

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
setting so my graphics card is actually

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
setting so my graphics card is actually
a<00:01:35.340> beast<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> play<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.869> these<00:01:37.020> settings

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a beast but I play on these settings

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
a beast but I play on these settings
because<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.220> feel<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.610> smooth<00:01:38.850> as

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
because I like it to feel as smooth as

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
because I like it to feel as smooth as
possible<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.630> texture<00:01:40.110> quality<00:01:40.610> doesn't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
possible but texture quality doesn't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.770 
possible but texture quality doesn't
actually<00:01:41.820> make<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.299> big<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> difference

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
actually make that big of a difference

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.300 
actually make that big of a difference
to<00:01:43.110> graphics<00:01:43.530> card<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> put<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to graphics card so you can put that

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.940 
to graphics card so you can put that
high<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.710> anti-icing<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
high if you want to now anti-icing and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.520 
high if you want to now anti-icing and
FXAA<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.670> big<00:01:48.299> nose<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.320> low

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
FXAA a big nose if you have low

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
FXAA a big nose if you have low
framerate<00:01:49.829> these<00:01:50.280> must<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.030> off<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:52.020> will

framerate these must be off they will

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.480 
framerate these must be off they will
cripple<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.590> framerate<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
cripple your framerate so they have to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.550 
cripple your framerate so they have to
go<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.329> inclusion<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.899> off

depth of field I prefer to have mine on
um<00:01:57.960> oh<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.009> don't<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> choice<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
um oh you don't have a choice have it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.350 
um oh you don't have a choice have it
low<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.189> sync<00:02:02.189> every<00:02:02.399> frame<00:02:02.640> definitely

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

turn<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.689> off<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> means<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.409> you've<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
turn this off this means if you've got a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
60 Hertz monitor it will lock your frame

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
60 Hertz monitor it will lock your frame
rate<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> 60<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.369> anything<00:02:08.610> higher

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
rate to 60 if you have anything higher

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
rate to 60 if you have anything higher
then<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.569> go<00:02:09.690> higher<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.229> let<00:02:10.560> mine<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
then it will go higher I let mine go to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.420 
then it will go higher I let mine go to
90<00:02:11.760> even<00:02:12.420> though<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.599> only<00:02:12.720> using<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.080> 60

it's<00:02:13.579> monitored<00:02:13.939> because<00:02:14.060> again<00:02:14.599> even<00:02:14.930> though

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
it's monitored because again even though

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's monitored because again even though
I<00:02:15.049> don't<00:02:15.290> actually<00:02:15.409> benefit<00:02:15.980> from<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.250> extra

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
I don't actually benefit from the extra

30<00:02:16.700> frames<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.269> get<00:02:17.510> you've<00:02:18.049> basically

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
30 frames that I get you've basically

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.250 
30 frames that I get you've basically
them<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.969> do<00:02:20.090> with<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.450> mouse<00:02:20.689> and<00:02:21.019> how

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
them it's to do with the mouse and how

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.479 
them it's to do with the mouse and how
well<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.739> mouse<00:02:21.950> tracks

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
well the mouse tracks

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.000 
well the mouse tracks
in-game<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.090> how<00:02:23.209> smooth<00:02:23.659> it<00:02:23.900> will<00:02:24.109> feel<00:02:24.409> at<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
in-game and how smooth it will feel at a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.099 
in-game and how smooth it will feel at a
higher<00:02:25.310> framerate<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.269> game<00:02:26.689> will<00:02:26.900> feel

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
higher framerate the game will feel

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.649 
higher framerate the game will feel
smoother<00:02:27.829> some<00:02:28.700> people<00:02:28.969> feel<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.329> difference

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
smoother some people feel the difference

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.110 
smoother some people feel the difference
some<00:02:29.840> don't<00:02:30.049> I<00:02:30.230> definitely<00:02:31.010> do<00:02:31.189> I<00:02:31.430> can't<00:02:31.909> play

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
some don't I definitely do I can't play

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.119 
some don't I definitely do I can't play
on<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.510> can't<00:02:32.810> play<00:02:32.989> this<00:02:33.139> game<00:02:33.260> anything<00:02:33.920> below

90<00:02:34.400> frames<00:02:34.609> it's<00:02:34.819> unplayable<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.420> me<00:02:35.680> so

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
90 frames it's unplayable to me so

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.479 
90 frames it's unplayable to me so
that's<00:02:36.829> just<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.159> way<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> goes

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
that's just the way it goes

make<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.109> 6mm<00:03:03.790> do<00:03:04.790> they<00:03:04.939> make<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.299> six<00:03:05.629> 970

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
make the 6mm do they make the six 970

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.619 
make the 6mm do they make the six 970
yeah<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:08.209> so

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
yeah I think so

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.750 
yeah I think so
anyway<00:03:09.409> I<00:03:09.560> mean<00:03:09.919> just<00:03:10.069> go<00:03:10.189> to<00:03:10.250> 3d<00:03:10.519> settings

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
anyway I mean just go to 3d settings

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.970 
anyway I mean just go to 3d settings

process<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.329> information<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:39.139> just

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
process that information that's just

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.140 
process that information that's just
come<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.560> bringing<00:03:39.949> the<00:03:40.189> new<00:03:40.370> information<00:03:40.699> so

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
come in bringing the new information so

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.210 
come in bringing the new information so
it's<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.389> constant<00:03:41.989> stream<00:03:42.259> of<00:03:42.319> information<00:03:42.560> as

it's a constant stream of information as

it's a constant stream of information as

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.719 
opposed to how a normal graphics card
would<00:03:45.470> work<00:03:45.650> where<00:03:46.159> it<00:03:46.280> would<00:03:46.370> taking

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
would work where it would taking

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.520 
would work where it would taking

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
information process it get rid of it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.020 
information process it get rid of it
bringing<00:03:48.859> more<00:03:49.069> information<00:03:49.579> so<00:03:49.729> it's<00:03:49.849> much

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
bringing more information so it's much

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.420 
bringing more information so it's much
faster<00:03:50.299> but<00:03:51.290> for<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> crappier<00:03:51.919> card<00:03:52.159> it<00:03:52.280> won't

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
faster but for a crappier card it won't

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.899 
faster but for a crappier card it won't
be<00:03:52.519> it'll<00:03:52.699> handle<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.329> get<00:03:54.259> rid<00:03:54.349> of<00:03:54.409> that<00:03:54.500> um

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
be it'll handle it so get rid of that um

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.969 
be it'll handle it so get rid of that um

that's to do with vsync and that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.349 
that's to do with vsync and that
basically<00:04:01.280> means<00:04:01.459> locking<00:04:01.879> your<00:04:02.150> framerate

this<00:04:37.160> because<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:38.030> build<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.510> have<00:04:38.840> so

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
this because of the build that I have so

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.310 
this because of the build that I have so
set<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.040> like<00:04:40.190> 5%<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.170> system<00:04:42.170> cooling

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320

set that to like 5% and system cooling
policy<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.970> make<00:04:44.120> sure<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.330> this

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
policy you have to make sure that this

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.870 
policy you have to make sure that this
is<00:04:44.750> active<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.500> has<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:46.070> be<00:04:46.160> active<00:04:46.580> because<00:04:46.760> if

is active it has to be active because if
it's<00:04:47.030> passive<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.900> means<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.530> will<00:04:48.650> slow<00:04:49.070> down

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
it's passive it means it will slow down

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.030 
it's passive it means it will slow down

phone is dying huh one thing you guys
should<00:05:29.300> know<00:05:29.570> is<00:05:29.840> that<00:05:29.900> there's<00:05:30.890> two<00:05:31.460> types<00:05:31.730> of

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
should know is that there's two types of

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.960 
should know is that there's two types of
bottleneck<00:05:32.870> there's<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.830> CPU<00:05:34.370> bottleneck<00:05:34.790> and

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
bottleneck there's a CPU bottleneck and

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.570 
bottleneck there's a CPU bottleneck and
a<00:05:35.390> GPU<00:05:35.810> bottleneck<00:05:36.320> now<00:05:36.950> with<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.130> CPU

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
a GPU bottleneck now with a CPU

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.150 
a GPU bottleneck now with a CPU
bottleneck<00:05:38.210> it's<00:05:38.540> actually<00:05:39.290> really<00:05:39.860> annoying

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
bottleneck it's actually really annoying

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.730 
bottleneck it's actually really annoying
because<00:05:40.520> what<00:05:41.330> happens<00:05:41.690> is<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.320> game<00:05:42.530> itself

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
because what happens is the game itself

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.990 
because what happens is the game itself
will<00:05:43.280> run<00:05:43.520> fine<00:05:43.850> um<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:46.490> can<00:05:46.640> tell<00:05:46.880> if

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
will run fine um and you can tell if

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.520 
will run fine um and you can tell if
you've<00:05:47.150> got<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.270> CPU<00:05:47.690> bottleneck<00:05:48.080> because<00:05:48.410> if

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
you've got a CPU bottleneck because if

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.220 
you've got a CPU bottleneck because if
you<00:05:48.620> change<00:05:48.860> these<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:49.760> max<00:05:50.180> settings<00:05:50.660> or<00:05:50.870> if
