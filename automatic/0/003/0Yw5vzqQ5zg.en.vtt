00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.490 
knit one row row one row and now I'm
gonna<00:00:08.099> start<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.460> decreases<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:10.139> because

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
gonna start my decreases now because

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.720 
gonna start my decreases now because
this<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.889> pretty<00:00:11.099> long<00:00:12.530> 90<00:00:13.530> stitches<00:00:14.130> at<00:00:14.280> all

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
this is pretty long 90 stitches at all

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.870 
this is pretty long 90 stitches at all
I<00:00:14.759> want<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> decrease<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:17.039> much<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.580> can

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I want to decrease it as much as I can

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.340 
I want to decrease it as much as I can
I'm<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> ease<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> decrease<00:00:19.050> it

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
I'm going to ease going to decrease it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429 
I'm going to ease going to decrease it
like<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:19.920> make<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.550> top<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.060> hat<00:00:21.439> so

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
like you would make the top of a hat so

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.269 
like you would make the top of a hat so
I'm<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.150> start<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.600> end<00:00:25.140> each<00:00:25.500> row<00:00:26.099> with

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
I'm going to start and end each row with

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.990 
I'm going to start and end each row with
a<00:00:26.310> decrease<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.119> two<00:00:27.269> together<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:29.000> in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
a decrease in it two together and in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
a decrease in it two together and in
between<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.080> counter<00:00:31.439> them<00:00:31.560> out

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
between I just kind of counter them out

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.950 
between I just kind of counter them out
and<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> knit<00:00:32.460> seven<00:00:33.120> when<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> knit

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
and I'm going to knit seven when I knit

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.440 
and I'm going to knit seven when I knit
two<00:00:34.110> together<00:00:34.230> knit<00:00:34.820> seven<00:00:35.820> knit<00:00:36.239> two

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
two together knit seven knit two

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
two together knit seven knit two
together<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> across

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
together and I'm going to do that across

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.459 
together and I'm going to do that across
I<00:00:39.239> end<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:41.040> think<00:00:41.399> six<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> end<00:00:42.469> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I end up with I think six at the end so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.650 
I end up with I think six at the end so
it<00:00:43.559> won't<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.920> quite<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.550> ending<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it won't be quite even ending with a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
it won't be quite even ending with a
knit<00:00:45.899> two<00:00:46.079> together<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> end<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
knit two together at the end but you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
knit two together at the end but you
know<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.360> doesn't<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.840> any<00:00:48.989> difference<00:00:49.530> if

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
know it doesn't make any difference if

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.209 
know it doesn't make any difference if
your<00:00:50.070> distance<00:00:50.700> between<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:52.410> decreases<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
your distance between the decreases is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
your distance between the decreases is
even<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:54.239> when<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.590> sewn

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
even because when this is all sewn

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
even because when this is all sewn
together<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.489> cowl<00:00:56.699> kinds<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> folds<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:58.050> on

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
together the cowl kinds of folds back on

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
together the cowl kinds of folds back on
itself<00:00:58.320> anyway<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> no<00:01:00.840> one's<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
itself anyway so no one's going to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.500 
itself anyway so no one's going to
notice<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.680> they're<00:01:01.859> even<00:01:02.359> equidistant<00:01:03.359> in

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
notice if they're even equidistant in

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.859 
notice if they're even equidistant in
between<00:01:03.840> them<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.309> too<00:01:05.670> fatty<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
between them so I'm not too fatty but I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.140 
between them so I'm not too fatty but I
do<00:01:07.020> want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> small<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.549> quickly<00:01:08.880> as

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
do want to get this small as quickly as

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
do want to get this small as quickly as
I<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.920> only<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> decrease<00:01:11.700> every

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I can I'm only going to decrease every

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
I can I'm only going to decrease every
other<00:01:12.180> row<00:01:12.420> decrease<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> knit<00:01:13.680> rows<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
other row decrease on the knit rows and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.270 
other row decrease on the knit rows and
purl<00:01:14.369> rows<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> decrease<00:01:15.270> again<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> next

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
purl rows and decrease again so next

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
purl rows and decrease again so next
time<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.850> six<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.530> next<00:01:19.530> time

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
time they will be six and next time

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.130 
time they will be six and next time
after<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.610> five<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.360> I'll<00:01:22.020> be

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
after that would be five so I'll be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
after that would be five so I'll be
decreasing<00:01:22.770> hopefully<00:01:23.130> pretty<00:01:23.310> quickly

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
decreasing hopefully pretty quickly

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.710 
decreasing hopefully pretty quickly
we'll<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.540> works<00:01:25.970> okay<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.240> am<00:01:27.450> down

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
we'll see how that works okay I am down

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.219 
we'll see how that works okay I am down
to<00:01:29.570> just<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.930> knit<00:01:31.200> stitch<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:32.220> between<00:01:32.460> my

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
to just one knit stitch in between my

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.039 
to just one knit stitch in between my
decreases<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.390> I've<00:01:36.509> got<00:01:36.540> so

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
decreases here this is what I've got so

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.730 
decreases here this is what I've got so
far<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> record<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.170> when

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
far and just for the record this is when

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.850 
far and just for the record this is when
I<00:01:43.770> placed<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.810> enough<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.619> now

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
I placed it I have enough to do this now

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.010 
I placed it I have enough to do this now
along<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> top<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.270> cowl

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
along the top of this cowl

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
along the top of this cowl
it's<00:01:49.470> probably<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.280> bit<00:01:50.430> longer<00:01:50.729> than<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's probably a little bit longer than I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's probably a little bit longer than I
needed<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.720> probably<00:01:52.200> didn't<00:01:52.560> need<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> full<00:01:53.009> my

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
needed I probably didn't need a full my

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.969 
needed I probably didn't need a full my
deep<00:01:53.399> stitches<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.899> it'll<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
deep stitches but I think it'll be and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.889 
deep stitches but I think it'll be and
it<00:01:56.579> won't<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.030> won't<00:01:57.210> need<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> stretch<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it won't I won't need to stretch it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.750 
it won't I won't need to stretch it
obviously<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> weakest<00:01:58.829> loss

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
obviously the weakest loss

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.210 
obviously the weakest loss
and<00:02:00.200> hopefully<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.230> won't<00:02:01.410> have<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:01.740> gather<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
and hopefully I won't have to gather it

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.700 
and hopefully I won't have to gather it
or<00:02:02.400> do<00:02:02.970> anything<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.330> think<00:02:03.390> it'll<00:02:03.900> sit<00:02:04.290> okay

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
or do anything I think it'll sit okay

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.680 
or do anything I think it'll sit okay
but<00:02:04.980> I<00:02:05.010> probably<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:06.120> have<00:02:06.150> gotten<00:02:06.330> by<00:02:06.510> with

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
but I probably could have gotten by with

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.480 
but I probably could have gotten by with
like<00:02:06.810> 85<00:02:07.230> stitches<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:10.350> keep<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.070> mind<00:02:11.100> that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
like 85 stitches so keep in mind that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.780 
like 85 stitches so keep in mind that
this<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.910> not<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:13.460> really<00:02:14.460> perfect

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
this is not like a really perfect

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.330 
this is not like a really perfect
knitting<00:02:15.450> pattern<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.260> might<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:17.220> in

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
knitting pattern like you might get in

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.930 
knitting pattern like you might get in
our<00:02:17.490> midst<00:02:17.820> or<00:02:18.740> because<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.100> end<00:02:20.370> here<00:02:20.580> I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
our midst or because on this end here I

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.840 
our midst or because on this end here I
just<00:02:21.330> kind<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.600> wing<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.550> there<00:02:23.550> were<00:02:23.670> less

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
just kind of wing it there were less

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.310 
just kind of wing it there were less
stitches<00:02:24.300> before<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.780> end

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
stitches before the end

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.400 
stitches before the end
so<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:26.450> decreasing<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> end<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.380> just

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
so my decreasing on the end and I just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.940 
so my decreasing on the end and I just
kind<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.850> whatever<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.740> skipped<00:02:31.740> one

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
kind of do whatever with it skipped one

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.130 
kind of do whatever with it skipped one
of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.100> decreases<00:02:32.670> here<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.840> extra

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
of the decreases here is to do one extra

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.340 
of the decreases here is to do one extra
stair<00:02:34.500> action<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.960> doesn't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
stair action but it just it doesn't

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.470 
stair action but it just it doesn't
matter<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:37.950> once<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.640> sewn<00:02:38.850> onto<00:02:39.240> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
matter because once it's sewn onto the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.530 
matter because once it's sewn onto the
towel<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.440> towel<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.430> be<00:02:41.580> curved

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
towel the towel is going to be curved

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.650 
towel the towel is going to be curved
anyway<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.710> when<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.070> hangs<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:45.330> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.600> be

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
anyway so when it hangs it's going to be

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.120 
anyway so when it hangs it's going to be
curved<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> back<00:02:48.650> I'll<00:02:49.650> show<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
curved in the back I'll show you the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.040 
curved in the back I'll show you the
next<00:02:50.310> step<00:02:50.460> I'm<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.240> get<00:02:51.360> down<00:02:51.510> what<00:02:52.020> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
next step I'm going to get down what I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.650 
next step I'm going to get down what I
eventually<00:02:52.410> want<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.640> middle<00:02:54.090> strip<00:02:54.510> of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
eventually want is a middle strip of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.410 
eventually want is a middle strip of
light<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.050> think<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.560> seven<00:02:55.980> stitches<00:02:56.420> for

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
light I think that is seven stitches for

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
light I think that is seven stitches for
a<00:02:57.720> handle<00:02:58.260> piece<00:02:58.470> that's<00:02:58.740> gonna<00:02:58.920> flip<00:02:59.250> over<00:03:00.950> so

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
a handle piece that's gonna flip over so

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.530 
a handle piece that's gonna flip over so
we'll<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.580> step-by-step<00:03:03.170> I'm<00:03:04.170> down<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:05.540> two

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
we'll do it step-by-step I'm down to two

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.210 
we'll do it step-by-step I'm down to two
together<00:03:06.690> knit<00:03:07.020> one<00:03:07.260> knit<00:03:07.290> two<00:03:07.500> together<00:03:07.739> all
