do it very slightly the pieces fit
together<00:02:46.660> really<00:02:47.080> nicely<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.790> fact

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
together really nicely just the fact

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.350 
together really nicely just the fact
that<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.239> screws<00:02:49.510> together<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:52.060> nice

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
that it screws together is really nice

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.539

as<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.319> can<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.940> piece<00:02:55.799> fits<00:02:56.799> into<00:02:57.280> a

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
as you can see that piece fits into a

snug piece of rubber at the bottom but

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.350 
snug piece of rubber at the bottom but
it's<00:02:59.890> still<00:03:00.130> kind<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:01.260> wobbly<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.030> put

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
it's still kind of wobbly now you put
