howard<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.070> european<00:01:08.070> blood<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> simple

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
howard on european blood the simple

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.039 
howard on european blood the simple
logic<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.830> place<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.400> bet<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.810> other

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
logic is to place a bet on the other

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.240 
logic is to place a bet on the other
number<00:01:13.320> which<00:01:14.130> hasn't<00:01:14.430> come<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.270> yet<00:01:16.250> now

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
number which hasn't come up yet now

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.980 
number which hasn't come up yet now
remember<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.270> two<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> 5050<00:01:19.229> bet<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.460> 49<00:01:21.420> 48

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
remember it's two of 5050 bet or 49 48

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.520 
remember it's two of 5050 bet or 49 48
but<00:01:26.390> statistically<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:28.110> improbable

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
but statistically it's more improbable

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
but statistically it's more improbable
that<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> would<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.759> same<00:01:31.310> color<00:01:32.900> many

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that you would get the same color many

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.060 
that you would get the same color many
times<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> row<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:37.140> still<00:01:37.409> might<00:01:37.680> lose

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
times in a row so we still might lose

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.149 
times in a row so we still might lose
the<00:01:38.220> neck<00:01:38.369> back<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.420> having<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> same<00:01:40.680> kind

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the neck back but having the same kind

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.569 
the neck back but having the same kind
of<00:01:41.280> color<00:01:41.579> appear<00:01:42.060> again<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.750> again<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:44.220> by

of color appear again and again this by

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780 
of color appear again and again this by
itself<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.460> forty-eight<00:01:47.460> forty-nine

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
itself it's not a forty-eight forty-nine

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.410 
itself it's not a forty-eight forty-nine
percent<00:01:48.060> chance<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> chest<00:01:49.799> x<00:01:50.579> x

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
percent chance this is a chest x x

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
percent chance this is a chest x x
number<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> same<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> same<00:01:53.159> again

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
number to be the same and the same again

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.970 
number to be the same and the same again
and<00:01:53.970> again

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
and again

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.390 
and again
which<00:01:55.670> hopefully<00:01:56.620> not<00:01:57.620> going<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.010> be<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> case

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
which hopefully not going to be the case

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.530 
which hopefully not going to be the case
and<00:01:59.020> here<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:00.110> go<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.530> just<00:02:01.130> made<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:02.150> hero

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
and here we go I just made one hero

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.510 
and here we go I just made one hero
profit<00:02:03.550> simple<00:02:04.550> as<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:05.690> clear<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.110> bad

we move again we place 80 remember don't

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.340 
we move again we place 80 remember don't
panic

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.980 

200<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.490> max<00:03:03.700> let's<00:03:04.180> not<00:03:04.420> try<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.660> let's

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
200 is the max let's not try to let's

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:21.690 
200 is the max let's not try to let's
try<00:03:05.260> not<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.650> go<00:03:05.950> there<00:03:20.130> starting<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.250> fuse<00:03:21.460> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
try not to go there starting to fuse the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.510 
try not to go there starting to fuse the
sweaty<00:03:21.970> hands<00:03:22.270> right<00:03:22.570> now<00:03:26.340> finally<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:29.520> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
sweaty hands right now finally so the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.380 
sweaty hands right now finally so the
idea<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.240> we<00:03:31.660> lost<00:03:31.990> this<00:03:32.260> pact<00:03:33.390> would

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
idea is that if we lost this pact would

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.570 
idea is that if we lost this pact would
have<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.900> place<00:03:35.250> 128<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.890> if<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:39.190> lose<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
have to place 128 and if we lose the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.060 
have to place 128 and if we lose the
hammer<00:03:39.730> 28<00:03:40.150> that's<00:03:41.020> real<00:03:41.500> bad<00:03:42.840> however<00:03:44.070> once

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
hammer 28 that's real bad however once

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.330 
hammer 28 that's real bad however once
again<00:03:45.400> statistically<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.920> unlikely

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
again statistically it's so unlikely

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.200 
again statistically it's so unlikely
let's<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:48.940> there<00:03:49.740> it<00:03:50.740> most<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.490> time<00:03:51.580> you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
let's get there it most of the time you

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.110 
let's get there it most of the time you
win<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.870> don't<00:03:53.080> have<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.500> go<00:03:53.850> even<00:03:54.850> at<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
win and you don't have to go even at the

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.090 
win and you don't have to go even at the
number<00:03:55.450> like<00:03:55.630> 64<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:58.150> campus<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:59.040> by<00:04:00.040> the
