00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.189
 I do not know what rockstar that ross turtle has 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.659

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.810
 that it is not that any check has been 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.459

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.689

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.459

 has happened to the kid more then he has 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.900

 your character play 3 to 4 and subtract in 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.319

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.690
