canal to the orifice level you can
actually<00:01:43.349> take<00:01:43.709> the<00:01:43.859> fat<00:01:44.069> end<00:01:44.099> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> plugger

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
actually take the fat end of the plugger

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
actually take the fat end of the plugger
and<00:01:44.939> cut<00:01:45.450> off<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.840> surplus<00:01:46.289> gutta-percha<00:01:46.529> at

and cut off the surplus gutta-percha at

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
and cut off the surplus gutta-percha at
the<00:01:47.069> orifice<00:01:47.279> level<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.599> you're<00:01:48.719> going

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the orifice level and then you're going

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.569 
the orifice level and then you're going
to<00:01:49.049> condense<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.649> gutta-percha<00:01:49.799> until<00:01:50.459> it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
