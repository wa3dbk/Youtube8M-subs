00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hello everybody this is Caleb I found

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.640 
hello everybody this is Caleb I found
this<00:00:03.060> really<00:00:03.270> cool<00:00:03.510> blog<00:00:03.810> talking<00:00:04.259> about

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
this really cool blog talking about

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.519 
this really cool blog talking about
using<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.160> USB<00:00:05.359> microscope<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.899> zero<00:00:07.230> out<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
using a USB microscope to zero out the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.770 
using a USB microscope to zero out the
XY<00:00:08.160> position<00:00:08.429> at<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.970> beginning<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.510> job

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
XY position at the beginning of a job

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.870 
XY position at the beginning of a job
and<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.559> thought<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> was<00:00:10.980> really<00:00:11.309> awesome<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
and I thought it was really awesome and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.600 
and I thought it was really awesome and
I<00:00:11.969> decided<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.540> had<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.950> set<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> up<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.429> my

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I decided I had to set this up on my

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.269 
I decided I had to set this up on my
shape<00:00:14.849> OCO<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.619> video<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
shape OCO and so this video is going to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.500 
shape OCO and so this video is going to
be<00:00:17.369> talking<00:00:17.820> about<00:00:18.560> making<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.340> mount<00:00:20.609> for

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
be talking about making of the mount for

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.410 
be talking about making of the mount for
the<00:00:21.689> USB<00:00:21.960> microscope<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.100> mount<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:24.029> my

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the USB microscope to mount to on my

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
the USB microscope to mount to on my
shape<00:00:24.630> OCO<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.199> still<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> work<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
shape OCO I still have a lot of work to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.259 
shape OCO I still have a lot of work to
go<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.449> setting<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:27.990> within<00:00:28.289> linuxcnc<00:00:29.269> but

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
go on setting it up within linuxcnc but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.810 
go on setting it up within linuxcnc but
I'm<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.750> excited<00:00:31.050> where<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.980> went<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
I'm really excited where it's went and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.400 
I'm really excited where it's went and
how<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.480> turned<00:00:33.930> out

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
how it turned out

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410 
how it turned out
so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> hope<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.100> enjoy<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> video<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.210> not

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
so I hope you enjoy this video it's not

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
so I hope you enjoy this video it's not
really<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> how-to<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.530> anything<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
really a how-to or anything like that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.459 
really a how-to or anything like that
but<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.910> hope<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:39.660> enjoyable<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
but I hope that it's still enjoyable to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
but I hope that it's still enjoyable to
watch<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.950> maybe<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.059> think

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
watch and maybe will make you think

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.139 
watch and maybe will make you think
about<00:00:42.410> doing<00:00:43.410> something<00:00:43.829> cool<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.819 

so<00:00:48.149> first<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:48.570> I'd<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.930> show<00:00:49.170> off<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so first off I'd like to show off the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.180 
so first off I'd like to show off the
microscope<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> decided<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> buy<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
microscope that I decided to buy it's

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
microscope that I decided to buy it's
basically<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> same<00:00:53.610> microscope<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
basically the same microscope that's in

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.680 
basically the same microscope that's in
the<00:00:54.870> article<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.489> cheaper<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the article but it's cheaper because it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
the article but it's cheaper because it
comes<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.170> different<00:00:58.829> mount<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.340> much

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
comes with a different mount that's much

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
comes with a different mount that's much
cheaper<00:00:59.840> but<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.930> doesn't<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.379> matter

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
cheaper but that doesn't really matter

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
cheaper but that doesn't really matter
to<00:01:01.829> me<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.670> didn't<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to me because I didn't really want to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.880 
to me because I didn't really want to
use<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> mount<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> came<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.409> anyways

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
use the mount that it came with anyways

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.000 
use the mount that it came with anyways
I<00:01:05.010> wanted<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> make<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.700> own<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> aluminum

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
I wanted to make my own out of aluminum

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.609 
I wanted to make my own out of aluminum
so<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.400> basically<00:01:09.080> irrelevant<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so that's basically irrelevant and it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
so that's basically irrelevant and it
was<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.369> cheaper<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.360> anybody's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
was a lot cheaper and if anybody's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
was a lot cheaper and if anybody's
interested<00:01:13.080> I'll<00:01:13.619> leave<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> link<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
interested I'll leave the link in the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660 
interested I'll leave the link in the
description<00:01:15.150> below<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:16.369> knew<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> needed

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
description below I knew that I needed

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
description below I knew that I needed
to<00:01:17.970> choose<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> material<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> mounting

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to choose a material for the mounting

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880 
to choose a material for the mounting
bracket<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.689> durable<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
bracket that was really durable and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.160 
bracket that was really durable and
rigid<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.939> decided<00:01:24.330> aluminum<00:01:24.869> would<00:01:25.020> be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
rigid and I decided aluminum would be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.710 
rigid and I decided aluminum would be
the<00:01:25.350> best<00:01:25.560> option<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.360> would<00:01:27.509> be

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the best option just because it would be

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.260 
the best option just because it would be
much<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.020> durable<00:01:28.560> than<00:01:28.860> Delrin<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.000> some

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
much more durable than Delrin or some

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
much more durable than Delrin or some
other<00:01:30.420> plastic<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.170> something<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
other plastic or something like that and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.929 
other plastic or something like that and
I<00:01:32.880> had<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> available<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> basically<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I had it available to me so basically I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.810 
I had it available to me so basically I
chose<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.509> use<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:36.869> scrap<00:01:37.439> aluminum<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.670> my

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
chose to use some scrap aluminum that my

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.520 
chose to use some scrap aluminum that my
grandfather<00:01:39.240> had<00:01:39.479> kicking<00:01:39.810> around<00:01:40.049> his<00:01:40.229> shop

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
grandfather had kicking around his shop

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.999 
grandfather had kicking around his shop
I<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.820> no<00:01:42.030> idea<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.509> alloy<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I have no idea what alloy it is all I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.630 
I have no idea what alloy it is all I
know<00:01:44.189> from<00:01:44.640> my<00:01:44.729> grandfather<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> was

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
know from my grandfather is that it was

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.630 
know from my grandfather is that it was
some<00:01:47.640> sort<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.960> aviation<00:01:48.960> grade<00:01:49.640> aluminum

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
some sort of aviation grade aluminum

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
some sort of aviation grade aluminum
that<00:01:50.790> he<00:01:50.939> picked<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.329> from<00:01:51.540> his<00:01:51.899> days<00:01:52.110> working

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that he picked up from his days working

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
that he picked up from his days working
at<00:01:52.770> Holley<00:01:53.040> basically<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:55.049> nice

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
at Holley basically this is really nice

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.889 
at Holley basically this is really nice
stuff<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.860> apparently<00:01:56.310> costed<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.479> company

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
stuff it apparently costed that company

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.350 
stuff it apparently costed that company
quite<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> lot<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> money<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.979> purchase<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
quite a lot of money to purchase and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.139 
quite a lot of money to purchase and
this<00:02:00.450> was<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> piece<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.049> came<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
this was a piece that came out of the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.520 
this was a piece that came out of the
tool<00:02:03.149> testing<00:02:04.009> like<00:02:05.210> shop<00:02:06.380> within<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
tool testing like shop within the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.850 
tool testing like shop within the
factory<00:02:07.759> that's<00:02:08.759> why<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.000> has<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> couple<00:02:09.509> like

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
factory that's why it has a couple like

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
factory that's why it has a couple like
threading<00:02:10.860> holes<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.060> was

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
threading holes and it was

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930 
threading holes and it was
they<00:02:13.020> were<00:02:13.080> using<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.620> test<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.520> material

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
they were using it to test the material

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.910 
they were using it to test the material
with<00:02:15.209> some<00:02:15.569> tools<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.260> fixtures<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
with some tools and fixtures and that

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.890 
with some tools and fixtures and that
they<00:02:17.010> were<00:02:17.069> building<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.910> make<00:02:18.180> something<00:02:18.599> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
they were building to make something I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.740 
they were building to make something I
have<00:02:19.319> no<00:02:19.500> idea<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.390> anyway<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.450> that's

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
have no idea but anyway so that's

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.530 
have no idea but anyway so that's
basically<00:02:22.430> what<00:02:23.430> happened<00:02:23.819> here<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.269> just

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
basically what happened here is I just

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.559 
basically what happened here is I just
used<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.110> saw<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> cut<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
used the saw to cut it you know to the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.290 
used the saw to cut it you know to the
basic<00:02:28.110> shape<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> dimensions<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.030> then<00:02:30.209> I'm

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
basic shape and dimensions and then I'm

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.020 
basic shape and dimensions and then I'm
going<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.019> toss<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.890> mill<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.370> finish

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
going to toss it on the mill and finish

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.190 
going to toss it on the mill and finish
it<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:34.970> alright<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.599> on<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.019> mill

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it up alright so here we are on the mill

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.960 
it up alright so here we are on the mill
working<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> piece<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.549> we<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.640> cut

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
working on the piece that we just cut

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.080 
working on the piece that we just cut
out<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:40.200> could<00:02:41.099> have<00:02:41.190> probably<00:02:41.370> done<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:41.849> on

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
out I could have probably done this on

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.000 
out I could have probably done this on
the<00:02:42.390> shape<00:02:42.599> oak<00:02:42.780> oh<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.500> would<00:02:43.709> have<00:02:43.739> took<00:02:43.890> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the shape oak oh it would have took a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.400 
the shape oak oh it would have took a
lot<00:02:44.160> longer<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.269> most<00:02:45.480> part<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
lot longer for the most part and I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
lot longer for the most part and I
really<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.220> didn't<00:02:47.670> want<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.000> mess<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.180> it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
really just didn't want to mess with it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.400 
really just didn't want to mess with it
I<00:02:48.630> also<00:02:48.870> had<00:02:49.200> access<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:50.819> mill<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:52.260> my

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
I also had access to this mill and my

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.559 
I also had access to this mill and my
grandfather<00:02:52.890> wanted<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.489> basically<00:02:53.849> show<00:02:54.390> me

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
grandfather wanted to basically show me

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.890 
grandfather wanted to basically show me
some<00:02:54.989> little<00:02:55.829> tips<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.280> tricks<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.900> he

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
some little tips and tricks that he

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.680 
some little tips and tricks that he
picked<00:02:58.349> up<00:02:58.530> over<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> lifetime<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.819> being<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
picked up over a lifetime of being a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.080 
picked up over a lifetime of being a
machinist<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.860> kind<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.700> took<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
machinist so I kind of took the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.720 
machinist so I kind of took the
opportunity<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.049> learn<00:03:04.200> from<00:03:04.980> him<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.519> he's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
opportunity to learn from him so he's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.280 
opportunity to learn from him so he's
actually<00:03:05.970> operating<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.660> mill<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.140> this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
actually operating the mill and this

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.710 
actually operating the mill and this
shot<00:03:07.560> right<00:03:07.769> here<00:03:08.239> before<00:03:09.239> doing<00:03:09.540> this

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
shot right here before doing this

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.170 
shot right here before doing this
project<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:11.010> really<00:03:11.040> honestly<00:03:11.640> didn't<00:03:12.150> think

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
project I really honestly didn't think

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.390 
project I really honestly didn't think
about<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.840> benefits<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:14.010> hand-operated

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
about the benefits of a hand-operated

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300 
about the benefits of a hand-operated
mill<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.650> biggest<00:03:16.920> things<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.190> I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
mill one of the biggest things that I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.120 
mill one of the biggest things that I
noticed<00:03:17.819> while<00:03:18.090> doing<00:03:18.389> this<00:03:18.540> job<00:03:19.130> was

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
noticed while doing this job was

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.039 
noticed while doing this job was
basically<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.819> speed<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.480> which<00:03:21.720> we<00:03:21.930> could

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
basically the speed in which we could

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.979 
basically the speed in which we could
set<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.799> just<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
set it up and just do it you know it

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.080 
set it up and just do it you know it
wasn't<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.410> very<00:03:25.620> complex<00:03:26.130> job<00:03:26.459> but<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.910> was

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
wasn't a very complex job but if I was

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.789 
wasn't a very complex job but if I was
to<00:03:27.269> do<00:03:27.389> this<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.900> shape<00:03:28.079> OCO<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.620> would

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to do this on the shape OCO it would

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.740 
to do this on the shape OCO it would
have<00:03:28.920> tooken<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.970> know<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> fairly<00:03:30.480> good

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
have tooken you know a fairly good

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.900 
have tooken you know a fairly good
amount<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.109> work<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.500> think<00:03:31.739> about<00:03:31.980> how<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.639> set

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
amount of work to think about how to set

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.780 
amount of work to think about how to set
it<00:03:32.940> up<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.560> software<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.980> how<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.489> get<00:03:35.639> it

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
it up in software and how to get it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.390 
it up in software and how to get it
going<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.329> everything<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.200> yeah<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> really

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
going and everything so yeah I really

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.259 
going and everything so yeah I really
have<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.209> say<00:03:39.329> there's<00:03:39.569> definitely<00:03:39.810> still<00:03:40.799> a

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
have to say there's definitely still a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.120 
have to say there's definitely still a
time<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> place<00:03:42.510> for<00:03:42.750> these<00:03:43.620> manual

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
time and a place for these manual

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.429 
time and a place for these manual
operated<00:03:44.700> tools<00:03:45.420> still

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.319 

this<00:03:51.439> is<00:03:51.590> an<00:03:51.739> excellent<00:03:52.219> example<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:53.150> a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
this is an excellent example of a

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.539 
this is an excellent example of a
conventional<00:03:54.049> cut<00:03:54.379> that<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.859> followed<00:03:55.370> up<00:03:55.519> by

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
conventional cut that is followed up by

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.530 
conventional cut that is followed up by
a<00:03:56.019> very<00:03:57.019> slight<00:03:57.439> climb<00:03:58.129> cut<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.849> give<00:03:59.359> it<00:03:59.450> a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
a very slight climb cut to give it a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.369 
a very slight climb cut to give it a
nice<00:03:59.689> finish<00:04:00.620> right<00:04:01.489> here<00:04:01.700> we're<00:04:02.299> just<00:04:02.629> moving

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
nice finish right here we're just moving

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.080 
nice finish right here we're just moving
through<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.859> material<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.519> conventional

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
through the material in a conventional

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.030 
through the material in a conventional
manner<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:08.030> we're<00:04:08.780> taking<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.140> lot<00:04:09.349> off<00:04:09.590> as<00:04:09.920> you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
manner and we're taking a lot off as you

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.740 
manner and we're taking a lot off as you
can<00:04:10.069> see<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.670> once<00:04:13.879> we<00:04:14.030> get<00:04:14.150> done<00:04:14.450> with<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
can see and once we get done with the

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.589 
can see and once we get done with the
pass<00:04:18.400> we're<00:04:19.400> just<00:04:19.609> gonna<00:04:21.970> ever<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.300> slightly

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
pass we're just gonna ever so slightly

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.480 
pass we're just gonna ever so slightly
move<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.080> bit<00:04:24.229> back<00:04:24.440> into<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.889> material<00:04:25.310> and

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
move the bit back into the material and

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.129 
move the bit back into the material and
then<00:04:26.000> go<00:04:26.240> across<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:27.259> in<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.590> climb<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:32.139> that's

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
then go across it in a climb and that's

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.850 
then go across it in a climb and that's
just<00:04:33.349> going<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.530> give<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.860> better<00:04:33.979> finish

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.860 

so<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.700> is<00:04:41.910> what<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.210> looks<00:04:42.390> like<00:04:42.480> right<00:04:42.810> now

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
so this is what it looks like right now

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.020 
so this is what it looks like right now
you<00:04:43.470> can<00:04:43.590> see<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.920> it's<00:04:44.040> just<00:04:44.130> basically<00:04:44.700> I

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
you can see that it's just basically I

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.570 
you can see that it's just basically I
got<00:04:45.930> some<00:04:46.110> holes<00:04:46.350> drilled<00:04:46.770> in<00:04:46.950> it<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.250> tapped

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
got some holes drilled in it and tapped

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.740 
got some holes drilled in it and tapped
so<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.420> acts<00:04:48.600> as<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.990> bulding<00:04:50.450> point<00:04:51.450> for

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
so that it acts as the bulding point for

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.720 
so that it acts as the bulding point for
these<00:04:51.870> two<00:04:52.140> screws<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.560> hold<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.130> clamps<00:04:53.520> in

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
these two screws that hold the clamps in

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.080 
these two screws that hold the clamps in
place<00:04:53.760> on<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.330> DW<00:04:55.080> 660<00:04:55.730> haven't<00:04:56.730> made<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
place on the DW 660 haven't made the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.640 
place on the DW 660 haven't made the
plant<00:04:57.630> but<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.840> wanted<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.170> show<00:04:58.410> what<00:04:58.530> it

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
plant but I wanted to show what it

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.790 
plant but I wanted to show what it
looked<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:58.860> kind<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.580> before<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.600> have<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.710> all

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
looked like kind of before I have it all

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.080 
looked like kind of before I have it all
done<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:03.290> that's<00:05:04.290> basically<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:04.920> so<00:05:05.310> far<00:05:05.580> this

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
done so that's basically it so far this

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.000 
done so that's basically it so far this
area<00:05:06.510> right<00:05:06.720> down<00:05:06.960> here<00:05:07.230> might<00:05:07.470> actually<00:05:07.710> be

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
area right down here might actually be

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.850 
area right down here might actually be
cut<00:05:08.220> off<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.810> might<00:05:09.990> make<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.410> clamp<00:05:10.650> so

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
cut off and I might make the clamp so

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.370 
cut off and I might make the clamp so
it's<00:05:10.980> up<00:05:11.130> here<00:05:11.520> but<00:05:11.850> right<00:05:12.750> now<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:12.930> didn't<00:05:13.290> know

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
it's up here but right now I didn't know

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.380 
it's up here but right now I didn't know
and<00:05:13.680> we<00:05:13.980> had<00:05:14.100> decided<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.640> test<00:05:16.820> tapping<00:05:17.820> this

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
and we had decided to test tapping this

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.380 
and we had decided to test tapping this
stuff<00:05:18.690> first<00:05:19.050> down<00:05:19.470> here<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.040> so<00:05:20.850> it<00:05:21.210> worked

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
stuff first down here and so it worked

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.780 
stuff first down here and so it worked
out<00:05:21.540> just<00:05:21.600> fine<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.410> I<00:05:23.040> think<00:05:23.370> what's<00:05:23.610> going

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
out just fine and I think what's going

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.080 
out just fine and I think what's going
to<00:05:23.850> actually<00:05:23.910> happen<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:25.520> this<00:05:26.520> might<00:05:26.730> end<00:05:26.970> up

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
to actually happen is this might end up

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.420 
to actually happen is this might end up
being<00:05:27.360> where<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.810> clamp<00:05:28.620> for<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:29.040> camera

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
being where the clamp for the camera

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.090 
being where the clamp for the camera
actually<00:05:29.640> gets<00:05:30.090> mounted<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:30.600> we'll<00:05:31.530> see

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
actually gets mounted so we'll see

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.340 
actually gets mounted so we'll see
in<00:05:32.310> just<00:05:32.910> a<00:05:33.000> couple<00:05:33.030> seconds<00:05:36.200> this<00:05:37.200> is

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
in just a couple seconds this is

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.060 
in just a couple seconds this is
embarrassing

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
embarrassing

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.700 
embarrassing
so<00:05:38.370> apparently<00:05:38.610> all<00:05:39.360> of<00:05:39.660> my<00:05:39.780> video<00:05:40.050> somehow

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
so apparently all of my video somehow

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.480 
so apparently all of my video somehow
got<00:05:41.250> destroyed<00:05:42.260> without<00:05:43.260> me<00:05:43.560> saving<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:44.100> backup

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
got destroyed without me saving a backup

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.420 
got destroyed without me saving a backup
of<00:05:44.670> it<00:05:44.850> so<00:05:45.660> this<00:05:46.290> is<00:05:46.530> literally<00:05:46.920> the<00:05:47.250> only

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
of it so this is literally the only

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.640 
of it so this is literally the only
thing<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:47.880> have<00:05:48.120> of<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.510> making<00:05:48.870> of<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.350> clamp

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
thing I have of the making of the clamp

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.370 
thing I have of the making of the clamp
portion<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.640> this<00:05:51.980> mounting<00:05:52.980> bracket<00:05:54.350> so<00:05:55.350> that

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
portion of this mounting bracket so that

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.250 
portion of this mounting bracket so that
sucks<00:05:56.010> but<00:05:56.760> anyways<00:05:57.420> I<00:05:57.690> guess<00:05:57.750> we'll<00:05:58.050> go<00:05:58.200> to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
sucks but anyways I guess we'll go to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.659 
sucks but anyways I guess we'll go to
the<00:05:58.640> finished<00:05:59.640> product

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.939 

well<00:06:03.270> there<00:06:03.539> it<00:06:03.659> is<00:06:03.750> all<00:06:04.020> mounted<00:06:04.439> up<00:06:04.590> on<00:06:04.830> the

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
well there it is all mounted up on the

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.619 
well there it is all mounted up on the
machine<00:06:05.099> with<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.699> camera<00:06:06.030> mounted<00:06:06.360> in<00:06:06.479> it

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629 
machine with the camera mounted in it

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.529 
machine with the camera mounted in it
and<00:06:07.050> as<00:06:07.379> you<00:06:07.650> can<00:06:07.740> see<00:06:07.949> it's<00:06:08.099> pretty<00:06:08.849> rigid

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
and as you can see it's pretty rigid

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.869 
and as you can see it's pretty rigid
because<00:06:09.689> when<00:06:10.139> I<00:06:10.169> try<00:06:10.500> shaking<00:06:11.310> around<00:06:11.610> the

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
because when I try shaking around the

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.879 
because when I try shaking around the
camera<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.389> whole<00:06:12.419> spindle<00:06:13.349> and<00:06:13.469> everything

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
camera the whole spindle and everything

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.760 
camera the whole spindle and everything
shakes<00:06:14.250> so<00:06:15.210> it's<00:06:15.780> definitely<00:06:16.229> locked<00:06:16.560> in

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
shakes so it's definitely locked in

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.679 
shakes so it's definitely locked in
there<00:06:16.949> really<00:06:17.189> good<00:06:17.370> which<00:06:17.879> is<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.569> know

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
there really good which is you know

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.439 
there really good which is you know
really<00:06:18.719> the<00:06:19.139> intent<00:06:19.500> of<00:06:19.650> making<00:06:20.039> it<00:06:20.189> like<00:06:21.150> this

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
really the intent of making it like this

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.559 
really the intent of making it like this
as<00:06:21.659> you<00:06:22.080> can<00:06:22.259> see<00:06:22.379> the<00:06:22.620> aluminum<00:06:23.039> is<00:06:23.250> nicely

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569

with it it really turned out really nice
oh<00:06:33.979> yeah<00:06:36.379> the<00:06:37.379> next<00:06:37.620> thing<00:06:37.800> is<00:06:37.919> going<00:06:37.979> to<00:06:38.310> be<00:06:38.460> to

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
oh yeah the next thing is going to be to

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.399 
oh yeah the next thing is going to be to
basically<00:06:39.090> get<00:06:39.240> it<00:06:39.360> lined<00:06:39.569> up<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:39.990> X<00:06:40.139> and

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
basically get it lined up in the X and

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.540 
basically get it lined up in the X and
the<00:06:40.469> y<00:06:40.620> planes<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:42.240> will<00:06:42.419> basically<00:06:43.550> allow

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
the y planes that will basically allow

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.909 
the y planes that will basically allow
me<00:06:45.000> to<00:06:45.210> make<00:06:46.110> sure<00:06:46.259> that<00:06:46.439> it's<00:06:46.650> accurate

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
me to make sure that it's accurate

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.519 
me to make sure that it's accurate
within<00:06:47.520> a<00:06:47.729> certain<00:06:47.909> amount<00:06:49.699> when<00:06:50.699> I<00:06:51.139> jog<00:06:52.139> the

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:52.529 
within a certain amount when I jog the

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.779 
within a certain amount when I jog the
the<00:06:53.129> spindle<00:06:53.580> up<00:06:53.759> and<00:06:53.939> down<00:06:54.090> in<00:06:54.419> the<00:06:54.750> Z<00:06:54.960> plane

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
the spindle up and down in the Z plane

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.709 
the spindle up and down in the Z plane
hopefully<00:06:56.789> you<00:06:56.939> enjoyed<00:06:57.240> the<00:06:57.419> video<00:06:57.569> and
