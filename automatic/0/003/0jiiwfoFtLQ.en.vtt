00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 welcome are this new video 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
 tutorial of your android channel sham in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.039
 this video I bring you share these 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 two applications that you see here that are the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.800
 player and the gallery el sony xperia 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.930
 70 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.630
 we started well let's throw a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.970
 look at the album good first of all what 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.579
 first thing you have to do is go to the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.550
 description of the video see the link of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.290
 download either mega or half faith and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 there will come together these two 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.969
 applications ok 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 an apology for my good voice since 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.190
 have downloaded and installed we open by 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.440
 good example with the album example 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.620
 different 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.620
 at daytime 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.539
 in this effect 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.539
 and at the same time 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.070
 although it has a function that for example 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 I want is here today in options 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 I give you hidden 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.490
 the result 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.410
 and so we go here hidden photos but 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.980
 they do not appear at my beginning in the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.980
 precipice 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.170
 we go 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:49.530
 is the walkman player 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:53.130
 I think many of us have known the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.270
 producer has an interface too 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 very elegant pretty 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.229
 here this page good this face of the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.739
 application where we show our 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 different folders and we will appear 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.650
 a list with an interface too 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.349
 minimalist very well achieved 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.080
 the name of our interpreters 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.600
 songs 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.550
 this would be the most 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.000
 it is more recommended to look for music 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.800
 well, here we also have the same 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.560
 that here as here 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.460
 a more realistic way of 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.460
 reproductions 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.880
 if you want with a new one and here if 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.160
 you want to ask question and draped 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.440
 and well that would be all 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.530
 for this video 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.990

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.380

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.600
 or if you liked it also leave it there that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.710
 It helped a lot as you like and 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.710
 going down from disney 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.500
 that was all 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.780
