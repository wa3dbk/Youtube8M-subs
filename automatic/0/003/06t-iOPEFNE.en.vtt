00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
enough it's going to deactivate it and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.240 
enough it's going to deactivate it and
then<00:01:59.630> it's<00:01:59.750> going<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.899> take<00:02:00.110> off<00:02:00.289> on<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.160> you

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250
