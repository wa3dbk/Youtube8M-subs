00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
what the bottle that looks like has a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
what the bottle that looks like has a
small<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.100> nozzle<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.450> quite

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
small little nozzle here and it's quite

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.990 
small little nozzle here and it's quite
big<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.229> many<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.890> 35<00:01:35.369> mil<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.760> I<00:01:35.820> think

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
big how many it's 35 mil and I think

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
big how many it's 35 mil and I think
that's<00:01:36.119> quite<00:01:36.270> standard<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.080> foundation<00:01:37.799> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that's quite standard for foundation so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's quite standard for foundation so
I'll<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.250> put<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.760> my<00:01:38.850> hand<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
I'll just put on the back of my hand and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.460 
I'll just put on the back of my hand and
show<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> guys<00:01:39.510> what<00:01:39.659> looks<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
show you guys what looks like the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.020 
show you guys what looks like the
texture<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> I'd<00:01:41.189> say<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.580> be<00:01:41.729> quite

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
texture of it I'd say would be quite

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.070 
texture of it I'd say would be quite
similar<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.260> very<00:01:44.010> similar<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
similar or it's just very similar to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.450 
similar or it's just very similar to
L'Oreal<00:01:46.080> True<00:01:46.560> Match<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.189> say<00:01:47.310> it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
L'Oreal True Match but I would say it's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.010 
L'Oreal True Match but I would say it's
slightly<00:01:47.820> thicker<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> only

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
slightly thicker that's the only

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
slightly thicker that's the only
difference<00:01:49.110> I've<00:01:49.439> seen<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.920> far<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.369> gonna

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
difference I've seen so far I'm gonna

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
difference I've seen so far I'm gonna
start<00:01:50.729> dotting<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.150> on<00:01:51.270> my<00:01:51.360> face<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.869> think

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
start dotting this on my face I think

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.440 
start dotting this on my face I think
I've<00:01:52.500> decided<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.890> apply<00:01:53.189> both<00:01:53.549> sides<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.210> my

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I've decided to apply both sides with my

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:05.099 
I've decided to apply both sides with my
fingers

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.929 

and<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.590> think<00:02:05.829> it<00:02:05.920> has<00:02:06.039> covered<00:02:06.429> quite<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> lot

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
and I think it has covered quite a lot

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.669 
and I think it has covered quite a lot
I'm<00:02:07.119> not<00:02:07.299> too<00:02:07.479> sure<00:02:07.600> if<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.200> texture

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
I'm not too sure if I like the texture

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.130 
I'm not too sure if I like the texture
of<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.950> amazingly<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.360> usually<00:02:10.720> put<00:02:10.899> two

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
of it amazingly I do usually put two

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.449 
of it amazingly I do usually put two
layers<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.440> foundation<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.340> then

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
layers of foundation on and then

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.699 
layers of foundation on and then
concealer<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.750> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.989> contour<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> bit

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
concealer and a kind of contour a bit

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.130 
concealer and a kind of contour a bit
but<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.819> mean<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.300> does<00:02:16.510> look<00:02:16.690> quite<00:02:16.780> good

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
but I mean it does look quite good

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.809 
but I mean it does look quite good
considering<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.620> use<00:02:17.739> my<00:02:17.920> fingers<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.459> dried

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
considering I use my fingers it dried

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.420 
considering I use my fingers it dried
very<00:02:19.090> quickly<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.709> was<00:02:20.799> me<00:02:20.830> again<00:02:21.400> I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
very quickly so if it was me again I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.369 
very quickly so if it was me again I
would<00:02:21.640> kind<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.879> use<00:02:21.940> my<00:02:22.060> fixed<00:02:22.540> +<00:02:22.780> spray<00:02:23.080> or

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
would kind of use my fixed + spray or

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.110 
would kind of use my fixed + spray or
maybe<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.769> wet<00:02:23.980> Beauty<00:02:24.310> Blender<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.790> kind<00:02:25.030> of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
maybe a wet Beauty Blender to kind of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.509 
maybe a wet Beauty Blender to kind of
like<00:02:25.299> give<00:02:25.599> me<00:02:25.750> some<00:02:26.379> more<00:02:26.560> time<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.099> work<00:02:27.280> with

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
like give me some more time to work with

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.330 
like give me some more time to work with
the<00:02:27.610> foundation<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.299> its<00:02:28.480> s<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.470> has<00:02:29.530> set<00:02:30.010> very

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the foundation for its s it has set very

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.059 
the foundation for its s it has set very
matte

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.860 

so<00:02:38.069> as<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.520> see<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.730> kind<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> had<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.330> pick

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so as you can see I kind of had to pick

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.540 
so as you can see I kind of had to pick
up<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.200> Beautyblender<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.860> use<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.459> blend

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
up a Beautyblender and use that to blend

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.760 
up a Beautyblender and use that to blend
out<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> foundation<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.630> did<00:02:43.260> find<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.620> when

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
out the foundation I did find that when

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.770 
out the foundation I did find that when
I<00:02:43.800> dotted<00:02:44.160> some<00:02:44.490> little<00:02:45.120> bits<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.360> foundation

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
I dotted some little bits of foundation

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.510 
I dotted some little bits of foundation
up<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.590> kind<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.860> already<00:02:47.069> dried<00:02:47.310> out

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
up here they kind of already dried out

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.860 
up here they kind of already dried out
before<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.910> actually<00:02:48.150> had<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.630> time<00:02:48.660> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
before I actually had the time to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.420 
before I actually had the time to
full-on<00:02:49.290> blend<00:02:49.590> them<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.130> couldn't

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
full-on blend them and I couldn't

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.010 
full-on blend them and I couldn't
actually<00:02:50.520> see<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.569> wasn't<00:02:51.780> fully

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
actually see that it wasn't fully

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.390 
actually see that it wasn't fully
blended<00:02:52.319> until<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.590> looked<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:53.070> close<00:02:53.250> with

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
blended until I looked really close with

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.510 
blended until I looked really close with
the<00:02:53.550> mirror<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.540> again<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.650> kind<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.400> this

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
the mirror so again I kind of think this

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 
the mirror so again I kind of think this
foundation<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.330> mattifying<00:02:58.080> as<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.380> can

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
foundation it is mattifying as you can

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.290 
foundation it is mattifying as you can
see<00:02:58.650> my<00:02:58.800> face<00:02:58.980> looks<00:02:59.220> totally<00:02:59.700> matte<00:02:59.850> with<00:03:00.000> no

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
see my face looks totally matte with no

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.370 
see my face looks totally matte with no
powder<00:03:00.540> whatsoever

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
powder whatsoever

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.710 
powder whatsoever
but<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.280> really<00:03:02.790> really<00:03:02.970> hard<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.450> kind<00:03:03.570> of

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
but it's really really hard to kind of

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.060 
but it's really really hard to kind of
blend<00:03:03.930> out<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.440> your<00:03:04.530> fingers<00:03:04.920> because

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
blend out just with your fingers because

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.120 
blend out just with your fingers because
it<00:03:05.280> does<00:03:05.400> dry<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:05.970> quickly<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:07.560> very

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
it does dry so quickly and it's very

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.550 
it does dry so quickly and it's very
much<00:03:08.640> hard<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> work<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:09.750> unless<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.380> have

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
much hard to work with unless you have

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.010 
much hard to work with unless you have
some<00:03:10.800> sort<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.100> fixed<00:03:11.760> puss<00:03:11.940> or<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.450> water<00:03:12.690> on

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
some sort of fixed puss or just water on

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.170 
some sort of fixed puss or just water on
a<00:03:13.140> beauty<00:03:13.500> sponge<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.100> kind<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.550> give<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> that

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
a beauty sponge to kind of give you that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.330 
a beauty sponge to kind of give you that
extra<00:03:15.330> time<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.900> blend<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.920> finished

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
extra time to blend this is the finished

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.670 
extra time to blend this is the finished
face<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> foundation<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.530> put<00:03:19.650> on

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
face with the foundation I just put on

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.979 
face with the foundation I just put on
some<00:03:19.800> concealer<00:03:20.610> then<00:03:20.940> some<00:03:21.480> bronzer

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
some concealer then some bronzer

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.620 
some concealer then some bronzer
highlight<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.890> blush<00:03:23.580> added<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.180> eyes<00:03:24.390> and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
highlight and blush added my eyes and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.020 
highlight and blush added my eyes and
lips<00:03:24.780> obviously<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.370> actually<00:03:26.519> put<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:26.880> no

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
lips obviously but I actually put on no

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.490 
lips obviously but I actually put on no
translucent<00:03:27.600> powder<00:03:27.810> at<00:03:27.989> all

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
translucent powder at all

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.620 
translucent powder at all
I<00:03:28.530> feel<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.310> was<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.640> kind<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.180> drying

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
I feel so it was so kind of drying

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.479 
I feel so it was so kind of drying
however<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.470> did<00:03:31.650> feel<00:03:31.769> as<00:03:31.950> though<00:03:32.070> because<00:03:32.340> it

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
however I did feel as though because it

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.490 
however I did feel as though because it
was<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:32.940> mattifying<00:03:33.630> already<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.380> bit

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
was so mattifying already it was a bit

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.340 
was so mattifying already it was a bit
harder<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.920> kind<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.160> blend<00:03:35.400> out<00:03:35.730> my<00:03:35.790> concealer

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
harder to kind of blend out my concealer

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.630 
harder to kind of blend out my concealer
because<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.440> did<00:03:37.560> kind<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.830> stick<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.519> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
because it did kind of stick to the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.370 
because it did kind of stick to the
foundation<00:03:39.150> rather<00:03:39.330> than<00:03:39.540> enable<00:03:40.080> me<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
foundation rather than enable me to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.990 
foundation rather than enable me to
blend<00:03:40.590> out<00:03:40.829> like<00:03:41.070> with<00:03:41.220> my<00:03:41.340> other<00:03:41.489> foundations

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
blend out like with my other foundations

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.270 
blend out like with my other foundations
that<00:03:42.060> still<00:03:42.390> take<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.750> little<00:03:42.959> while<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.200> set<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
that still take a little while to set so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.160 
that still take a little while to set so
that's<00:03:44.519> probably<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.850> downside<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that's probably a downside to it but I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.600 
that's probably a downside to it but I
have<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.290> say<00:03:46.530> now<00:03:46.799> it's<00:03:47.010> all<00:03:47.130> settled<00:03:47.400> in

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
have to say now it's all settled in

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.220 
have to say now it's all settled in
properly<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.239> does<00:03:48.450> look<00:03:48.630> really<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:49.110> nice

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
properly it does look really really nice

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.990 
properly it does look really really nice
and<00:03:49.290> quite<00:03:49.739> flawless<00:03:49.980> actually<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> have<00:03:50.790> not

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
and quite flawless actually I have not

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.380 
and quite flawless actually I have not
put<00:03:51.150> any<00:03:51.299> concealer<00:03:51.900> on<00:03:52.049> my<00:03:52.620> spots<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.610> all<00:03:53.970> so

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
put any concealer on my spots at all so

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.789 
put any concealer on my spots at all so
let's<00:03:54.540> have<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.720> look<00:03:54.870> quickly<00:03:55.290> how<00:03:55.500> they<00:03:55.650> are

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
let's have a look quickly how they are

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.740 
let's have a look quickly how they are
so<00:03:56.610> as<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.880> can<00:03:56.970> see<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.299> covered<00:03:57.510> them

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
so as you can see it's covered them

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.660 
so as you can see it's covered them
pretty<00:03:58.079> much<00:03:58.200> quite<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.010> lot<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.370> looks<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.579> lot

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
pretty much quite a lot it looks a lot

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.090 
pretty much quite a lot it looks a lot
better<00:03:59.730> in<00:04:00.180> person<00:04:00.660> than<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.140> camera<00:04:01.560> but

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
better in person than on the camera but

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.560 
better in person than on the camera but
I<00:04:02.130> haven't<00:04:02.340> put<00:04:02.670> any<00:04:02.880> concealer<00:04:03.150> there<00:04:03.390> I've

minutes<00:04:16.799> anyway<00:04:17.280> but<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.120> noticed<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.479> little

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
minutes anyway but I noticed a little

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.509 
minutes anyway but I noticed a little
stain<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:19.140> my<00:04:19.320> hand<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.130> actually<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
stain on my hand and it's actually the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.340 
stain on my hand and it's actually the
foundation<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.329> literally<00:04:21.690> will<00:04:21.989> not<00:04:22.169> rub

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
foundation and it literally will not rub

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.980 
foundation and it literally will not rub
off<00:04:22.500> at<00:04:22.710> all<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.400> here<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:24.479> see<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:24.870> is

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
off at all so here you can see this is

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.659 
off at all so here you can see this is
why<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.110> pumped<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.530> on<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.740> hand<00:04:25.979> earlier<00:04:26.400> and

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
why I pumped it on my hand earlier and

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.909 
why I pumped it on my hand earlier and
I'm<00:04:27.419> really<00:04:27.810> trying<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.169> rip<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.410> off<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.560> it

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
I'm really trying to rip it off and it

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.700 
I'm really trying to rip it off and it
is<00:04:29.010> not<00:04:29.340> moving<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.450> slightest<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.530> it's

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
is not moving in the slightest and it's

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.990 
is not moving in the slightest and it's
no<00:04:31.860> wonder<00:04:32.070> it's<00:04:32.280> staying<00:04:32.490> on<00:04:32.640> it's<00:04:32.760> kind<00:04:32.910> of

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
no wonder it's staying on it's kind of

around here it is a tiny bit grease
we'll<00:05:37.260> see<00:05:37.500> how<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.740> goes<00:05:37.770> later<00:05:38.160> on<00:05:38.460> hey<00:05:38.730> guys

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.490 
we'll see how it goes later on hey guys
so<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.240> hope<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.540> lighting<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:39.930> OK<00:05:40.320> it's

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
so I hope the lighting is OK it's

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.600 
so I hope the lighting is OK it's
actually<00:05:40.740> really<00:05:41.010> dark<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.370> I've<00:05:41.460> got<00:05:41.580> a

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
actually really dark and I've got a

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.130 
actually really dark and I've got a
super<00:05:42.000> bright<00:05:42.150> light<00:05:42.390> right<00:05:42.420> in<00:05:42.720> front<00:05:42.900> of<00:05:43.050> me

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
super bright light right in front of me

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.050 
super bright light right in front of me
so<00:05:43.440> if<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.160> think<00:05:44.220> that's<00:05:44.490> really<00:05:44.700> shining

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
so if I think that's really shining

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.540 
so if I think that's really shining
already<00:05:45.450> bright<00:05:45.720> then<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:45.990> do<00:05:46.050> apologise<00:05:46.680> but

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
already bright then I do apologise but

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.880 
already bright then I do apologise but

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
matte for the whole day the positives I

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.050 
matte for the whole day the positives I
would<00:06:22.770> say<00:06:22.890> it<00:06:22.980> does<00:06:23.100> have<00:06:23.250> good<00:06:23.400> coverage<00:06:23.610> I

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
would say it does have good coverage I

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.840 
would say it does have good coverage I
needed<00:06:24.450> two<00:06:24.840> of<00:06:25.170> the<00:06:25.410> coats<00:06:25.890> of<00:06:26.220> it<00:06:26.340> to<00:06:26.550> kind<00:06:26.700> of

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
needed two of the coats of it to kind of

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.150 
needed two of the coats of it to kind of
cover<00:06:27.060> all<00:06:27.150> my<00:06:27.590> imperfections<00:06:28.590> like<00:06:28.680> I<00:06:28.950> said<00:06:29.130> I

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
cover all my imperfections like I said I

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.010 
cover all my imperfections like I said I
didn't<00:06:29.460> put<00:06:29.640> concealer<00:06:29.940> on<00:06:30.090> my<00:06:30.240> spots<00:06:30.840> or

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
didn't put concealer on my spots or

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.630 
didn't put concealer on my spots or
anything<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:31.740> covered<00:06:32.010> them<00:06:32.100> up<00:06:32.220> really

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
anything and it covered them up really

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.800 
anything and it covered them up really
really<00:06:32.790> well<00:06:33.290> it's<00:06:34.290> quite<00:06:34.560> easy<00:06:34.680> to<00:06:34.860> apply

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
really well it's quite easy to apply

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.900 
really well it's quite easy to apply
downside<00:06:36.810> I<00:06:37.260> would<00:06:37.530> say<00:06:37.770> it's<00:06:38.100> too<00:06:38.520> fast

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
downside I would say it's too fast

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.850 
downside I would say it's too fast
drying<00:06:39.300> I<00:06:39.570> mean<00:06:39.750> I've<00:06:39.900> still<00:06:40.200> got<00:06:40.380> that<00:06:40.500> stain

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
drying I mean I've still got that stain

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.830 
drying I mean I've still got that stain
on<00:06:40.890> my<00:06:41.130> hand<00:06:41.370> as<00:06:41.550> you<00:06:41.670> guys<00:06:41.850> can<00:06:42.030> see<00:06:42.090> looks<00:06:42.780> a

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
on my hand as you guys can see looks a

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.940 
on my hand as you guys can see looks a
bit<00:06:42.870> strange<00:06:43.230> but<00:06:43.350> it's<00:06:43.500> definitely<00:06:43.650> the

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
bit strange but it's definitely the

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.160 
bit strange but it's definitely the
foundation<00:06:44.100> and<00:06:44.820> it<00:06:45.330> just<00:06:45.600> stay<00:06:45.780> in<00:06:45.840> my<00:06:45.960> hand

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
foundation and it just stay in my hand

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.630 
foundation and it just stay in my hand
because<00:06:46.290> I'd<00:06:46.560> left<00:06:46.830> it<00:06:46.980> on<00:06:47.070> there<00:06:47.280> when<00:06:47.430> I<00:06:47.490> was

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
because I'd left it on there when I was

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.840 
because I'd left it on there when I was
testing<00:06:48.030> it<00:06:48.120> out<00:06:48.270> so<00:06:49.200> one<00:06:49.950> issue<00:06:50.070> is<00:06:50.370> it<00:06:50.580> dries

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.850 
testing it out so one issue is it dries

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.340 
testing it out so one issue is it dries
super<00:06:51.570> super<00:06:51.930> quickly

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
super super quickly

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.710 
super super quickly
I<00:06:52.440> just<00:06:52.650> didn't<00:06:52.920> blend<00:06:53.190> very<00:06:53.370> well<00:06:53.610> at<00:06:53.910> all<00:06:54.360> and

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
I just didn't blend very well at all and

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.900 
I just didn't blend very well at all and
it<00:06:55.470> kind<00:06:55.740> of<00:06:55.800> was<00:06:55.950> a<00:06:55.980> bit<00:06:56.160> of<00:06:56.250> an<00:06:56.340> issue<00:06:56.460> when<00:06:56.760> I

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
it kind of was a bit of an issue when I

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.750 
it kind of was a bit of an issue when I
did<00:06:57.120> I<00:06:57.330> would<00:06:58.080> definitely<00:06:58.560> use<00:06:58.590> a<00:06:59.010> wet<00:06:59.430> Beauty

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
did I would definitely use a wet Beauty

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.650 
did I would definitely use a wet Beauty
Blender<00:07:00.120> or<00:07:00.330> just

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
Blender or just

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.600 
Blender or just
some<00:07:00.870> fix+<00:07:01.260> in<00:07:01.530> there<00:07:01.680> because<00:07:01.860> it<00:07:02.160> did<00:07:02.370> not

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
some fix+ in there because it did not

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.720 
some fix+ in there because it did not
really<00:07:03.540> work<00:07:04.290> that<00:07:04.530> well<00:07:04.710> with<00:07:04.920> my<00:07:05.130> skin<00:07:05.520> and

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
really work that well with my skin and

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.610 
really work that well with my skin and
it<00:07:06.450> did<00:07:06.600> look<00:07:06.720> slightly<00:07:06.960> better<00:07:07.260> with<00:07:07.500> the

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
it did look slightly better with the

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.810 
it did look slightly better with the
side<00:07:07.800> where<00:07:08.010> I<00:07:08.040> put<00:07:08.250> their<00:07:08.430> benefit

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
side where I put their benefit

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.340 
side where I put their benefit
Porefessional<00:07:09.030> I<00:07:09.570> don't<00:07:09.780> think<00:07:09.930> you<00:07:09.990> can<00:07:10.110> tell

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
Porefessional I don't think you can tell

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.200 
Porefessional I don't think you can tell
that<00:07:10.980> much<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.400> a<00:07:11.460> difference<00:07:11.580> now<00:07:12.000> but

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
that much of a difference now but

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.550 
that much of a difference now but
earlier<00:07:12.510> in<00:07:12.600> the<00:07:12.690> day<00:07:12.870> it<00:07:12.990> did<00:07:13.140> look<00:07:13.290> a<00:07:13.350> lot

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
earlier in the day it did look a lot

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.560 
earlier in the day it did look a lot
better<00:07:13.770> on<00:07:13.890> the<00:07:14.070> side<00:07:14.250> where<00:07:14.400> I<00:07:14.430> had<00:07:14.700> a<00:07:14.940> primer

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
better on the side where I had a primer

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.240 
better on the side where I had a primer
on<00:07:15.780> before<00:07:16.140> hands<00:07:16.440> I<00:07:16.530> definitely<00:07:16.890> prime<00:07:17.070> your

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
on before hands I definitely prime your

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.190 
on before hands I definitely prime your
skin<00:07:17.280> make<00:07:18.090> sure<00:07:18.120> your<00:07:18.360> skin<00:07:18.510> is<00:07:18.570> dry<00:07:18.930> when<00:07:19.170> you

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
skin make sure your skin is dry when you

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.360 
skin make sure your skin is dry when you
apply<00:07:19.440> this<00:07:19.500> or<00:07:19.740> else<00:07:19.860> it'll<00:07:20.010> just<00:07:20.190> stick

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
apply this or else it'll just stick

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.370 
apply this or else it'll just stick
straight<00:07:20.790> to<00:07:21.000> it<00:07:21.180> I<00:07:21.360> would<00:07:21.660> really<00:07:22.080> really

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
straight to it I would really really

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.110 
straight to it I would really really
stay<00:07:22.740> away<00:07:22.770> from<00:07:23.010> this<00:07:23.160> if<00:07:23.340> you<00:07:23.400> have<00:07:23.550> dry<00:07:23.820> skin

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
stay away from this if you have dry skin

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.190 
stay away from this if you have dry skin
it<00:07:24.210> will<00:07:24.300> just<00:07:24.450> get<00:07:24.570> stuck<00:07:24.840> in<00:07:24.990> all<00:07:25.110> the

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
it will just get stuck in all the

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.990 
it will just get stuck in all the
dryness<00:07:25.440> and<00:07:25.830> you<00:07:26.310> won't<00:07:26.490> be<00:07:26.580> able<00:07:26.730> to<00:07:26.790> blend

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
dryness and you won't be able to blend

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.880 
dryness and you won't be able to blend
it<00:07:27.180> at<00:07:27.330> all<00:07:27.540> and<00:07:27.810> it<00:07:27.870> will<00:07:27.930> just<00:07:28.140> end<00:07:28.320> up<00:07:28.440> not

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:28.890 
it at all and it will just end up not

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.650 
it at all and it will just end up not
looking<00:07:29.040> how<00:07:29.550> you<00:07:29.610> want<00:07:29.880> it<00:07:29.940> to<00:07:30.030> look<00:07:30.150> I<00:07:30.510> do

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
looking how you want it to look I do

looking how you want it to look I do
like<00:07:31.050> the<00:07:31.170> packaging<00:07:31.620> of<00:07:31.770> this<00:07:31.980> I<00:07:32.280> think<00:07:32.310> it's

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
like the packaging of this I think it's

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.310 
like the packaging of this I think it's
quite<00:07:32.730> a<00:07:32.820> reasonable<00:07:33.030> price<00:07:33.570> and<00:07:34.020> it<00:07:34.110> does

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
quite a reasonable price and it does

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.290 
quite a reasonable price and it does
last<00:07:34.590> a<00:07:34.770> very<00:07:34.800> very<00:07:35.160> long<00:07:35.280> time<00:07:35.340> so<00:07:35.880> that's<00:07:36.120> my
