00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.280
 this anime can fall into the category of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.780
 anime child or for girls that does not 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.579

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.710
 that in his time he enjoyed a lot 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.110
 popularity that was a very work 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.220

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.250

 They asked me for excuses, lies and tradition 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.580

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.770

 sakura car captor is unanimous of the genre 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.039
 majo jojo adventure and romance based on 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.050
 the homonymous handle created by the famous and 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.019
 prestigious group of mangakas girls 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 known as clan responsible for others 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.180
 manga and animes like magical roger 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 rabbit hole ic angelic léger and we could 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.319
 continue like this for a good while following 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.560
 with the style that practically 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.080
 patented and perfected they offer us 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.970
 a story about magic friendship and 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.280
 increase 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.560
 although that captor cure has one more tone 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.480
 light and tender compared to other 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.070
 Clan works is still a work 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.530
 quite pleasant and with greater 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.540
 possibilities towards the public by such 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.600
 reason there was an anime that 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.200
 would debut in the year of 1998 with great 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.200
 success and acceptance 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.260
 the cure is an elementary school girl who lives 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.200
 with his father and his brother having a 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.940
 happy and normal life a day listen 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.410
 sound from the basement 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.230
 which guide you to a mysterious 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.000
 Book to open it released the same 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.370
 a kind of letters which 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.550
 they end up disappearing immediately 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.950
 later it is approached by kerberos or quero 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.620
 a magical being with the shape of a bear of 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.630
 stuffed toy this informs you that it has released 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.390
 the magical letters of the legendary magician 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.980
 cloud and now they must join forces 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.780
 to recover them 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.020
 otherwise terrible misfortunes 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.910
 can occur in the world throughout 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.470
 your sakura adventure will face 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.209
 several letters which have 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.030
 different powers and differ in their 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.280
 method to capture those will also go 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.250
 adding several allies as well as several 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.470
 rivals the episodes are of a character 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.420
 progressive and show how is that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.610
 priest tries to bring his normal life to 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.260
 same time that fulfills its mission what 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.720
 that triggers most of the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.030
 comic and romantic situations the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.630
 which are of a white character but not 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.550
 boring 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.710
 it may be the case that some 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.570
 brothers of perpetual indignation will 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.460
 scandalize with some situations with 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.070
 characters with a clear diversity 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.530
 sexual which does not hide 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.870
 also it fails to fall explicit the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.850
 who know Clamp know that it is a 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.490
 tradition to walk matching boys 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.960
 cute the adaptation studies 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.690
 matthäus made one of their best 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.760
 works as the design captures the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.800
 essence of clan style but at the same 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.959
 Time looks more dynamic and flashy 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.870
 the characters are beautifully 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.060
 detailed as elements such as their clothes 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.890
 Hairstyles and accessories change in each 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.900
 episode what makes them more 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.420
 interesting and greatly enriches the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.700
 visual element what undoubtedly takes 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.040
 the palms are the visual effects and the 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.380
 use of color being this one of the 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.480
 animes more festive and adorned the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.130
 truth is that it is difficult to find 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.180
 some element that is not careful and 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.550
 detailed 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.280
 the music is purely pop but na 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.800
 cheerful and moved very suitable for this 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.630
 type of productions although at times he sins 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.600
 of being too mellow and some 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.509
 definitely going to give them sakura car 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.639
 Captures consists of 70 episodes 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.560
 divided into two story arcs 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.330
 he also has two movies the last of 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.909
 this being the end of the story 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.699
 this anime is an excellent option for 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.560
 share with your friends and family 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.199
 you can see it with your brothers nephews 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.300
 children or couple without fear that some 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.819
 panties or a dynauric pair of boobies 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.009
 try to steal scene or that some of 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.620
 the characters inevitably ends 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.509
 quartered already know the things that 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.930
 they usually pass in animes in quotation marks 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.669
 mature and that are so fashionable the case 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.849
 is that this is a well-made anime 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:41.460
 entertaining and harmless reason for the 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:46.039
 that simply refuses to go out of style 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.039
 Jerry has spoken to you and I'm not kawaii
