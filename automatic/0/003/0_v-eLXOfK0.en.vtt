00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.810 

the<00:00:17.050> focus<00:00:17.439> here<00:00:17.619> is<00:00:17.680> on<00:00:17.949> joint<00:00:18.250> replacement

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
the focus here is on joint replacement

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.880 
the focus here is on joint replacement
so<00:00:18.970> this<00:00:19.150> unlike<00:00:19.599> other<00:00:19.720> worth<00:00:20.020> pedic<00:00:20.349> offices

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
so this unlike other worth pedic offices

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.040 
so this unlike other worth pedic offices
that's<00:00:21.730> all<00:00:21.910> we<00:00:22.029> think<00:00:22.060> about<00:00:22.359> that's<00:00:22.779> all<00:00:22.900> we
