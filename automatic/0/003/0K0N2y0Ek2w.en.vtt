a chest that I actually missed right
next<00:04:46.539> door<00:04:46.569> leaves<00:04:46.990> pressure<00:04:47.530> pad<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.039> go

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
next door leaves pressure pad so go

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.710 
next door leaves pressure pad so go
ahead<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.430> boat<00:04:48.699> slammed<00:04:48.970> down<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.539> one

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.779 
ahead and boat slammed down on that one
and<00:04:49.900> that'll<00:04:50.530> add<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.710> make<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.129> first<00:04:51.400> light

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
and that'll add to make the first light

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
relax is now active so the second area

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.249 
relax is now active so the second area
is<00:05:11.830> just<00:05:12.400> behind<00:05:12.550> Dave's<00:05:12.969> Shack<00:05:13.360> right<00:05:13.930> over

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
is just behind Dave's Shack right over

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.469 
is just behind Dave's Shack right over
here<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.650> I'll<00:05:15.550> bring<00:05:15.669> up<00:05:15.789> my<00:05:15.849> mat<00:05:16.000> references

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
here and I'll bring up my mat references

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.760 
here and I'll bring up my mat references
for<00:05:16.629> all<00:05:16.690> three<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:16.990> these<00:05:17.139> pressure<00:05:17.469> pads

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
for all three of these pressure pads

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.129 
for all three of these pressure pads
jump<00:05:18.310> down<00:05:18.520> slam<00:05:18.969> on<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.389> that<00:05:19.539> is<00:05:19.659> two<00:05:19.930> of

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
jump down slam on it and that is two of

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.110 
jump down slam on it and that is two of
the<00:05:20.259> lights<00:05:20.469> will<00:05:20.740> be<00:05:20.830> active<00:05:21.219> there<00:05:21.460> so<00:05:21.940> there

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
the lights will be active there so there

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.570 
the lights will be active there so there
is<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.509> map<00:05:22.990> location<00:05:23.500> for<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.800> second<00:05:24.340> area

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
is the map location for the second area

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.600 
is the map location for the second area
and<00:05:24.960> like<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:26.020> said<00:05:26.259> the<00:05:26.500> next<00:05:26.830> area<00:05:27.159> is<00:05:27.340> right

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
and like I said the next area is right

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.260 
and like I said the next area is right
bilateral<00:05:28.330> or<00:05:28.569> mini-bosses<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:29.259> AOF<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:29.919> were

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
bilateral or mini-bosses to AOF so were

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.010 
bilateral or mini-bosses to AOF so were
unfortunately<00:05:31.270> we've<00:05:31.389> already<00:05:31.509> been<00:05:31.750> in<00:05:31.870> this

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
unfortunately we've already been in this

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.110 
unfortunately we've already been in this
whole<00:05:32.590> area<00:05:33.069> and<00:05:33.130> cover<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.550> chest<00:05:33.849> but<00:05:34.090> I

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
whole area and cover the chest but I

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.490 
whole area and cover the chest but I
filed<00:05:34.419> leave<00:05:34.599> this<00:05:34.719> one<00:05:34.900> were<00:05:34.990> actually<00:05:35.050> end

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
filed leave this one were actually end

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.409 
filed leave this one were actually end
as<00:05:35.680> well<00:05:35.830> because<00:05:36.099> it<00:05:36.219> is<00:05:36.310> quite<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.880> real<00:05:37.120> long

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
as well because it is quite a real long

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.550 
as well because it is quite a real long
one<00:05:37.449> and<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:37.960> didn't<00:05:38.169> want<00:05:38.289> to<00:05:38.319> just

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
one and I didn't want to just

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.469 
one and I didn't want to just
incorporate<00:05:38.949> it<00:05:39.370> into<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.699> actual<00:05:40.000> guide<00:05:40.240> I

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
incorporate it into the actual guide I

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.420 
incorporate it into the actual guide I
thought<00:05:41.080> I'd<00:05:41.199> leave<00:05:41.380> it<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.830> very<00:05:42.009> end<00:05:42.219> so

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
thought I'd leave it to the very end so

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.820 
thought I'd leave it to the very end so
there<00:05:42.880> is<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.180> third<00:05:43.479> pressure<00:05:43.930> pad<00:05:44.229> to<00:05:44.620> put

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
there is the third pressure pad to put

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.100 
there is the third pressure pad to put
slam<00:05:45.099> down<00:05:45.340> on<00:05:45.639> right<00:05:46.479> at<00:05:46.569> the<00:05:46.630> very<00:05:46.659> top<00:05:46.960> of

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
slam down on right at the very top of

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.200 
slam down on right at the very top of
the<00:05:47.199> map<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.560> yeah<00:05:48.219> from<00:05:48.490> there<00:05:48.669> you<00:05:48.880> can<00:05:49.029> run

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
the map and yeah from there you can run

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.050 
the map and yeah from there you can run
all<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.599> way<00:05:49.630> back<00:05:49.900> now<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:51.370> Shack<00:05:51.789> and

all the way back now to that Shack and

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.640 
all the way back now to that Shack and
it<00:05:52.180> will<00:05:52.300> be<00:05:52.389> open<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.020> we<00:05:53.169> will<00:05:53.319> have<00:05:53.500> our
