00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.049
 yes dear people welcome 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.490
 to a new edition of the news today 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.519
 there is something interesting again yesterday 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.040
 not so but was like I said 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.790
 two three things while the interesting 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
 could be 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.859
 the one we just drive times based 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.580
 insomnia games that are responsible 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.260
 for ratchet clank or otherwise 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.960
 a little something tells about the new ratchet 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 clank what yes for the playstation 4 comes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 and although it should be the same storyline 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 like the original the first ratchet clank 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 So treat that story is that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 same 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.790
 However, this time there are so small 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.670
 greatest hits moderate aspect of it 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.309
 that means there are the best 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 weapons from all over the ratchet clank 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.070
 play in the psp lager what's cool he is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 because the series is known for that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.710
 she has a lot of crazy weapons like for 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.870
 example, the area is mine 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 My favorite now would be me 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 for example, the disco gear i come up with 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.670
 does not know if she is so hot but there is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.170
 A weapon that disco ball 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.030
 shoots and the opponents to dance 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 bring or of course so ban 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.979
 so now I forgot him he was 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.100
 but always my darling my buddy in 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.630
 and I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.509
 They said that, of course 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.670
 should look stunning about how 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.729
 she said that ratchet clank 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.460
 looks like a pixar animated movie 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.770
 the stop in real time on the playstation 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 4 is it really that blatant? 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.890
 would look like 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.829
 or will that remain to be seen 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.909
 this year the game is coming 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.979
 just as film again as far as I know yes 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.350
 Also this next year was the other day 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.770
 sly racoon movie and how the agent 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.170
 clank yes I think so 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.530
 both at pixel there is one 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.299
 few new news about toy story a lot 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 but only toy story movie come out 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.740
 and although the third actually the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.090
 story perfectly finished i know 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.000
 not if you have seen me then 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.429
 Do not betray too much or so toy 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.649
 story 3 were really cool conclusion 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.490
 for the trilogy and yes now the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.380
 studio boss 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.560
 I think I e mail is announced that 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.340
 toy story four now do not tie on 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.950
 toy story 3 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 because the completed trilogy is 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.080
 but that it's sort of a thing 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.210
 means that is just a romantic 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.120
 Comedy may be between 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.910
 bully and how old he is of course 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.830
 forget or maybe it is 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.050
 Barbie and Ken are back 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.580
 In any case, it should be nothing 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.880
 to do the story but rather something 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.140
 only permanent is his and indeed the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.380
 romantic comedy easy 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.120
 it's not supposed to be that way either 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.010
 interaction between the toys and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.420
 go to the children but just one 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.130
 romantic comedy with toys as 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.870
 So it remains to be seen what will happen 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.640
 but definitely sounds like it 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.670
 interesting so then we have one more 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.130
 news that electronic arts next 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.900
 this has closed the sims city 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.330
 or sims also the resident now 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 decided and supposedly to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.140
 some have received severance 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.010
 be taken over to the other part 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.900
 other studios and I say supposedly 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.990
 because he is of course always the statement 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.540
 from ea itself something already belongs 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.160
 Also, some developers said then rather 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.080
 it's not that cool like that now 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.400
 it is also clear that there are some 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.950
 definitely lose their jobs 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.750
 I honestly do not know why are 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.790
 The last one can not be that good 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.320
 with all the limitations of building 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.240
 and further I do not know exactly 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.130
 now only what I have heard 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.040
 but they are always running 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.290
 Good the marks if you are too 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.810
 continued but the studio is 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.120
 been closed 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.510
 and cool for the people who are not there 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.350
 job took shit is always so then 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.820
 a news for film fans in 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.950
 not me not quotes now 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.709
 such a fan of web stripes, however 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.070
 yes this year is the biggest movie so far 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.620
 of the year 50 shades of gray and so on 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.540
 it is now half a billion mark 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.100
 broken into things sales to the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.760
 funds 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.040
 crash millions cost the whole 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.600
 to meet the production costs 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.930
 and now of course I had part 2 of course 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.520
 and 3 is on the way so far 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.100
 the biggest movie of the year 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.270
 I guess and you probably 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.700
 also in april with avengers two of the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.050
 title also luckily relieved because the 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.720
 mentees ventures or avengers 2 is 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.580
 Of course, everything matters to me 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.980
 I like it I go there too on everyone 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.680
 Go ahead and get me avengers 2 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.110
 move in when now came from the course 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.940
 in the last trailer looks out 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.130
 Of course, everything is cool, I 'm right 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.270
 bode on it even if you are so 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.220
 a I have not such a 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.770
 can think a little 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.870
 As a race man has seen, however, he was 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.230
 Ventures once really liked 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.080
 I would be all over Europe until the 2nd 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.280
 I want my course that clear but 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.650
 Nevertheless, I wanted to mention that 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.980
 because half a billion in sales is 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.780
 pretty strong 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:32.720
 So what else do we have one last news 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.930
 and again as a standard movie 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.510
 namely expendables the row with 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.560
 sylvester stallone of the three films so far 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:49.460
 had only got a tv series and 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.140
 Although supposed to play under the direction of 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.330
 or just to do a script 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:58.730
 Not exactly 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.260
 Okay, that's what the stars did 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.510
 The expendables will be in the movies 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.290
 but it should not appear 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.030
 run under his leadership 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.170
 he remains to be seen, I have to be honest 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.100
 be told 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:15.860
 Although I found the expendables films cool 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:21.110
 however, much more was just going on 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:23.920
 at the last of the ex spd leads him 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.920
 believe experts 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.420
 in the amis so a rating for 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.580
 13-year-old should get and this at 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.650
 an action movie so they have extra 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.850
 pay attention that is not one now 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.650
 rating im getting so for growing 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.590
 which is simply nonsense with so many 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.830
 my opinion that this also from her 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:51.370
 are all old ex sat also made 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.350
 just stay on the shit 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.040
 to say he saw with tv 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.980
 but i will definitely be at 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.780
 may create when it is so far 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.970
 So that's it for today 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.620
 I hope you liked it as always 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.530
 like to feedback to the individual things 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.210

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.800
 Opinion on the respective matters the 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.310
 you are always interested in writing 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.960
 and otherwise thank you 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.470
