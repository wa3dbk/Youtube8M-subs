00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.680
 give 32 bits or 64 bits in this case my 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.660
 64 bit computer 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.430

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.579
 if you see this window, try 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.250
 open it many times so that for that 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.729

 let's give it next 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.560

 32 64 bits or both in this case I 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.170
