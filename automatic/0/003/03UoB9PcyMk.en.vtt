00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
special because it's very diverse right

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.560 
special because it's very diverse right
so<00:00:51.519> it's<00:00:51.640> from<00:00:51.790> around<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.059> world<00:00:52.180> so<00:00:52.390> it's<00:00:52.510> a

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
melting pot and I think that's a
