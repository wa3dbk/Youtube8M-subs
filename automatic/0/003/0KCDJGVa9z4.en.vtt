method methodology there you know you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.050 
method methodology there you know you
have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.110> look<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> history<00:00:59.460> clinical

what happened when did he start feeling
the<00:01:03.480> pain<00:01:04.850> yeah<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.689> those<00:01:06.840> sort<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.140> things

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the pain yeah all those sort of things

the pain yeah all those sort of things
and<00:01:07.590> sort<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.039> from<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.219> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:08.850> bit

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:08.999 
and sort of from that you can get a bit

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:10.880 
and sort of from that you can get a bit
of<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.179> picture<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:09.899> head<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.109> what<00:01:10.229> what's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of a picture in your head of what what's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.319 
of a picture in your head of what what's
happened<00:01:11.219> what's<00:01:11.369> occurred<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.880> structures

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
happened what's occurred what structures

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.139 
happened what's occurred what structures
might<00:01:12.509> be<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> fault<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> bit

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
might be a fault and then you do a bit

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.630 
might be a fault and then you do a bit
of<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.679> at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> movements<00:01:17.399> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of a bit of a look at the movements and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
of a bit of a look at the movements and
test<00:01:17.969> a<00:01:18.060> few<00:01:18.179> other<00:01:18.390> structures<00:01:18.810> ligaments

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
test a few other structures ligaments

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.529 
test a few other structures ligaments
and<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.130> forth<00:01:20.460> them<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> work<00:01:21.390> out

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
and so forth them and we can work out

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.359 
and so forth them and we can work out
from<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.039> need<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.249> do

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
from there what the what we need to do

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.239 
from there what the what we need to do
so<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.359> know<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.630> his<00:01:24.869> case<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.590> he's<00:01:26.009> he

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
so you know in his case you know he's he

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:29.419 
so you know in his case you know he's he
buckyballs<00:01:26.819> he<00:01:27.270> bats<00:01:27.649> he's<00:01:28.649> he's<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
buckyballs he bats he's he's in the

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.489 
buckyballs he bats he's he's in the
dynamic<00:01:29.969> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> field<00:01:30.359> so<00:01:30.569> he<00:01:30.780> could<00:01:31.409> have

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
dynamic in the field so he could have

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:32.899 
dynamic in the field so he could have
hurt<00:01:31.590> his<00:01:31.679> ankle<00:01:31.770> doing<00:01:32.399> any<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.759> those

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
hurt his ankle doing any one of those

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
hurt his ankle doing any one of those
things<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.389> because<00:01:34.139> he's<00:01:34.319> a<00:01:34.679> lot<00:01:34.889> of<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
things but because he's a lot of the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
things but because he's a lot of the
guys<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.429> in<00:01:35.609> heat<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:35.880> moment<00:01:36.210> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
guys actually in heat at the moment they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.889 
guys actually in heat at the moment they
so<00:01:37.460> full<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> adrenaline<00:01:38.700> they're<00:01:39.630> warm

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
so full of adrenaline they're warm

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.440 
so full of adrenaline they're warm
they're<00:01:40.460> they<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.819> recall<00:01:42.090> how

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
they're they don't actually recall how

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.169 
they're they don't actually recall how
they<00:01:42.569> hurt<00:01:42.719> themselves

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
they hurt themselves

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.879 
they hurt themselves
here's<00:01:45.179> was<00:01:45.389> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.600> bit<00:01:45.689> vague<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.740> just

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
here's was a little bit vague so we just

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:48.260 
here's was a little bit vague so we just
sort<00:01:47.069> of<00:01:47.100> worked<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.490> few<00:01:47.729> things<00:01:47.789> which

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
sort of worked on a few things which

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.020 
sort of worked on a few things which
needed<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.749> which<00:01:49.200> were<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.590> bit

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
needed to be which were a little bit

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
needed to be which were a little bit
I<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> use<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.350> word<00:01:52.500> stiff<00:01:52.740> but

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I don't want to use the word stiff but

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.430 
I don't want to use the word stiff but
you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.130> say<00:01:53.310> stiff<00:01:53.580> for<00:01:53.730> example<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.440> just

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
you know say stiff for example and just

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.260 
you know say stiff for example and just
help<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> joints<00:01:56.430> move<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.790> better<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
help the joints move with better and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.470 
help the joints move with better and
reassessed<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.670> theirs<00:01:59.670> painful<00:02:00.120> movement

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
reassessed is theirs painful movement

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.810 
reassessed is theirs painful movement
and<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.170> cleared<00:02:01.410> up<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.830> hopefully<00:02:02.760> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and it's cleared up so hopefully it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.220 
and it's cleared up so hopefully it
doesn't<00:02:02.940> come<00:02:03.120> back<00:02:03.150> but<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.660> know<00:02:03.900> we'll

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
doesn't come back but you know we'll

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.230 
doesn't come back but you know we'll
keep<00:02:04.350> an<00:02:04.500> eye<00:02:04.620> on<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.370> if<00:02:06.120> he

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
keep an eye on it and you know if he

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.820 
keep an eye on it and you know if he
needs<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:06.780> exercises<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.680> but

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
needs to do some exercises for it but

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.370 
needs to do some exercises for it but
it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.880> know<00:02:08.940> keeping<00:02:09.390> these<00:02:09.509> guys<00:02:09.750> on

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
it's a you know keeping these guys on

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.270 
it's a you know keeping these guys on
the<00:02:10.560> park<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:12.350> Formula<00:02:13.350> one<00:02:13.470> cars<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the park it's the Formula one cars you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.500 
the park it's the Formula one cars you
know<00:02:14.370> they<00:02:14.580> need<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> bit<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.300> fine-tuning
