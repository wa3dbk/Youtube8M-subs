went under a lot of persecution a lot of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.000 
went under a lot of persecution a lot of
scrutiny<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.080> think<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.530> point<00:02:12.620> my

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
scrutiny and I think at this point my

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.220 
scrutiny and I think at this point my
career<00:02:13.069> I'm<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.030> want<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.330> stand<00:02:14.510> up<00:02:14.660> for
