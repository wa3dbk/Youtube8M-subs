radicals in fact like research has shown
that<00:00:34.820> they<00:00:35.270> have<00:00:35.480> this<00:00:35.630> chemical<00:00:36.050> inside<00:00:36.500> of

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
that they have this chemical inside of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.700 
that they have this chemical inside of
them<00:00:36.770> call<00:00:37.280> Allegra<00:00:37.760> nose<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:39.200> says<00:00:39.500> that

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
them call Allegra nose and it says that

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.440 
them call Allegra nose and it says that
Elissa<00:00:40.070> nodes<00:00:40.280> are<00:00:40.460> really<00:00:40.760> good<00:00:40.940> against

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
Elissa nodes are really good against

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.650 
Elissa nodes are really good against
preventing<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:42.410> know<00:00:42.590> damaging<00:00:43.490> UV<00:00:43.850> rays<00:00:44.090> and

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
preventing you know damaging UV rays and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.900 
preventing you know damaging UV rays and
they<00:00:45.410> also<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.860> properties<00:00:46.130> in<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.730> light

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
they also have properties in the light

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.880 
they also have properties in the light
genes<00:00:47.180> that<00:00:47.330> are<00:00:47.390> supposed<00:00:47.990> to<00:00:48.080> be<00:00:48.200> good<00:00:48.470> for

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
genes that are supposed to be good for

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.810 
genes that are supposed to be good for
colon<00:00:49.820> cancer<00:00:49.850> as<00:00:50.720> well<00:00:51.590> as<00:00:51.700> reducing<00:00:52.700> your

heart rate you know heart disease and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.970 
heart rate you know heart disease and
they<00:00:56.120> also<00:00:56.330> have<00:00:56.630> really<00:00:56.930> good<00:00:57.260> skin<00:00:57.740> benefits
