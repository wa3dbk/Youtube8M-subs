00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
that my bus is so big and my bottom is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.600 
that my bus is so big and my bottom is
smaller<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> Susu<00:01:44.040> didn't<00:01:44.250> fit<00:01:44.430> me<00:01:44.520> at

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
smaller that the Susu didn't fit me at

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
smaller that the Susu didn't fit me at
the<00:01:44.729> bottom<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.180> had<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.720> pin<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the bottom and I had to like pin it and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.460 
the bottom and I had to like pin it and
tie<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.630> kinds<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.960> things<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.320> it

tie it and do all kinds of things to it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.460 
tie it and do all kinds of things to it
but<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.250> year<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:51.210> order<00:01:52.110> different

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
sizes so I did order different size for
top<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> bottom<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> throughout<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> video
