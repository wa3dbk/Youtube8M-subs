that the more materialistic a takes f4
is<00:00:16.029> is<00:00:16.360> also<00:00:16.570> recommended<00:00:17.020> but<00:00:17.470> I<00:00:17.500> don't<00:00:17.920> think

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
is is also recommended but I don't think

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.019 
is is also recommended but I don't think
it<00:00:18.220> fought<00:00:18.550> is<00:00:18.669> this<00:00:18.849> it<00:00:19.210> was<00:00:19.360> that<00:00:19.509> bad<00:00:21.029> so

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
practical move I fought because it

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.240 
practical move I fought because it
restricting<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.230> scope<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.500> pieces<00:00:30.040> the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
restricting the scope the pieces the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.859 
restricting the scope the pieces the
opponent's<00:00:30.550> pieces<00:00:30.730> more<00:00:31.090> more<00:00:31.450> than<00:00:31.630> them

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
opponent's pieces more more than them

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.190 
opponent's pieces more more than them
the<00:00:32.320> materialistic<00:00:33.040> continuation<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:35.020> if<00:00:35.110> I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
position a pawn up with these two

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.900 
position a pawn up with these two
bishops<00:01:16.810> not<00:01:17.170> being<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:18.190> great<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.790> my

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
bishops not being that that great and my

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.850 
bishops not being that that great and my
knight<00:01:19.090> been<00:01:19.360> quite<00:01:19.600> kind<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.960> good<00:01:20.200> eyeing

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
knight been quite kind of good eyeing

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.990 
knight been quite kind of good eyeing
these<00:01:21.130> weaknesses<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:23.680> plays<00:01:23.860> Bishop<00:01:24.130> C<00:01:24.550> free

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
these weaknesses he plays Bishop C free

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.540 
these weaknesses he plays Bishop C free
and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.560> know<00:01:26.590> he's<00:01:26.770> obviously<00:01:26.980> is<00:01:27.250> offering

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
and you know he's obviously is offering

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.460 
and you know he's obviously is offering
another<00:01:27.700> point<00:01:27.880> but<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.030> think<00:01:28.300> it's<00:01:28.510> it's<00:01:29.380> a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
another point but I think it's it's a

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.170 
another point but I think it's it's a
trap<00:01:29.740> here<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.280> thought<00:01:30.580> maybe<00:01:30.790> Queenie

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
trap here and I thought maybe Queenie

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.750 
trap here and I thought maybe Queenie
for<00:01:31.510> just<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.930> winning<00:01:32.200> material<00:01:32.760> there's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
for just just winning material there's

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.640 
for just just winning material there's
no<00:01:33.850> rush<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.120> win<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.540> me<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.810> I'm<00:01:34.960> I'm<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.200> pawn<00:01:35.440> up

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
no rush to win a me to I'm I'm a pawn up

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.920 
no rush to win a me to I'm I'm a pawn up
so<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.490> centralize<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.060> make<00:01:37.660> sure<00:01:37.780> my

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
so I just centralize and make sure my

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.960 
so I just centralize and make sure my
pieces<00:01:38.140> are<00:01:38.350> protecting<00:01:38.830> each<00:01:38.920> other<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.790> he

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
pieces are protecting each other and he

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.120 
pieces are protecting each other and he
took<00:01:40.150> on<00:01:40.360> g7<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:41.110> thought<00:01:41.350> well<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.710> know<00:01:41.830> he's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
took on g7 I thought well I know he's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.830 
took on g7 I thought well I know he's
weakening<00:01:42.520> my<00:01:42.730> dark<00:01:43.030> squares<00:01:43.360> but<00:01:43.540> he's<00:01:43.690> also

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
weakening my dark squares but he's also

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.780 
weakening my dark squares but he's also
weakening<00:01:44.320> his<00:01:44.500> own<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:45.040> we'll<00:01:45.580> see<00:01:45.760> later

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
weakening his own and we'll see later

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.210 
weakening his own and we'll see later
that<00:01:46.120> d2<00:01:46.750> becomes<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.380> very<00:01:47.620> important<00:01:47.950> entry

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
that d2 becomes a very important entry

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.270 
that d2 becomes a very important entry
point<00:01:48.490> for<00:01:48.700> me<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.750> finish<00:01:49.900> off<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.350> game<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.250> I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
point for me to finish off the game so I

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.150 
point for me to finish off the game so I
just<00:01:51.520> took<00:01:51.640> on<00:01:51.820> g7<00:01:52.270> not<00:01:52.960> minding<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.740> check<00:01:53.980> at

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
just took on g7 not minding the check at

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.140 
just took on g7 not minding the check at
the<00:01:54.250> moment<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:56.170> after<00:01:56.260> rook<00:01:56.530> f2<00:01:56.980> I<00:01:57.220> thought

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
the moment but after rook f2 I thought

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.910 
the moment but after rook f2 I thought
well<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.630> case<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:58.990> check<00:01:59.230> is<00:01:59.440> useful

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
well just in case this check is useful

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.160 
well just in case this check is useful
and<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.550> think<00:02:00.730> I<00:02:00.820> could<00:02:01.270> potentially<00:02:01.570> gobble<00:02:02.110> a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
and I think I could potentially gobble a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.230 
and I think I could potentially gobble a
left<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.500> but<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.680> wanted<00:02:02.980> to<00:02:03.130> extinguish<00:02:03.760> the

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
left for but I wanted to extinguish the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.320 
left for but I wanted to extinguish the
opponent's<00:02:04.930> counter<00:02:05.290> play<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:06.090> he<00:02:07.090> really

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
opponent's counter play and he really

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.240 
opponent's counter play and he really
didn't<00:02:07.570> like<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.870> move<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.379> post-mortem

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
didn't like this move in post-mortem

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.369 
didn't like this move in post-mortem
before<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:10.000> mean<00:02:10.720> he<00:02:10.810> thought<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.080> was<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> good

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
before I mean he thought it was a good

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.339 
before I mean he thought it was a good
move<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.700> only<00:02:12.879> am<00:02:13.120> i<00:02:13.269> stopping<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.109> check

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
move so not only am i stopping the check

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.929 
move so not only am i stopping the check
at<00:02:14.499> the<00:02:14.590> moment<00:02:14.799> but<00:02:14.890> also<00:02:15.069> be<00:02:15.400> free<00:02:15.640> frettin

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
at the moment but also be free frettin

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.700 
at the moment but also be free frettin

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
to squash that Bishop gain control of d1

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the bishop on the first rank where it'll

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.870 
the bishop on the first rank where it'll
be<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> tactical<00:02:21.100> vulnerability<00:02:22.100> he<00:02:22.550> gives<00:02:22.760> up

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
be a tactical vulnerability he gives up

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.460 
be a tactical vulnerability he gives up
the<00:02:23.000> second<00:02:23.420> pawn<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:23.720> desperation<00:02:24.140> now

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
the second pawn in desperation now

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.880 
the second pawn in desperation now
birthing<00:02:25.000> g4<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.480> safely<00:02:26.960> take<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.470> f4<00:02:27.860> I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
birthing g4 so I safely take on f4 I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.610 
birthing g4 so I safely take on f4 I
don't<00:02:28.100> want<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:29.420> f6<00:02:29.870> because<00:02:30.140> you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
don't want to go to to f6 because you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.650 
don't want to go to to f6 because you
know<00:02:30.680> he<00:02:30.830> might<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.010> f5<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.790> someplace<00:02:32.630> I

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
know he might have f5 and someplace I

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.200 
know he might have f5 and someplace I
have<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.110> take<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.430> thought<00:02:34.910> there<00:02:35.150> was

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
have to take now but I thought there was

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.330 
have to take now but I thought there was
nothing<00:02:35.570> here<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:36.080> him<00:02:36.230> now<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.100> I've

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
nothing here for him now that I've

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.800 
nothing here for him now that I've
extinguished<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:37.910> check<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.420> know<00:02:38.450> it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
extinguished that check you know it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.210 
extinguished that check you know it
seems<00:02:39.080> quite<00:02:39.290> kind<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.680> safe

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
seems quite kind of safe

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.990 
seems quite kind of safe
he<00:02:40.730> plays<00:02:40.970> queen<00:02:41.270> f1<00:02:42.430> okay<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.700> know<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
he plays queen f1 okay you know if I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.640 
he plays queen f1 okay you know if I
move<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.360> knight<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.570> know<00:02:44.810> maybe<00:02:44.930> F<00:02:45.200> sevens

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
move the knight you know maybe F sevens

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.620 
move the knight you know maybe F sevens
problem<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.490> thought<00:02:47.210> well<00:02:47.390> I've<00:02:47.450> always

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
problem so I thought well I've always

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.320 
problem so I thought well I've always
got<00:02:47.780> g5<00:02:48.350> f<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:48.890> that's<00:02:49.160> three<00:02:49.400> but<00:02:49.880> first<00:02:50.150> I

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
got g5 f if that's three but first I

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.170 
got g5 f if that's three but first I
slip<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.900> check<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:52.520> he<00:02:52.610> plays<00:02:52.820> rook<00:02:53.000> F

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
slip in this check so he plays rook F

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.350 
slip in this check so he plays rook F
rain<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.660> spin<00:02:54.050> for<00:02:54.290> me<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:55.120> given<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.240> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
rain I spin for me and given that the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.790 
rain I spin for me and given that the
knight<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:56.690> not<00:02:56.840> being<00:02:57.020> attacked<00:02:57.380> anymore

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
knight it's not being attacked anymore

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.260 
knight it's not being attacked anymore
because<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.250> rook<00:02:58.400> spin<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.820> played<00:02:59.060> be

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
because the rook spin and I played be

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.750 
because the rook spin and I played be
free<00:02:59.540> squashing<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.200> Bishop<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:01.250> minding

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
Queen C free check at the moment but

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.390

short<00:03:46.280> from<00:03:46.460> here<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.670> played<00:03:47.180> check<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:49.960> for

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
short from here I played check and for

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.600 
short from here I played check and for
some<00:03:51.080> reason<00:03:51.350> Rivka<00:03:51.680> fought<00:03:51.860> Queen<00:03:52.130> B<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.490> was

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
some reason Rivka fought Queen B to was

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.160 
some reason Rivka fought Queen B to was
strongest<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.330> simply<00:03:53.480> fault<00:03:53.870> Queen

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
strongest but I just simply fault Queen

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.160 
strongest but I just simply fault Queen
d2<00:03:54.560> last<00:03:55.010> night<00:03:55.190> was<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.400> killing<00:03:55.940> move<00:03:56.180> because

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
d2 last night was a killing move because

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.370 
d2 last night was a killing move because
what<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.800> white<00:03:58.040> do<00:03:58.310> against<00:03:58.700> rook<00:03:58.970> e1<00:03:59.270> if<00:04:00.200> he

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
what can white do against rook e1 if he

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.220 
what can white do against rook e1 if he
plays<00:04:00.620> rook<00:04:00.860> F<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:01.310> them<00:04:01.490> rook<00:04:01.700> e1<00:04:01.990> anyway

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
plays rook F to them rook e1 anyway

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.740 
plays rook F to them rook e1 anyway
so<00:04:03.530> if<00:04:03.650> takes<00:04:03.950> then<00:04:04.190> check<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.880> take<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.570> Queen

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
so if takes then check I take the Queen

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.720 
so if takes then check I take the Queen
we<00:04:05.870> check<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.350> take<00:04:06.530> his<00:04:06.620> Bishop<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.160> thought

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
we check and I take his Bishop I thought

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.210 
we check and I take his Bishop I thought
was<00:04:07.820> all<00:04:07.970> over<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:09.110> did<00:04:09.290> he<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.710> he<00:04:09.860> resigned

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
was all over so did he and he resigned

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.730 
was all over so did he and he resigned
here<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.390> it's<00:04:11.540> quite<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.750> crushing<00:04:12.080> win<00:04:12.530> I

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
here so it's quite a crushing win I

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.000 
here so it's quite a crushing win I
don't<00:04:13.250> really<00:04:13.930> it's<00:04:14.930> it's<00:04:15.290> strange<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.920> know

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
don't really it's it's strange you know

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.150 
don't really it's it's strange you know
that<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.760> vacuum<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:17.810> know<00:04:18.049> around<00:04:18.830> White's

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
that the vacuum you know around White's

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.760 
that the vacuum you know around White's
King<00:04:19.760> caused<00:04:20.720> by<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.049> know<00:04:21.350> these<00:04:21.500> these

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
King caused by you know these these

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.400 
King caused by you know these these
exchanges<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.490> pieces<00:04:22.790> just<00:04:23.090> but<00:04:23.810> but<00:04:24.140> both

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
exchanges of pieces just but but both

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.530 
exchanges of pieces just but but both
sides<00:04:24.890> positions<00:04:25.760> are<00:04:25.910> getting<00:04:26.150> weaker<00:04:26.480> and

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
sides positions are getting weaker and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.970 
sides positions are getting weaker and
weaker<00:04:26.630> with<00:04:26.990> all<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.230> exchanges<00:04:27.440> and

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
weaker with all the exchanges and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.850 
weaker with all the exchanges and
there's<00:04:28.580> their<00:04:28.910> square<00:04:29.270> opportunities<00:04:29.960> until

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
there's their square opportunities until

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.559 
there's their square opportunities until
you<00:04:31.010> know<00:04:31.130> even<00:04:31.580> d2<00:04:32.060> becomes

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
you know even d2 becomes

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.719 
you know even d2 becomes
possible<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.949> come<00:04:34.099> to<00:04:34.279> you<00:04:34.399> know<00:04:34.490> when<00:04:34.639> it

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
possible to come to you know when it

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:35.980 
possible to come to you know when it
when<00:04:34.819> you<00:04:34.939> exchange<00:04:35.119> off<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.509> bishop<00:04:35.809> so

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
when you exchange off the bishop so

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.919 
when you exchange off the bishop so
that's<00:04:36.169> some<00:04:37.119> fascinating<00:04:38.119> aspects<00:04:38.659> here<00:04:38.749> how

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:38.929 
that's some fascinating aspects here how

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:41.619 
that's some fascinating aspects here how
both<00:04:39.169> sides<00:04:39.469> are<00:04:40.189> weakening<00:04:40.580> themselves<00:04:41.119> as

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
both sides are weakening themselves as

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.159 
both sides are weakening themselves as
the<00:04:41.869> exchange<00:04:42.559> of<00:04:42.709> pieces<00:04:43.129> but<00:04:43.309> let's<00:04:43.999> go<00:04:44.149> back

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.829 

so<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.469> king's<00:04:48.830> engine<00:04:49.249> in<00:04:49.459> review<00:04:49.849> four<00:04:50.569> pawns

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:50.839 
so a king's engine in review four pawns

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.249 
so a king's engine in review four pawns
attack<00:04:51.819> but<00:04:52.819> I<00:04:52.849> just<00:04:53.360> played<00:04:53.599> this<00:04:53.749> standard

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
attack but I just played this standard

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.679 
attack but I just played this standard
plan<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:55.669> try<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:55.969> transpose<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.629> a

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
plan to try and transpose it to a

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:58.689 
plan to try and transpose it to a
baloney<00:04:57.050> structure<00:04:57.709> so<00:04:58.339> we've<00:04:58.459> got<00:04:58.610> the

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
baloney structure so we've got the

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.540 
baloney structure so we've got the
pressure<00:04:58.939> on<00:04:59.209> the<00:04:59.360> e-file<00:04:59.899> and<00:05:00.459> also<00:05:01.459> the

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
pressure on the e-file and also the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.459 
pressure on the e-file and also the
potential<00:05:01.849> can't<00:05:02.240> play<00:05:02.509> on<00:05:02.719> Queen<00:05:03.139> side

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
potential can't play on Queen side

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.100 
potential can't play on Queen side
because<00:05:03.740> I've<00:05:03.830> got<00:05:03.979> this<00:05:04.240> poor<00:05:05.240> majority<00:05:05.869> here

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
because I've got this poor majority here

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.179 
because I've got this poor majority here
and<00:05:06.289> you're<00:05:06.379> supposed<00:05:06.589> to<00:05:06.740> use<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:07.009> poor

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
and you're supposed to use the poor

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:08.679 
and you're supposed to use the poor
majority<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:07.729> Queen<00:05:07.939> side<00:05:07.969> as<00:05:08.240> well<00:05:08.449> in

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
majority on the Queen side as well in

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.749 
majority on the Queen side as well in
exchange<00:05:09.229> potentially<00:05:09.949> being<00:05:10.159> swamped<00:05:10.490> in

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
exchange potentially being swamped in

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.929 
exchange potentially being swamped in
the<00:05:10.849> center<00:05:11.300> so<00:05:12.139> Queen<00:05:12.469> a5<00:05:13.069> bit<00:05:13.789> of<00:05:13.879> a

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:13.939 
the center so Queen a5 bit of a

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.760 
the center so Queen a5 bit of a
provocative<00:05:14.479> move<00:05:14.719> but<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.020> had<00:05:15.169> this<00:05:15.319> idea

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
provocative move but it had this idea

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.159 
provocative move but it had this idea
that<00:05:16.039> some<00:05:16.339> if<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.969> does<00:05:17.119> provoke<00:05:17.479> King<00:05:17.719> H<00:05:17.899> one

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
that some if it does provoke King H one

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.769 
that some if it does provoke King H one
it<00:05:18.740> can<00:05:18.919> slip<00:05:19.189> back<00:05:19.459> to<00:05:19.490> c7<00:05:20.029> which<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.419> kind<00:05:20.659> of

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
it can slip back to c7 which is kind of

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.619 
it can slip back to c7 which is kind of
useful<00:05:21.020> strategically<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.610> prevent<00:05:22.939> ePHI<00:05:23.419> for

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
useful strategically to prevent ePHI for

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.869 
useful strategically to prevent ePHI for
white<00:05:23.719> sports<00:05:24.050> c4<00:05:24.649> so<00:05:25.309> I'm<00:05:25.399> trying<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.699> use

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
white sports c4 so I'm trying to use

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.389 
white sports c4 so I'm trying to use
this<00:05:26.059> Queen<00:05:26.330> side<00:05:26.539> palm<00:05:26.809> writing<00:05:27.379> but<00:05:27.919> I<00:05:28.009> do<00:05:28.069> so

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:28.399 
this Queen side palm writing but I do so

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.879 
this Queen side palm writing but I do so
with<00:05:28.550> this<00:05:28.639> pawn<00:05:28.909> tank<00:05:29.209> which<00:05:29.619> for<00:05:30.619> me<00:05:30.740> the

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
with this pawn tank which for me the

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.769 
with this pawn tank which for me the
verdict<00:05:31.279> is<00:05:31.459> out<00:05:31.610> at<00:05:31.879> the<00:05:31.939> moment<00:05:31.999> it's<00:05:32.360> not<00:05:32.539> so

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
verdict is out at the moment it's not so

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.989 
verdict is out at the moment it's not so
clear<00:05:32.959> theoretically<00:05:33.709> if<00:05:34.009> it's<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.610> great<00:05:34.759> move

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:34.999 
clear theoretically if it's a great move

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:36.670 
clear theoretically if it's a great move
on<00:05:35.179> art<00:05:35.360> but<00:05:35.779> in<00:05:35.899> practice<00:05:36.349> it<00:05:36.559> was<00:05:36.619> a

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
on art but in practice it was a

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.070 
on art but in practice it was a
dangerous<00:05:36.949> move<00:05:37.369> which<00:05:37.610> put<00:05:38.569> the<00:05:38.689> opponent

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
dangerous move which put the opponent

because if queenly to immediately you

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.439 
because if queenly to immediately you
know<00:06:47.960> maybe<00:06:48.370> you<00:06:49.370> know<00:06:49.460> rook<00:06:49.669> have<00:06:49.850> 2<00:06:50.120> and<00:06:50.360> then

know maybe you know rook have 2 and then

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.689 
know maybe you know rook have 2 and then
rookie<00:06:50.900> ones<00:06:51.110> not<00:06:51.350> not<00:06:52.009> possible<00:06:52.460> because<00:06:52.580> he

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 
rookie ones not not possible because he

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.879 
rookie ones not not possible because he
could<00:06:52.970> just<00:06:53.120> take<00:06:53.300> my<00:06:53.449> queen<00:06:53.690> and<00:06:53.840> that<00:06:54.199> rook

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889
