 arctic seabirds facing the 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.130
 climate change global warming 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 can affect in very different ways 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 the various animal species a new 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.660
 study provides revealing data about 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.230
 how are they reacting to the warming 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.809
 global the marine numbers that with their 150 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.970
 grams of weight are among the birds 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.129
 smaller marinas and that for its 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.470
 population between 40 and 80 million 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.960
 individuals are among the species of 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.070
 most common seabirds in the Atlantic 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.380
 north 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.590
 they are common on the rocky shores of 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.970
 or in landia and spielberg in one of the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.790
 islands of the Norwegian archipelago of 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.560
 svalbard 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.200
 to feed themselves and their 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.600
 chicks the adult birds of this type 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.820
 they are mainly dedicated to look for small 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.690
 crustaceans of the plankton called 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.720
 copepods catching up to 65,000 of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.580
 these organisms every day the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 seafarers search for areas with 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.710
 cold currents and avoid waters 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.540
 tempered these birds have a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 magnificent pantry in the icy waters 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.030
 that flow from the arctic ocean to the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.940
 south across the Strait of the Frank 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.680
 between greenland and spears come since 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 those waters are the home of a kind 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 of arctic cope 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.450
 of large size the hyperborean ca lanús 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.630
 which is very rich in fat another kind of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.000
 copepods from finnmark and cus lives in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.650
 more temperate waters but it 's smaller 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.650
 and it provides less energy to those 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.050
 birds because of their specialized diet 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.330
 and its high consumption of food 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.070
 Elmer marine ass is a reliable indicator 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.360
 to evaluate the impact of the change 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.060
 climatic in this region 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.400
 an international team led by 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.550
 david green and diet center for 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.450
 functional and evolutionary ecology 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.200
 dependent on the French national center 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.750
 for scientific research cn rs 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 has shown that the marine nerves 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.740
 are adapting their behavior 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.200
 fishing to the warming of waters 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.990
 superficial ones that are registered in sea of 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.840
 greenland 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.760
 that adaptation is to modify your 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 diet and prolong the duration of their 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.460
 trips in the sea in search of food 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.780
 they travel further and further 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.630
 to feed in areas where you can find 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.070
 food is easier so far 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.840
 mere seafarers have managed 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.000
 pretty good to adapt to the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.940
 effects of water heating 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.160
 superficial in the sea ​​of ​​greenland 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.780
 however it seems that these birds have 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.380
 reached and the limits of their 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.570
 physiological and behavioral abilities 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.610
 a more intense heating could by 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.890
 so cause its decline as 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.690
 species as well as a very disturbance 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.750
 important in marine ecosystems 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.400
 of the arctic altar 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.690
