00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
not that long ago I wrote an article

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.390 
not that long ago I wrote an article
about<00:00:07.689> six<00:00:08.139> months<00:00:08.410> ago<00:00:08.500> so<00:00:08.620> guess<00:00:09.160> a<00:00:09.190> little

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
about six months ago so guess a little

about six months ago so guess a little
while<00:00:09.639> ago<00:00:09.760> I<00:00:10.030> wrote<00:00:10.719> an<00:00:10.840> article<00:00:10.929> about<00:00:11.349> the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
while ago I wrote an article about the

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.260 
while ago I wrote an article about the
Dodge<00:00:12.780> Challenger<00:00:13.780> lineup<00:00:14.650> and<00:00:14.920> I<00:00:15.910> talked

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
Dodge Challenger lineup and I talked

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.339 
Dodge Challenger lineup and I talked
about<00:00:16.419> how<00:00:17.020> after<00:00:17.439> I<00:00:18.009> drove<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:19.419> Hellcat<00:00:20.140> all

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
about how after I drove the Hellcat all

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.280 
about how after I drove the Hellcat all
the<00:00:20.470> way<00:00:20.560> down<00:00:20.739> to<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.009> SXT<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.759> entire<00:00:22.300> 2015

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
the way down to the SXT the entire 2015

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.519 
the way down to the SXT the entire 2015
lineup<00:00:23.680> that<00:00:24.579> as<00:00:24.939> far<00:00:25.210> as<00:00:25.239> Road<00:00:25.689> cars<00:00:26.020> go<00:00:26.290> I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
lineup that as far as Road cars go I

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.170 
lineup that as far as Road cars go I
would<00:00:26.860> probably<00:00:27.040> just<00:00:27.220> get<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> Essex<00:00:27.880> teens

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
would probably just get the Essex teens

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.100 
would probably just get the Essex teens
just<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.200> v6<00:00:29.759> doesn't<00:00:30.759> have<00:00:30.969> quite<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.540> power

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
just the v6 doesn't have quite the power

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.130 
just the v6 doesn't have quite the power
of<00:00:33.010> say<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:34.120> v8<00:00:35.019> engines<00:00:35.829> but<00:00:36.550> on<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.329> road<00:00:37.629> as

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
of say the v8 engines but on the road as

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.380 
of say the v8 engines but on the road as
just<00:00:38.559> a<00:00:38.679> road<00:00:38.890> car<00:00:39.749> it's<00:00:40.749> probably<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.969> best

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
just a road car it's probably the best

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.250 
just a road car it's probably the best
of<00:00:43.960> all<00:00:44.499> worlds<00:00:45.249> so<00:00:46.030> here<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.300> am<00:00:46.449> this<00:00:47.079> is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
of all worlds so here I am this is

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.040 
of all worlds so here I am this is
actually<00:00:47.559> a<00:00:47.589> 2014<00:00:48.249> not<00:00:48.399> a<00:00:48.429> 2015<00:00:49.030> but<00:00:49.539> it's<00:00:49.839> a

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
actually a 2014 not a 2015 but it's a

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.660 
actually a 2014 not a 2015 but it's a
Dodge<00:00:50.739> Challenger<00:00:51.390> SXT<00:00:52.409> plus<00:00:53.429> so<00:00:54.429> with<00:00:54.579> the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
Dodge Challenger SXT plus so with the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.610 
Dodge Challenger SXT plus so with the
plus<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:54.999> get<00:00:55.089> a<00:00:55.149> couple<00:00:55.569> little<00:00:55.870> options<00:00:56.350> and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
plus you get a couple little options and

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.349 
plus you get a couple little options and
this<00:00:56.679> has<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.069> performance<00:00:57.399> options<00:00:58.210> and

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
this has the performance options and

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.799 
this has the performance options and
such<00:00:58.539> so<00:00:58.749> you<00:00:58.809> get<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.170> paddle<00:00:59.980> shifters<00:01:00.519> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
such so you get the paddle shifters and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.430 
such so you get the paddle shifters and
sport<00:01:01.809> mode<00:01:02.109> it's<00:01:02.859> got<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.280> v6<00:01:03.819> engine<00:01:04.720> which

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
sport mode it's got the v6 engine which

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.650 
sport mode it's got the v6 engine which
produces<00:01:05.979> 305<00:01:06.610> horsepower<00:01:06.820> not<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:07.510> long

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
produces 305 horsepower not that long

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.050 
produces 305 horsepower not that long
ago<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:07.870> was<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.110> lot<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.860> only<00:01:08.980> downside<00:01:09.820> is

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
ago that was a lot the only downside is

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.570 
ago that was a lot the only downside is
this<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.360> heavy<00:01:10.660> cards<00:01:11.280> getting<00:01:12.280> close<00:01:12.460> to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
this is a heavy cards getting close to

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.080 
this is a heavy cards getting close to
4,000<00:01:13.090> pounds<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:15.250> know<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.580> takes<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.940> lot

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
4,000 pounds so you know it takes a lot

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.640 
4,000 pounds so you know it takes a lot
of<00:01:16.120> power<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.780> get<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.560> all

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
of power to get that all

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.620 
of power to get that all
moving<00:01:19.160> quickly<00:01:20.380> but<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:21.890> not<00:01:22.040> slow<00:01:22.610> per<00:01:23.360> se

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
moving quickly but it's not slow per se

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.440 
moving quickly but it's not slow per se
it's<00:01:24.350> just<00:01:24.590> not<00:01:24.770> urn<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.640> shaking<00:01:26.030> li<00:01:26.150> fast

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it's just not urn is shaking li fast

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.900 
it's just not urn is shaking li fast
it's<00:01:26.900> zero<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.620> sixty<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:27.980> about<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.490> little

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
it's zero to sixty is about a little

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.090 
it's zero to sixty is about a little
under<00:01:29.090> six<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.480> half<00:01:29.510> seconds<00:01:30.110> but<00:01:30.680> on<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
under six and a half seconds but on the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.970 
under six and a half seconds but on the
road<00:01:32.110> when<00:01:33.110> we<00:01:33.410> drove<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.670> 2015<00:01:35.450> lineup<00:01:36.140> this

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
road when we drove the 2015 lineup this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.220 
road when we drove the 2015 lineup this
car<00:01:37.250> had<00:01:37.400> no<00:01:37.550> problem<00:01:37.910> keeping<00:01:38.180> up<00:01:38.360> with<00:01:38.540> the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
car had no problem keeping up with the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.770 
car had no problem keeping up with the
Hellcat<00:01:40.190> I<00:01:40.490> mean<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.120> Hellcat<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.540> going<00:01:41.690> to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
Hellcat I mean the Hellcat is going to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.080 
Hellcat I mean the Hellcat is going to
get<00:01:41.930> stopped<00:01:42.800> even<00:01:43.160> on<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> back<00:01:43.640> roads<00:01:43.970> we

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
get stopped even on the back roads we

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.390 
get stopped even on the back roads we
went<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.360> got<00:01:44.510> stopped<00:01:44.870> by<00:01:45.140> people<00:01:45.950> every<00:01:46.280> now

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
went to got stopped by people every now

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.300 
went to got stopped by people every now
and<00:01:46.550> then<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.090> just<00:01:47.300> can't<00:01:47.720> use<00:01:48.140> all<00:01:48.350> 707

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
and then and you just can't use all 707

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.900 
and then and you just can't use all 707
horsepower<00:01:49.780> this<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:51.050> not<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.770> bad<00:01:52.340> car<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.760> get

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
horsepower this is not a bad car you get

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.850 
horsepower this is not a bad car you get
the<00:01:52.970> good<00:01:53.300> handling<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.229> mean<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.470> brakes<00:01:54.710> are

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
the good handling I mean the brakes are

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.020 
the good handling I mean the brakes are
going<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.040> be<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.160> little<00:01:55.340> smaller<00:01:55.610> than<00:01:55.729> the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
going to be a little smaller than the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.700 
going to be a little smaller than the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.100 

it<00:02:26.959> gets<00:02:27.140> up<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.470> goes<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:28.040> mean<00:02:28.900> I'm<00:02:29.900> already

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
it gets up and goes I mean I'm already

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.550 
it gets up and goes I mean I'm already
to<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.920> 55<00:02:31.610> speed<00:02:32.030> limit<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.989> regular

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
to the 55 speed limit so on a regular

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.660 
to the 55 speed limit so on a regular
road<00:02:33.970> you're<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.530> not<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:37.959> miss

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
road you're going to not really miss

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.170 
road you're going to not really miss
this<00:02:40.670> car<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:43.160> over<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.700> RT

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
this car if you have this over the RT

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.090 
this car if you have this over the RT
the<00:02:44.959> RT<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:46.630> another<00:02:47.630> good<00:02:47.930> Road<00:02:48.290> car<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.890> would

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
the RT is another good Road car I would

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.880 
the RT is another good Road car I would
take<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.580> probably<00:02:50.300> over<00:02:50.510> most<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.319> SRT

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
take that probably over most of the SRT

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.420 
take that probably over most of the SRT
s<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.550> because<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:53.690> provides<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.560> little<00:02:55.280> bit

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
s just because it provides a little bit

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.100 
s just because it provides a little bit
more<00:02:55.580> horsepower<00:02:55.730> about<00:02:56.180> 70<00:02:56.540> more<00:02:56.660> horsepower

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
more horsepower about 70 more horsepower

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.610 
more horsepower about 70 more horsepower
than<00:02:57.349> this<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.670> get<00:02:59.660> going<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.350> has

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
than this so you can get going and has

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.970 
than this so you can get going and has
that<00:03:00.830> great<00:03:01.069> v8<00:03:01.370> sound<00:03:01.730> but<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:03.739> not

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
that great v8 sound but it's not

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.920 
that great v8 sound but it's not
overkill<00:03:04.700> for<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.030> road<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.480> others<00:03:05.720> just

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
overkill for the road the others just

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.960 
overkill for the road the others just
seemed<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.290> little<00:03:06.530> overkill<00:03:06.799> for<00:03:07.489> most<00:03:07.700> people

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
seemed a little overkill for most people

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.190 
seemed a little overkill for most people

beautifully on the track even just a
road<00:03:21.470> car<00:03:21.739> amazingly<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:22.819> if<00:03:23.480> you're<00:03:23.720> just

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
road car amazingly but if you're just

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.860

looking for a challenger you're thinking
well<00:03:27.280> should<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.370> get<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.730> VA<00:03:28.940> or<00:03:29.569> should<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.840> get

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
well should I get the VA or should I get

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.130 
well should I get the VA or should I get
the<00:03:30.080> better<00:03:30.230> gas<00:03:30.500> mileage<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:32.299> s60<00:03:32.930> enough

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
the better gas mileage is the s60 enough

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.910 
the better gas mileage is the s60 enough
performance<00:03:33.290> especially<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.260> 2015<00:03:36.260> model

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
performance especially in the 2015 model

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.180 
performance especially in the 2015 model
instead<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.609> 2014<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.480> older<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:40.100> get

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
instead of the 2014 and older you get

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.780 
instead of the 2014 and older you get
the<00:03:40.250> 8-speed<00:03:40.850> gearbox<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.670> just<00:03:43.670> a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the 8-speed gearbox and that is just a

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.440 
the 8-speed gearbox and that is just a
revolution<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.390> shifts<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:47.030> much<00:03:47.180> better

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
revolution it shifts so so much better

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
revolution it shifts so so much better
so

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.160 
so
this<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.670> fabulous<00:03:51.570> car<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:53.930> you'll<00:03:54.930> be
