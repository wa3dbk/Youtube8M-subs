00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.799
 informative of this page that is called 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.090
 the dotcom toaster is the tax 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.099
 services is to leave the link in the 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.480
 description is a page on which 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.410
 you can make your own designs and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.150
 sell them to the public and I do not know tell me you 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.369
 I'm going to promote it here on my own 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.470
 channel and then if you like one, you have 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.519
 example at the moment there are few designs there 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.379
 Well , sao, mainly, what are these 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.820
 of Kirito, these are without and that seems 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.040
 They do not carry anything but if you know them 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.880
 is that the drawing is behind here 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 You see the wooden 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.930
 and here is tennis decree in sweatshirt 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.220
 you cause of unisex boy girl where 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.510
 you also have for iphone 5 or iphone 4 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.580
 these two are here the book comes 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.390
 different than it has is that this is 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 subscribed and this has not so little 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.250
 You are from Iquitos and I really like them 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.210
 quite how it has been you are here as 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.300
 you have sensuality of girl and boy 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 this girl and the whole truth there 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.460
 Price differences depends on the model 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 what do you take for example the shirt 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.740
 basic costs less than this one that has 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.600
 then the edges in auto color and such but 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.310
 they are pretty cool you also have 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.979
 here with the logo of the channel because if 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.740
 Some of you like and I am a lover of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.290
 tribal bodies like me you also have 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.630
 here in bag for iphone 5 though 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.200
 this is true I do not think I've done it for 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.790
 do but I do not think it's good if 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.610
 I would be very excited that someone 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.330
 will take me later on the mobile these are 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.460
 the shirts that I like the most 2 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.600
 which are like that with the logo board before and not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.880
 what is behind also equally 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.960
 you can customize it by applying here 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.520
 you can customize 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.409
 for example this you can do more 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.600
 big 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.310
 good of hamÃ¡s because so that it is not 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.030
 lose the quality but you can do it 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.330
 smaller 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.900
 move it here although it stays a little there if 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.750
 you want you can remove the grid that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.950
 so that it looks good you can remove if not 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.950
 you like it and put another 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.579
 it's pretty you have it pretty good for 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.769
 customize your designs and if not 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.990
 you want ahead the athletes sorry 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.760
 You take it off and it's done 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.760
 just like you can choose 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.050
 for example let's see we like this 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 sweatshirt but we do not like the color 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.080
 you can put it in gray good ministers 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.360
 1 blue red white from each shirt or 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.670
 clothes in general have different colors 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.860
 for example here 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.420
 you can change them by color some 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.640
 designs for example this one that is black 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.340
 It does not look good if the capita is black 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.090
 but so with colors that stand out 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.099
 yes they look good 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.930
 I already say good and I tell you that you can 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.610
 move the design if you do not like it if you go 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.450
 to make it smaller bigger as 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.310
 you want 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.190
 the prices are fixed all are 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.310
 placed by the page 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.990
 with the small commission that I have to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.760
 normally if not this would not have 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.200
 sense 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.180
 but let's not expect that 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.090
 I'm lining up with this I think it 's a 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.640
 euro per shirt but let's basically 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.890
 that you can pay here puts it with 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.140
 credit card or paypal 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.560
 You can make the refund 30 days of 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.630
 guarantee for the return and nothing will go 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.220
 getting designs as they go 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.950
 happening because I can not be 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.410
 all day and night biting my head 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 what to do edit 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.090
 but well you can also give my ideas or 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.100
 even say you could do this to me in 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.020
 the video and leave me in the comments 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.760
 I would like you to make magnesites and 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.800
 with these pictures to see what you can 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.260
 to make this anime I would be happy 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.660
 a shirt or a sweatshirt and I can see 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.700
 what I can do is not very 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.240
 taken care of because for example this one is 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.910
 pretty much that if you're already shirt 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.560
 but good to me personally I like 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.970
 quite also to the wooden ones remain 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.910
 very cool on the bench 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.960
 and with the title of the 9th will give 15 and 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.440
 also those described I like quite 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 so nothing I hope you like and we 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.000
 we see the next video a greeting
