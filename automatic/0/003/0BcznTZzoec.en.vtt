00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730 

Aysen<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.480> musical<00:00:01.050> road<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.500> one<00:00:01.709> mile<00:00:01.949> ahead

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:03.740 
Aysen the musical road is one mile ahead

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.300 
Aysen the musical road is one mile ahead
and<00:00:03.890> it's<00:00:04.280> just<00:00:04.400> your<00:00:04.520> typical<00:00:05.920> desert<00:00:06.920> street

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
and it's just your typical desert street

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.350 
and it's just your typical desert street
huh

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
huh

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.350 
huh
so<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.140> think<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:10.920> have<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.250> go<00:00:11.370> 35<00:00:12.120> miles

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
so I think that we have to go 35 miles

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.200 
so I think that we have to go 35 miles
an<00:00:12.630> hour<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:13.290> order<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.830> hear<00:00:14.100> the<00:00:14.129> tune

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.210 
an hour in order to hear the tune

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.110 
an hour in order to hear the tune
now<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.500> speed<00:00:17.500> limits<00:00:17.800> 55<00:00:18.220> so<00:00:18.760> I<00:00:18.790> don't<00:00:19.000> know

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
now the speed limits 55 so I don't know

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.589 
now the speed limits 55 so I don't know
how

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
how

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.670 
how
if<00:00:21.019> you<00:00:21.169> turn<00:00:21.380> off<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.710> this<00:00:21.800> street

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.630 

so<00:00:27.189> we've<00:00:27.400> had<00:00:27.609> to<00:00:27.789> have<00:00:27.880> gone<00:00:28.060> a<00:00:28.090> mile

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
so we've had to have gone a mile

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.200 

don't<00:00:30.760> you<00:00:30.940> think
