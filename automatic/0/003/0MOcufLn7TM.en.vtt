00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.610 
have exas I am pretty confident that we
will<00:02:31.480> still<00:02:31.719> have<00:02:31.870> exas<00:02:32.379> i<00:02:32.620> do<00:02:32.709> not<00:02:33.310> see

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
will still have exas i do not see

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.830 
will still have exas i do not see
anything<00:02:35.620> else<00:02:35.980> coming<00:02:36.459> unless<00:02:37.450> they<00:02:37.689> decide

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
anything else coming unless they decide

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.709 
anything else coming unless they decide
to<00:02:38.609> make<00:02:39.609> a<00:02:39.669> new<00:02:39.939> thing<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.359> how<00:02:40.480> they<00:02:40.599> do<00:02:40.689> a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
to make a new thing like how they do a

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.709 
to make a new thing like how they do a
prime<00:02:41.139> i<00:02:41.919> enjoyed<00:02:42.760> prime<00:02:43.030> prime<00:02:43.329> was<00:02:43.510> pretty

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
prime i enjoyed prime prime was pretty

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.000 
prime i enjoyed prime prime was pretty
cool<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.790> love<00:02:45.790> Alexis<00:02:46.329> I<00:02:46.689> didn't<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.799> too

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
cool and love Alexis I didn't like too

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.619 
cool and love Alexis I didn't like too
much<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.370> those<00:02:48.489> basically<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.269> adding

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
much to those basically just adding

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.409 
much to those basically just adding
another<00:02:49.810> evolution<00:02:50.439> line<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.949> really<00:02:51.419> ruined

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
another evolution line not really ruined

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.289 
another evolution line not really ruined
it<00:02:52.689> for<00:02:53.049> most<00:02:53.379> in<00:02:53.859> today's<00:02:54.579> format<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.180> would

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
it for most in today's format that would

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.030 
it for most in today's format that would
just<00:02:55.449> not<00:02:55.569> work<00:02:55.719> that's<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> reason<00:02:56.859> why<00:02:56.919> they

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
just not work that's the reason why they

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.319 
just not work that's the reason why they
got<00:02:57.159> rid<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.310> level<00:02:57.549> X<00:02:57.639> is<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.939> that's<00:02:58.120> just

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
got rid of level X is that that's just

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.800 
got rid of level X is that that's just
gone<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:01.150> probably<00:03:01.419> one<00:03:01.629> of<00:03:01.659> the<00:03:01.780> reasons

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
gone that's probably one of the reasons

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.360 
gone that's probably one of the reasons
why<00:03:02.169> they<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.409> rid<00:03:02.439> of<00:03:02.620> level<00:03:02.859> X<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.099> because

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
why they got rid of level X is because

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.909 
why they got rid of level X is because
there<00:03:03.639> is<00:03:03.760> no<00:03:03.909> way<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.230> reviving<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.260> set<00:03:05.709> or

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
there is no way of reviving that set or

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.689 
there is no way of reviving that set or
bringing<00:03:06.519> those<00:03:06.699> cards<00:03:07.030> back<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:08.560> exas<00:03:09.519> was

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:09.699 
bringing those cards back now exas was

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.939 
bringing those cards back now exas was
the<00:03:09.819> original<00:03:10.329> is<00:03:10.540> what<00:03:11.290> they<00:03:11.409> had<00:03:11.530> normally

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:11.949 
the original is what they had normally

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:15.809 
the original is what they had normally
had<00:03:12.159> planned<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:14.189> that's<00:03:15.189> just<00:03:15.310> how<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.669> was

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
had planned and that's just how it was

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.259 
had planned and that's just how it was
going<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> be<00:03:16.239> now<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.430> noticed<00:03:18.970> with<00:03:19.120> the

the Escadrille DX and you'll see what I

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.770 
the Escadrille DX and you'll see what I
mean<00:03:48.370> where<00:03:48.699> it<00:03:48.790> says<00:03:48.939> just<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.239> basic<00:03:49.479> pokemon

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
mean where it says just a basic pokemon

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
mean where it says just a basic pokemon
and<00:03:50.259> you<00:03:51.099> know<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.250> thought<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.549> was<00:03:51.699> pretty

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
and you know I thought that was pretty

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.759 
and you know I thought that was pretty
weird<00:03:51.939> but<00:03:52.389> at<00:03:52.509> the<00:03:52.599> same<00:03:52.780> time<00:03:52.989> it's<00:03:53.319> pretty

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
weird but at the same time it's pretty

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.300 
weird but at the same time it's pretty
cool<00:03:53.949> because<00:03:54.780> no<00:03:55.780> evolution<00:03:56.680> change<00:03:56.949> and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
cool because no evolution change and

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.699 
cool because no evolution change and
it's<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.299> nice<00:03:58.509> sign<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.169> means<00:03:59.379> it's<00:03:59.620> not

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
it's a nice sign that means it's not

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.670 
it's a nice sign that means it's not
just<00:04:00.280> legendary<00:04:00.819> pokemon<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:02.379> are<00:04:02.500> going<00:04:02.620> to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.959 
going to turn out to be my only concern
is<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.319> no<00:04:08.459> legendaries<00:04:09.459> are<00:04:09.579> going<00:04:09.699> to<00:04:09.759> be

is that I no legendaries are going to be

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.939 
is that I no legendaries are going to be

do damage it could do certain things but
it's<00:04:44.050> more<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.440> thing<00:04:44.620> where<00:04:44.770> it's<00:04:44.889> not
