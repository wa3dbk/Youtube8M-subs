00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Hello you, I already have you 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.520
 a few vegan cosmetics products 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.140
 and today it's just about 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.940
 mascara I was already there 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.679
 Very often you ask this video 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.719
 Finally, because there are often many 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.519
 People do not have the right vegan 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.260
 mascara and I have 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.550
 really a lot of what kathrin will 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.940
 I also have several videos again 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.230
 do 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.060
 I do not like to point this out again 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.920
 that larger photos of the articles the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.300
 photos of the brushes and everything possible 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.949
 summarized again on my blog 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.480
 the link to this is one can be found 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.869
 description as the first I will give you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 like to show this here that is the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 altar natural cosmetics lesch extension 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.370
 mascara the special boni seasoning 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 gives your eyelashes extra length and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.460
 volume or synthetic 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.930
 preservatives eyes and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 contact lens compatibility 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.600
 ophthalmological confirmed and so on 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.770
 and so on and it's the color 0 1 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.390
 I lay here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.640
 and that's just what I have 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 brought because I class the evil so mega 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.109
 it is really a rubber brush 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 and I used to have my mascara the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.649
 on exactly the same to date and with 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.000
 I was so very satisfied 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.180
 and then the day someone from the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 been taken and since then 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.460
 I think that pretty much everyone knows 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.990
 Once you have found a job that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.650
 Superclass are then schwuppdiwupp out 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.240
 from the assortment 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.740
 but that's why I got the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.090
 I actually never got cara 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 So applied and the first time 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 directly the feeling that no product 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.460
 really got on the eyelashes because 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.580
 I notice no difference 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 could apply after several years 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.640
 about it going has as a small 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.200
 Change shown on the left in the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.640
 Real effect did not have that now 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.960
 I do not know how it is with you also 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.820
 me it's like I've been relatively 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 dark eyelashes watch the tips are at 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 me blonde and then when I mascara 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 then these will be stupid 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.320
 pointed first visible and then 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.420
 look the optically extended 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 although they are actually just as long and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 the mascara has done just that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.490
 only these tips extended but there was 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.860
 no real compaction or 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.080
 to see something so it was one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 relatively natural effect 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.900
 But I think that the brush at all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.860
 not suitable for the lower eyelashes 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.450
 is because that is a bit too thick 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.770
 You then come down to the permanent 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.910
 Turned off and then you did not cut 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.980
 want everything that's really 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.050
 unpleasant from the problem of natural cosmetics 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.540
 mascara is actually as at the moment 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.650
 at least that was the very long 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.240
 need to dry are also 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.860
 mostly more fluid than other mascara 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.480
 and in what has so synonymous the companies 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.190
 took a long time to dry 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.140
 and while there are dry process the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.970
 then glued together and it was like that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.500
 not so nice the mascara would be me 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.060
 actually only people recommend the from 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.260
 nature of extremely bright eyelashes arms it 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.270
 gives people the example completely 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.040
 Blond vamp on to the easy 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.480
 to color it is good but really 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.950
 The thickening and lengthening does the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 really is not over actually 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.550
 more so natural and something different 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.140
 that in my opinion not 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.150
 really suitable is the durability 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.380
 So long for natural cosmetics as well 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.510
 It's always such a thing, though 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.670
 after a while you smear that one 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.410
 So here's a little dots she has 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.970
 is extremely water sensitive and me 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.550
 I really often have watery eyes and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.410
 then it understands immediately so it is 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.020
 not suitable in everyday life 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.140
 I personally find the mother of tish 43 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.519
 tasted and i would honestly 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.870
 said not recommend 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.250
 next i have here from alverde 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.989
 the eyecatcher mascara are the out and about 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.760
 quite honestly 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.920
 by the way, it is astonishing 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.709
 Extensions fibers from oats and 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.550
 special flower fair for optical maxi 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.200
 eyelashes 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.640
 So far, I am of the values ​​of mascara 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.870
 really always a bit disappointed 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.190
 I have to say I 've even got it 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.810
 it is said at naturkosmetik 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.280
 somehow they always do not last as well 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.200
 are liquid glued the have 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.150
 no real booster effect that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.709
 They say so was eyelashes so I like to 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.910
 me personally if you like that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.010
 really artificial from really 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.690
 extremely elongated extremely compacted 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.190
 fake lashes and the problem is too 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.260
 that is me now at the p2 and will 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.790
 also noticed that the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.320
 at least mascara of it really vegan 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.890
 and because most of the holders are beeswax 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.370
 contain 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.370
 and that's why anyway 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.940
 a drugstore hard I found the brush 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.239
 It will be very interesting and that will happen 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.110
 first time with it really basta 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.310
 getting used to but if you look 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.379
 then it gets used to it 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.430
 actually very great, I think 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.870
 just stop that when you apply 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.400
 Be careful not to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.810
 a lot of mascara occur in the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.370
 spaces between brushes 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.890
 unfortunately a lot of mascara and if you are 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.409
 then often another table or 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.340
 deep into the eyelashes class I enter 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.049
 Hope you know what I mean 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 then comes too much product 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.560
 The eyelashes are glued just there 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.239
 you have to be very careful when you are 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.769
 it really carefully and sparingly 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.750
 wears then very beautiful 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.440
 naturally lengthened and condensed 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.570
 eyelashes 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.669
 I think this is always a great effect 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.340
 still relatively natural, but still 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.620
 already well booked so the eyelashes 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.539
 are compressed already extended is 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.070
 sticks me unless you like wearing 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.570
 said so much of the product though 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.740
 Of course, it is my own fault 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.600
 otherwise you really have a super nice 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.430
 result the shelf life 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.050
 Well, as I said it is a natural cosmetics 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.550
 its always such a thing but for 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.080
 natural cosmetics freedom is japanese the 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.180
 not really good so in the normal 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.090
 He actually keeps things pretty good everyday 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.220
 does not crumble and does not taste 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.900
 römer gate stood 3 eur 590 tasted found 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.250
 I totally for drogerie especially for 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.169
 natural cosmetics time, it is even right 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.240
 really good so if someone has a good one 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.440
 natural cosmetics man tables can then seek 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.080
 I just recommend that's the way 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.090
 the color 10 you lay yes I have 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.680
 mostly black mascara then I have 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.340
 sometimes which of rossmann and indeed 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.380
 by rivaldo the magic ball mascara for 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.260
 volume and denser eyelashes that have 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.389
 I once in ten black and 0 2 dark 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.590
 brown and I have extra times 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.370
 both versions are brought because I just 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.780
 wanted to see 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.120
 what does it look like on the outside with brown 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.010
 mascara somber difference or me 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.539
 really never had one with me 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.979
 brown what can I think so because of that 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.300
 I'm interested because the two 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.039
 Vegans I said I'll get me 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.800
 Just come in and I can stop there 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.819
 always have to compare and watch 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.650
 and look at the farc as well 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.500
 difference and so on and have 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.720
 just a typical standard brush 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.340
 again is quite okay when I catch 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.750
 I noticed that everywhere equally 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.060
 product is distributed it goes very much 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.500
 quickly found the result very easy 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.860
 Me too okay, it was beautiful 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.729
 optical extension beautiful compaction 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.860
 overall still a natural one 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.180
 effect for me the durability okay for 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.830
 kept the whole day it has nothing 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.099
 you can actually get a jerk 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.039
 does not complain the cost two euro 49 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.990
 only a small drawback I think that one 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.069
 with the colors so the need black 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.750
 not really seen a difference 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.069
 So I 've got it from me at all 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.719
 no difference seen 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.069
 Real what you can you like to say 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.719
 I also see your difference 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.210
 see quite a bit different 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.289
 cost as I said 249 then I have me 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.120
 the same product again as 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.319
 fetched waterproof it is exactly that 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.090
 same brush exactly the same 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.889
 properties holds just as well 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.960
 well to apply it is the same sorry 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.969
 as waterproof and I need one 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.099
 bike because I finally have the eyes 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.090
 like to tears and then you stop 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.979
 permanently afraid that something 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.240
 smeared and so and that's why I have 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.190
 I'm always brought and I 've got them since then 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.110
 it is not a regular pleasure though 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.669
 so I say audi is super class 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.159
 no other but how it stops 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.779
 just good but the perfect mascara 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.409
 I do not have it for me now either 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.150
 found 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.529
 but this is alright that i would like that 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.169
 I also recommend it to everyone 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:50.340
 waterproof mascara would like to use that 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.930
 problem is that I'm all in 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.520
 relatively natural effect couples like 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.659
 I would like to eyelash that choice 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.490
 that's just always one 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.169
 that's why I like it a bit difficult 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.520
 fake lashes is a dear if you 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.139
 possibly still vegan mascara 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.580
 knows where he thinks he can 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.180
 be the shortest or should you 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.650
 try it out 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.029
 you are welcome to comment 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.199
 to experience writing then that's it 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.250
 now synonymous with this video if you 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.539
 I liked the video 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.800
 huge over the thumbs upwards 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.599
 and if you subscribe to my channel 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.500
 did not want to do that then 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.180
 can you still my two 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.800
 watch last videos that was once 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.969
 the used up video to the cosmetics 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.529
 things that I have also used the 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.840
 I tell you once top or flop were 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:23.849
 the products and my vegan football 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.110
 again a new one then many thanks 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:28.069
 for pulling and picking 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.069
 and soon it will be okay again
