keep<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.820> mind<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.240> said<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> prototype

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
keep in mind I said this is a prototype

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.580 
keep in mind I said this is a prototype
nothing<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> bolted<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> help<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.380> actually

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
nothing is bolted to help we actually

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
nothing is bolted to help we actually
have<00:00:22.949> clamps<00:00:23.519> holding<00:00:23.670> everything<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.480> place

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
have clamps holding everything in place

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
have clamps holding everything in place
but<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> test<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.789> see

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
but we're going to test it like you see

Kraft set of hulls now all up wait you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
Kraft set of hulls now all up wait you

the<00:00:55.530> drive<00:00:55.770> unit<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.550> different<00:00:56.910> drive

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the drive unit because different drive

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
the drive unit because different drive
units<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> weigh<00:00:58.140> different

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
units are going to weigh different

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.430 
units are going to weigh different
amount<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.300> generally<00:01:00.539> lighter<00:01:01.140> than

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
amount so it's generally lighter than

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
amount so it's generally lighter than
most<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:02.010> pedal<00:01:02.640> craft<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.329> four<00:01:03.510> feet

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
most all pedal craft and at four feet

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
most all pedal craft and at four feet
wide<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.100> order<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.430> wider<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
wide and you can order it wider so that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.500 
wide and you can order it wider so that
you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.450> use<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> sail<00:01:07.140> boat<00:01:07.350> -<00:01:08.510> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you can use it as a sail boat - this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.870 
you can use it as a sail boat - this
should<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> real<00:01:10.140> good<00:01:10.170> performer<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.670> one

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
should be a real good performer this one

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
should be a real good performer this one
is<00:01:12.030> eventually<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.260> tandem<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
is eventually going to be a tandem and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
is eventually going to be a tandem and
we've<00:01:14.729> left<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> center<00:01:15.659> empty<00:01:16.229> because

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
we've left the center empty because

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
we've left the center empty because
we're<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.009> two<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:17.790> pedal

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
we're going to have two of these pedal

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.550 
we're going to have two of these pedal
drives<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:19.880> be<00:01:20.880> further<00:01:21.180> back<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.350> other

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
drives one be further back and the other

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.219 
drives one be further back and the other
further<00:01:23.220> forward<00:01:23.880> we're<00:01:24.450> also<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> try

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
further forward we're also going to try

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.510 
further forward we're also going to try
this<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.650> vote<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.840> twenty-foot

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
this very vote in a twenty-foot

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.679 
this very vote in a twenty-foot
configuration<00:01:29.520> it'd<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.729> 20<00:01:30.090> feet<00:01:30.119> 9<00:01:30.659> inches

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
configuration it'd be 20 feet 9 inches

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
configuration it'd be 20 feet 9 inches
and<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.579> done<00:01:32.820> over<00:01:33.570> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and that's going to be done over in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.819 
and that's going to be done over in
Washington<00:01:34.350> State

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
Washington State

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.319 
Washington State
so<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.040> look<00:01:35.220> forward<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> getting<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.030> video
