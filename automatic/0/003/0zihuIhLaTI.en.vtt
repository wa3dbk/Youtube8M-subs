00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello because only many welcome a 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.089
 day more to my channel today I bring you a 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.400
 new video that are some back tips 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.130
 to school and it was a little herding 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.590
 because I do not know they are not big enough to stay 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.080
 with that and if you want to see it if you know 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.500
 mystics from back to school we started with 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.500
 the video 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.350
 robert and is that you buy the material 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.330
 I think that is the most obvious 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.190
 world but this title I wanted to put 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.440
 because I fixed that you have the things of the year 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.720
 past they are pretty good even 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.670
 in the notebooks that you have started but 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.530
 you have not finished is what more 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
 I recommend that, well, those that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.570
 you can use him then remove those 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.970
 leaves and follow it using the other 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.280
 that are left because I think that little to 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.130
 little we are helping our daddies and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 Well, we are always contributing 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.460
 Well, our little grain of sand for 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.320
 save a little at home and in the material 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 school is to say it's pretty clear 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 no longer by talking about the books that are 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.640
 very expensive the second time is for 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.940
 be as clear and it is I think that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 very obvious very normal and you have to sleep 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.260
 those eight hours and if this guy also 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.730
 I have to start applying it myself 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 because I'm going to bed late 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.330
 get up late to bed late 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.730
 get up late a life like that a little 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.860
 nocturnal although good I have to lift 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.120
 quite early some days of the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.310
 week but 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.620
 keep falling and cause totally would be the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.360
 next I get up late and if you fire 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.180
 is scratching with these magicians try to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.730
 lift two it cost me to get up but it 's 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.280
 true two thousand and eight hours like this or center 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.070
 it's a lot better, more clear and like 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.350
 happen to me you will be much less tired 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 and in this time I look like your father 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 your mother who always tells you you have 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 to eat well do not leave anything in the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.220
 Such dish is valid for those who already 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.170
 we eat what we want and everything and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.090
 that many times we do not get up for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 the morning then we no longer have breakfast 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.910
 then the time to eat the same we continue 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.880
 sleeping with cheese happens in summer yes and 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.190
 we no longer eat the same simply 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 we have dinner and things like that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.429
 get back to our rhythm and it's better 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.200
 have breakfast 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 obviously breakfast is one of the things 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.830
 most important I recommend that you 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.990
 seal the milk juice and one 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.880
 tostaditas and also good then in the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.850
 I reuse what you only wear more class 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
 it's an apple or any fruit because 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.680
 the truth is that it gives me a lot 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.440
 vitality and the tip is very very good 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.560
 number 5 is to have an agenda if I am 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.910
 sincere here I have many details like 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.010
 a trip in is true that has not 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.350
 numbers of the week that is 10 of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.820
 other weeks do not have people 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.490
 totally blank where I go 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.290
 pointing everything I'm pointing the videos 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.030
 especially now in summer this day 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.760
 I want to record such during the day I want to record 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.220
 such the agenda without a doubt is a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.050
 of the things of the most important and 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.450
 now yes this guy I think is very 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.820
 important you always have to have the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.070
 class schedule in sight yo 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.510
 I recommend that you have in your room 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.760
 or good there are many people who have it in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.070
 your kitchen in the fridge and everything but good 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.320
 I have it in my room and then I have 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.030
 one in each class book I have 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.310
 the typical ring binders in the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.990
 that you have several resignations then 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.209
 I usually carry two so I just have to 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.040
 have two but if I do not recommend you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.069
 you put it in all all the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.349
 notebooks so you always organize 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.629
 or books are forgotten at home because 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.090
 I used to spend this time before now 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.829
 they follow me that is to think of the morning what 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.510
 what you want to do throughout the day 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.180
 it takes me a lot to do more 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.310
 things although he is sincere many times 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.379
 is done if a little thing but try 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.629
 do everything and that helps me not to have 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.299
 the typical boring days in beds without 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.400
 do anything that one sometimes fancy but 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.950
 I try not to have them because it 's one day 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.530
 wasted and good this clear tip 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.510
 you can use it without being to go 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.269
 to class because I use it throughout 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.310
 of the year and it helps me a lot every day what 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.560
 What I recommend is that you make a minor 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.599
 sumen can already be in dirty as 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.239
 you want what you have given 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.370
 in class that day it 's true that I 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.709
 sometimes I do it the next day or even 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.389
 another but I always do because that 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.449
 it's much easier for me to study 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.879
 then for the examination when this 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:18.039
 summary I'm reading it several days 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.430
 several days several days and when is the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.410
 exam I assure you is very very practical 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.150
 because things are already sounding and I 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.350
 it's a lot easier to study and I 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.780
 they carry a lot less 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.260
 I think this and all you do is 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.390
 very very very very obvious that is to underline 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.030
 the important things 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.490
 I go as I'm going to edit the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.710
 web class underlining those keywords 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.320
 those important things and I at the time of 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.120
 study you open the book and your eyes go 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.190
 for that word then you do not know 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.870
 Forget more at least to me it 's true 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.400
 the tips back to class not 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.740
 everyone will go to work the 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.380
 This same hard for me much 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.410
 very much very much but in the end when 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.690
 I get it I appreciate it a lot and it's 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.310
 have the notebook organized too 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.980
 it depends a lot on the teacher they make you 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.200
 study by the book or by the notebook and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.150
 I am quite disorganized then 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.360
 it's very important that you have the 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.810
 notebook very very well organized organized 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.780
 and that is too important and 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.480
 now let's do 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.580
 our parents once again in the typical 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.900
 phrase do not leave for tomorrow what you can 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.000
 do today and if we have to recognize all 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.940
 I was going to say it is to recognize but not 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.010
 you also from the typical thing that you 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.450
 send home homework and look at the 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.120
 next day's schedule is not 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.580
 subject and you say your pain in total 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.860
 tomorrow I do not have and the next day you 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.320
 they forget and you do not make them of that class without 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.970
 do it if you then that you go sometimes 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.700
 then you have to pay attention to it because 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.760
 they are right you have to admit that they have 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.130
 reason and now this guy is like more 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.020
 relative if you want to do very well I 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.850
 I do it then that's why I tell you and 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.710
 choose the clothes the day before because 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.710
 so I get up a lot more relaxed 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.290
 with more time and I do not know I do not care 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.450
 for not seeing in time I do not know what I'm going to 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.280
 catch and stress very early in the morning 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.160
 that they take everything to me all the calm one with 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.120
 my clothes caught and for me it's the best thing about 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.790
 I do not like the world 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.949
 and this guy I recommend a lot of good 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.830
 these have been the tips of the return to 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.840
 class are my uncles and as I said 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.240
 before you do not have to have the same 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.880
 The truth is that I like it a lot 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.100
 have a few tips and I'm mentalizing 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.290
 and I'm trying to fulfill them all is 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.139
 true that I do not always fulfill them 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.419
 be sincere and all this there are some that 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.669
 yes there are others that there are no others that 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.530
 try and sometimes yes sometimes not and I 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:47.370
 I 'm here to say goodbye 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.630

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.610
