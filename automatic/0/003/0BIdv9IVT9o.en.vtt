00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
maybe that's a good natural to probably

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.030 
maybe that's a good natural to probably
enough<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:30.860> better<00:02:31.040> than<00:02:31.160> my<00:02:31.310> left<00:02:32.980> see<00:02:33.980> how

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
enough it's better than my left see how

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.860 
enough it's better than my left see how
I'll<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.340> how<00:02:34.430> hard<00:02:34.940> hardest<00:02:35.420> puff<00:02:35.570> has<00:02:35.720> been

some reason I don't expect to be seeing

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.860 
some reason I don't expect to be seeing
as<00:02:51.130> many<00:02:51.280> pivot<00:02:51.730> our<00:02:51.850> F<00:02:52.000> smashes<00:02:52.390> oh<00:02:52.510> yeah<00:02:52.840> I

don't think he realized that this was a

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.830 
don't think he realized that this was a
stage<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.310> easily<00:02:54.940> counter<00:02:55.330> big<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.630> gets

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
stage that easily counter big that gets

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.890 
stage that easily counter big that gets
capital<00:02:56.410> came<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.100> either<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.700> see<00:02:58.630> how<00:02:58.660> this
