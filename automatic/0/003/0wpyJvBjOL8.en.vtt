well this fall has a 74 response
paralyzed<00:00:52.940> cover<00:00:53.239> stock<00:00:53.540> on<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:54.410> has<00:00:54.590> a

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
paralyzed cover stock on it and it has a

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.830 
paralyzed cover stock on it and it has a
temperature<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.190> symmetrical<00:00:55.760> core<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.629> core

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
temperature of symmetrical core the core

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.790 
temperature of symmetrical core the core
has<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.080> 2.5<00:00:57.800> 1rg<00:00:58.430> with<00:00:58.610> an<00:00:58.760> o<00:00:58.940> 42<00:00:59.360> death<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.350> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
has a 2.5 1rg with an o 42 death so this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.290 
has a 2.5 1rg with an o 42 death so this
ball<00:01:01.040> is<00:01:01.220> supposed<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.580> get<00:01:01.760> further<00:01:02.030> down

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.569 

so<00:04:07.829> we<00:04:07.890> just<00:04:08.010> think<00:04:08.129> about<00:04:08.220> it

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
so we just think about it

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.670 
so we just think about it
when<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.269> ball<00:04:09.420> caught<00:04:09.599> down<00:04:09.840> Lane<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.349> then

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
when that ball caught down Lane and then

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.940 
when that ball caught down Lane and then
had<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.099> real<00:04:11.640> strong<00:04:12.239> arcing<00:04:13.079> move<00:04:13.290> off<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.739> it

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
had a real strong arcing move off of it

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.710 
had a real strong arcing move off of it
so<00:04:14.159> compared<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.730> your<00:04:14.970> other<00:04:15.000> respect<00:04:15.569> we

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
so compared to your other respect we

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.449 
so compared to your other respect we
think<00:04:15.930> about<00:04:15.989> this<00:04:16.169> one<00:04:16.320> oh<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.530> think<00:04:16.799> this

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
think about this one oh I think this

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.650 
think about this one oh I think this
one's<00:04:17.729> gonna<00:04:17.910> get<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.120> little<00:04:18.299> bit<00:04:18.389> further

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660

an interesting ball to watch I mean it's
it's<00:04:42.330> pearlized<00:04:42.780> ball<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.139> it's<00:04:43.289> it's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
it's pearlized ball so it's it's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.290 
it's pearlized ball so it's it's
designed<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.370> get<00:04:44.550> through<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.850> fronts<00:04:45.150> like

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
designed to get through the fronts like

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.529 
designed to get through the fronts like
that<00:04:45.479> so<00:04:45.720> yeah<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.350> can<00:04:47.310> see<00:04:47.729> using<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:48.330> game

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
that so yeah I can see using this game
