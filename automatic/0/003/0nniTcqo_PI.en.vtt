00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:08.916
A while ago we showed you the existence of the so-called 'Orvillecopter'

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.960
Half cat, half helicopter

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.023
But that was just a prototype,
the masterpiece is now completed

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:18.390
Therefore an urgent advice to Marianne Thieme (Animal Party) and consorts:

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.177
Don't watch for the coming minute

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:38.290
- It's the Orvillecopter, that sounds very exciting
- Yes, it's my cat..

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.613
- That was your cat..

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:44.536
I once bought two cats to get rid of the mice,
and one got ran over last year, it was Orville

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:49.807
Did you think when that happened, very sad
but I'm doing things with dead animals?

00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:50.921
This is a real nice opportunity

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:59.257
It was really 2 days of sorrow, and after the 2nd day it was really done
I thought: And now something fun

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:03.042
I've had him in the fridge for half a year, just next to the croquettes..

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:07.338
..to give me the time to work out my idea

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.468
But Orville is named after one of the first people who flew,
the brothers Wright...Orville Wright

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.719
- Correct
- So he was meant to fly?

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.200
- Do you think that this what Orville wanted?
- Absolutely

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.240
- He really wanted to fly?
- He terribly loved little birds

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:29.049
- We can take a look under the hood
- I'm curious what Orville has to offer

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:34.087
- You know exactly what Orville has under the hood?
- Yes, Orville is good for some 600 Watt

00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:39.126
- Besides knowing a lot, you're the only one that can fly with him.
You can't even fly it?

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:41.023
No, I really should take lessons first

00:01:41.123 --> 00:01:42.354
Just some petting

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:07.431
- He looks really anxious
- He looks concentrated

00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.275
- How high can he?
- Theoretically a kilometer

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.598
This is really awsome

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:27.006
Let's see how the cows will react

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:31.069
Get them..get them Orville

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:48.321
I really enjoyed this flying thing so let's stick to this,
so I'm going to fly more things

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:51.386
A flying blue whale, that would be awsome..
some 30 metres or so

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:53.592
Good idea's, there's plenty to be done!
