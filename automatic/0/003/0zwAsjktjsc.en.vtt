sequences at Edwards and i love the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.080 
sequences at Edwards and i love the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
default edwards scenery that comes with

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.740 
default edwards scenery that comes with
the<00:00:18.180> acceleration<00:00:18.690> pack<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.410> felt<00:00:20.750> well

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the acceleration pack but I felt well

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.670 
the acceleration pack but I felt well
you<00:00:21.810> know<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.109> don't<00:00:22.289> even<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you know what I don't even know what I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.929 
you know what I don't even know what I
felt<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.160> didn't<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.430> combined<00:00:23.789> with

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
felt I just didn't like a combined with

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.310 
felt I just didn't like a combined with
the<00:00:24.000> extra<00:00:24.240> 300<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:24.750> some<00:00:24.900> reason<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.289> i

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the extra 300 for some reason so i

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.160 
the extra 300 for some reason so i
reloaded<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> sequences<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.609> Stuart<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
reloaded the sequences it's Stuart and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.450 
reloaded the sequences it's Stuart and
here<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:28.920> favorite<00:00:29.099> paint

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
here it is I think my favorite paint

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
here it is I think my favorite paint
would<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> Red<00:00:30.480> Bull<00:00:30.720> finish<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
would be the Red Bull finish the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
would be the Red Bull finish the
modeling<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> VC<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.430> probably<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
modeling and the VC is probably some of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.090 
modeling and the VC is probably some of
the<00:00:33.090> best<00:00:33.149> I've<00:00:33.510> ever<00:00:33.540> worked<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:35.010> about
