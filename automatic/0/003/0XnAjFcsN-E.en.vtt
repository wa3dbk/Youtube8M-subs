explore the natural environment and
learn<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> natural<00:02:03.750> environment<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
learn about the natural environment so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.850 
learn about the natural environment so
that<00:02:04.530> they'll<00:02:04.830> want<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.220> protect<00:02:05.580> it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
that they'll want to protect it
