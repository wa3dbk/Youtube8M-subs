I<00:00:00.089> believe<00:00:00.750> in<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:00.960> power<00:00:01.170> of<00:00:01.290> images<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.010> think

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
I believe in the power of images I think

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.249 
I believe in the power of images I think
I<00:00:02.639> wouldn't<00:00:03.030> be<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> photographer<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.780> didn't

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
I wouldn't be a photographer I didn't

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.900 
I wouldn't be a photographer I didn't
believe<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.740> power<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.069> images<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.670> think

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
believe in the power of images I think

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.650 
believe in the power of images I think
there's<00:00:06.330> an<00:00:06.450> immediacy<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> an<00:00:07.410> image<00:00:07.740> that

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
there's an immediacy to an image that

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.570 
there's an immediacy to an image that
obviously<00:00:09.660> text<00:00:10.349> or<00:00:10.500> writing<00:00:10.860> doesn't<00:00:11.190> have

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
obviously text or writing doesn't have

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.180 
obviously text or writing doesn't have
they<00:00:12.360> both<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.870> incredibly<00:00:13.380> powerful<00:00:13.860> tools

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
they both are incredibly powerful tools

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.519 
they both are incredibly powerful tools
but<00:00:14.580> they<00:00:14.730> hit<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:15.660> moments<00:00:15.719> so

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
but they hit you at different moments so

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.790 
but they hit you at different moments so
an<00:00:16.800> image<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:18.060> speak<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.600> people<00:00:18.990> really

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
an image that can speak to people really

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.650 
an image that can speak to people really
can<00:00:20.070> bring<00:00:20.400> them<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.939> place<00:00:20.970> or

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
can bring them to that place or

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
can bring them to that place or
transport<00:00:22.590> them<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.160> moment<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.090> pain<00:00:24.510> or

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
transport them to that moment of pain or

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.560 
transport them to that moment of pain or
that<00:00:25.019> moment<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.710> urgency<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.449> whatever<00:00:27.449> that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
that moment of urgency or whatever that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
that moment of urgency or whatever that
emotion<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.619> trying<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> convey<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
emotion is I'm trying to convey in that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.060 
emotion is I'm trying to convey in that
image<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.140> image<00:00:31.470> has<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
image I think that an image has the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.400 
image I think that an image has the
ability<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> take<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.870> viewer<00:00:34.140> there

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
ability to take the viewer there

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.360 
ability to take the viewer there
immediately<00:00:35.180> sometimes<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.750> feel<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
immediately sometimes I feel like a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
immediately sometimes I feel like a
hunter<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.450> feel<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.989> walk<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
hunter I can feel like I walk into a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.810 
hunter I can feel like I walk into a
scene<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.660> kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.320> look<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.670> thing

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
scene and I kind of look the first thing

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
scene and I kind of look the first thing
I<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> look<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> light<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.379> figure

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
I do is look at the light and I figure

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
I do is look at the light and I figure
out<00:00:46.950> where<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.550> light<00:00:47.879> interesting<00:00:48.539> where's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
out where is light interesting where's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.350 
out where is light interesting where's
light<00:00:49.320> source<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.070> where<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> falling<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
light source and where is it falling and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
light source and where is it falling and
then<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> look<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.469> expressions<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.160> people

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
then I look at the expressions on people

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
then I look at the expressions on people
and<00:00:53.730> their<00:00:53.940> faces<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:55.140> trying<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> think

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and their faces and I'm trying to think

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
and their faces and I'm trying to think
about<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> story<00:00:56.850> I'm<00:00:57.030> trying<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
about what is the story I'm trying to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
about what is the story I'm trying to
tell<00:00:57.629> or<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> story<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.160> being

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
tell or what is the story that's being

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
tell or what is the story that's being
conveyed<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> me<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> look

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
conveyed to me and then I have to look

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.709 
conveyed to me and then I have to look
for<00:01:02.010> details<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.879> looking<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.449> sort<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
for details I'm looking for sort of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
for details I'm looking for sort of
anything<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> might<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.799> interesting<00:01:05.430> or

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
anything that might be interesting or

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.469 
anything that might be interesting or
might<00:01:06.390> sort<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> convey<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> message<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
might sort of convey a message and I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
might sort of convey a message and I
often<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.560> circle<00:01:11.100> around<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.640> seen

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
often kind of circle around that seen

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
often kind of circle around that seen
several<00:01:12.390> times<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.110> I'll<00:01:13.260> look<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.560> from

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
several times so I'll look at it from

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
several times so I'll look at it from
the<00:01:13.920> front<00:01:14.130> from<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> side<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> back

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the front from the side from the back

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.410 
the front from the side from the back
I'll<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.259> around<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.740> few<00:01:17.220> times<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.180> how

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I'll go around a few times and see how

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
I'll go around a few times and see how
the<00:01:18.479> light<00:01:18.750> changes<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.619> backlit<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.369> I'm

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the light changes if it's backlit if I'm

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
the light changes if it's backlit if I'm
shooting<00:01:20.729> straight<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.080> often<00:01:22.710> I'll

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
shooting straight on and then often I'll

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010 
shooting straight on and then often I'll
shoot<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.000> hell<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.600> i<00:01:24.659> mean<00:01:24.869> i'll

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
shoot the hell out of it i mean i'll

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
shoot the hell out of it i mean i'll
shoot<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.470> every<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:25.979> way<00:01:26.040> i<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.580> i'm<00:01:27.180> kind

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
shoot it every which way i can i'm kind

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.749 
shoot it every which way i can i'm kind
of<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:28.229> unconventional<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:29.189> how<00:01:29.340> i<00:01:29.369> learned

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
of very unconventional on how i learned

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
of very unconventional on how i learned
to<00:01:30.000> compose<00:01:30.479> pictures<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.500> trial

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to compose pictures it was really trial

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.120 
to compose pictures it was really trial
and<00:01:31.979> error<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.790> me<00:01:33.079> I'm<00:01:34.079> often<00:01:34.380> trying<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and error so for me I'm often trying to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550 
and error so for me I'm often trying to
fit<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.759> certain<00:01:36.180> amount<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.540> information<00:01:36.869> into

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
fit a certain amount of information into

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
fit a certain amount of information into
a<00:01:37.590> frame<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.430> trying<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> tell<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> story<00:01:39.479> with

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a frame I'm trying to tell a story with

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.950 
a frame I'm trying to tell a story with
each<00:01:39.960> picture<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> lot<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
each picture so that has a lot to do

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.840 
each picture so that has a lot to do
with<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.320> compose<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> picture<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> then

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
with how I compose a picture and then

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760
