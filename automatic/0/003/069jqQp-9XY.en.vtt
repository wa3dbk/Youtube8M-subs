00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
get another goal but then you take the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.630 
get another goal but then you take the
ball<00:03:24.110> from<00:03:24.140> us<00:03:24.560> right<00:03:24.799> there<00:03:25.040> but<00:03:25.250> we're<00:03:25.400> still

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
ball from us right there but we're still

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.569 
ball from us right there but we're still
in<00:03:25.670> position<00:03:26.320> but<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> goalie<00:03:27.739> gets<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.340> right

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
in position but the goalie gets it right

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.580 
in position but the goalie gets it right
there<00:03:28.910> he<00:03:29.269> lucked<00:03:29.510> out<00:03:29.720> didn't<00:03:30.110> he<00:03:30.140> people<00:03:30.470> he

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
there he lucked out didn't he people he

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.390 
there he lucked out didn't he people he
lucked<00:03:30.829> out

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
lucked out

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.910 
lucked out
so<00:03:32.180> we<00:03:32.329> still<00:03:32.630> won<00:03:32.989> nothing<00:03:33.440> we're<00:03:33.620> coming

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
so we still won nothing we're coming

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.410 
so we still won nothing we're coming
down<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.280> end<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.730> game<00:03:35.030> we've<00:03:35.269> been

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
down to the end of this game we've been

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.630 
down to the end of this game we've been
doing<00:03:35.750> our<00:03:35.840> thing<00:03:36.140> all<00:03:36.440> season<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.280> think<00:03:37.489> we

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
doing our thing all season I think we

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.670 
doing our thing all season I think we
dropped<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.060> few<00:03:38.239> games<00:03:38.480> though<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.049> we're

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
dropped a few games though so we're

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.620 
dropped a few games though so we're
probably<00:03:39.860> about<00:03:40.130> five<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.910> two<00:03:41.060> five<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
probably about five and two five and

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.360 
probably about five and two five and
three<00:03:41.840> something<00:03:42.079> like<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.190> we're

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
three something like that so we're

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.069 
three something like that so we're
trying<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.760> make<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> run<00:03:44.209> look<00:03:44.540> at<00:03:44.630> me<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.780> want
