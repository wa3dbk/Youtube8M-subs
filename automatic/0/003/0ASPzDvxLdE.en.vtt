00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.140
 speaks guys all with you here the merit 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.639
 that the invitations and in the video let's talk 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 about the games that will end your 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.469
 relationship you have friends one 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.780
 girlfriend of a family member who 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.369
 Do you want to pay attention then keep the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 distance from the bonds I'm going to be 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 at this moment let's go 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 Our first game today is easy made 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.029
 and 12 the game actually looks like a rpg 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.970
 online only without the 1 part line you 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.529
 walk around hps hospital and actually 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 Reminds me enough that it was enough. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 inspired by the final fantasy 11 and despite 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.360
 to have a much better story and such 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.489
 huh 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 he is really very big you pass 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.770
 20 hours so just to have the beginning of the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.350
 There are a lot of people who already have 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 more than 600 hours trying to do 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 absolutely everything in the volume 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 total including one of the titles 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.989
 totally choose to rock a remake 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 hd it next year or this year all 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.590
 only to ruin with a few more lives 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.570
 when the next game on our list goes 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 end your relationships not 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 because of addiction he or better in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.450
 truth must be fucking also more 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.270
 also because it ends up generating some 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.340
 bickering I'm talking about the worms 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.810
 battle game the little worms you already 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.729
 must have played once in a while he goes 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.530
 Destroy such scenario you have to kill 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.659
 the opposing team and in some things 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.330
 Bizarre and very funny for those who enjoy 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.159
 black humor in the middle well imagine that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.970
 fight with the employer because of a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.450
 part of the game 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.799
 because it is and our next game will also 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.259
 make you fight with the patrol 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.009
 possibly some friends who is mario 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.630
 party 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.939
 who never played the most part home 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 right good it is a board game 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.659
 Only Nintendo you play in the video game 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.590
 You advance the map through the mini 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.479
 games capital 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.159
 no one is more bizarre than the other 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 you probably will not have time to 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 learn to do what has a name and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.600
 failed heavily so do not play in 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.280
 mario party if you have a man who 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.350
 know how to play because he will win 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 everybody is going to be pissed and fight 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.490
 and such and then ended the fun 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.310
 The next game on the list is one of mine. 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.619
 by what is a game that has 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.899
 for the perception of three of the 14 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.700
 absolutely everything for ps vita too 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.099
 moreover a great reason for me to maintain a 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
 perceived still alive because it serves 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.350
 very well for his face the ps vita 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.600
 game 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.430
 This day dies, and in fact, something to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.640
 happen enough for you to die 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.560
 You're going to fucking die exactly. 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.480
 that makes the game magical because 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.660
 he is very addictive 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.250
 I must have another 60 hours for what? 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.490
 probably could have dedicated more 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.750
 hours the employer check for problems logo 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.390
 closing this license we have football 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.860
 who never wanted to be the owner of a 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 soccer team, right? 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.400
 because it's just another engagement here only 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.140
 one more piece here it exists in 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.570
 truth since the time of elephant two 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.560
 then I'm old C's fucking my 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.320
 sky god 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.510
 but today the great exponent of this 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.570
 of this genre, right? 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.620
 I wanted to talk about football - even if 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.210
 probably already ruined 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.310
 some marriages out there 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.840
 Good. We're staying for what you like. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.120
 enter the favorite in leaves at will 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.650
 to share the video and give 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.750
 in the critic that he is with a 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.990
 visual new, it's beautiful, fucking people 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.990
 bug
