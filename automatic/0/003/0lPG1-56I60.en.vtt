like look you can just feel the power

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.130 
like look you can just feel the power
coming<00:03:49.580> from<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:50.030> box<00:03:50.239> or<00:03:50.510> Ecotec<00:03:51.110> engine

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
coming from that box or Ecotec engine

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.920 
coming from that box or Ecotec engine
this<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.160> VXR<00:03:52.670> by<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.880> way<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.269> basically

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
this is the VXR by the way and basically

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.360 
this is the VXR by the way and basically
the<00:03:54.110> difference<00:03:54.440> between<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.890> normal<00:03:55.160> course

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
the difference between the normal course

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.870 
the difference between the normal course
and<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.700> VXR<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.890> triangular<00:03:58.459> absorb

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
and the VXR is a is a triangular absorb

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.310 
and the VXR is a is a triangular absorb
that<00:03:59.000> now<00:03:59.150> no<00:03:59.450> longer<00:03:59.750> exists<00:04:00.170> because

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
that now no longer exists because

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.100 
that now no longer exists because
they've<00:04:00.530> put<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> different<00:04:00.860> bump<00:04:01.220> on<00:04:01.400> them<00:04:02.110> for

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
they've put a different bump on them for

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.229 
they've put a different bump on them for
the<00:04:03.260> logic<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.800> can't<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.400> can't<00:04:04.640> take<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:05.000> car
