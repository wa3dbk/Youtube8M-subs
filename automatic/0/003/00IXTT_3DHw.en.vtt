00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.090
 The first thing that he is going to do to us is to do 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.640
 a configuration of things 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.650

 this part of work 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.879

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.860
 let's continue and ready is successful the 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.670
 installation is going to be a relative and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.670
 quickly 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.850
 and we are ready with the shipment to a 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.850
 total modification of him 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.680
 of the world of warcraft interface 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.110
 we have here on this side of the chat as 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.700
 come and on the left side and on the side 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.870
 right we have the look that obviously 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.200
 it does not come out because we're not doing anything 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.750
 let's write very cool 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.519
 and here I do not know exactly what things 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.640
 We can change and I can move around 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.010
 example the character bar of the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.530
 We can see instances here that we are going 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.629
 to put it at the end is just to 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.190
 change distances as quickly as possible 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.430
 this recommended for the three nights 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.150
 for adidas for warriors and so on 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.530
 so 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.769
 Unofficially put our motives 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.769
 again and that's it, it's perfect 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:39.560

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.480
 the people who participated inside 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.269
 of the creation of this side we have the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.540
 general options moving to the side 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:59.349
 left of the screen make a 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.510
 automatic scale change the color of 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.849
 the edges and so on and on the right side 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.790
 we have the example menu we started with 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.730
 the name places that are the bars 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.609
 read up the characters and so on 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.450
 ours if we want to sell 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.189
 automatically if we have and we have 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.470
 repaired is that we are in a place 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.660
 to repair etc. various options 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.759
 when you look at it, we saw invite 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.880
 bags dating from expressed 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.889
 I recommend that you read before modifying 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.770
 to get out because we can achieve something in 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.570
 the side and an inference we see that they are and 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.990
 it also has a million options like 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.259
 come to the left side to the auras the light 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.009
 the action bar where you get the error 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:44.289
 tips the crops are what comes out in the 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:49.439
 lower part 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:51.809
 right of the screen the asses and the and 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:57.069

00:04:51.809 --> 00:05:01.960
 we have seen make a clock and ready and 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:05.469
 we are with the changes that we did well 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.219
 that 's the whole state based on 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:11.499
 spotlight not discovered much about 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:13.210
