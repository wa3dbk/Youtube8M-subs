engine<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.070> doesn't<00:01:11.280> consider<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
engine as well doesn't consider it a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.850 
engine as well doesn't consider it a
good<00:01:12.150> practice<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:17.820> couple<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.720> reasons<00:01:19.530> why

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
good practice a couple of reasons why

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.480 
good practice a couple of reasons why
this<00:01:19.920> happens<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:21.259> because<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> search

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
this happens one because the search

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
this happens one because the search
engines<00:01:23.820> might<00:01:24.030> consider<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.840> duplicate

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
engines might consider them as duplicate

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.060 
engines might consider them as duplicate
content<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.390> two<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.990> link<00:01:28.229> value<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> now

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
content and two the link value to it now

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
content and two the link value to it now
one<00:01:29.310> domain<00:01:29.490> might<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.329> few<00:01:30.509> backlinks

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
one domain might have a few backlinks

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.620 
one domain might have a few backlinks
coming<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.310> multiple<00:01:33.090> domains<00:01:33.390> might

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
coming in and multiple domains might

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
coming in and multiple domains might
have<00:01:33.869> different<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.439> backlinks<00:01:35.040> coming<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
have different back backlinks coming in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
have different back backlinks coming in
so<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.150> ten<00:01:36.600> links<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.170> every<00:01:37.560> domain

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so you have ten links for every domain

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.240 
so you have ten links for every domain
you<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.070> ten<00:01:39.000> domains<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:40.500> doesn't<00:01:40.920> add<00:01:41.220> up

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you have ten domains that doesn't add up

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
you have ten domains that doesn't add up
so<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.509> 10<00:01:42.780> domains<00:01:42.930> pointing

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so you have all that 10 domains pointing

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
so you have all that 10 domains pointing
to<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.860> single<00:01:44.189> site<00:01:44.540> even<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.750> that
