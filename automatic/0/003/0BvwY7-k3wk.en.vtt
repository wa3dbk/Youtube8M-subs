is a flexible sort of TPU style case
it's<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.250> cross<00:00:56.699> i<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.149> say<00:00:57.329> between

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's kind of a cross i would say between

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.069 
it's kind of a cross i would say between
like<00:00:57.930> polycarbonate<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.359> TPU<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.899> as

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like polycarbonate and TPU it's not as

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.460 
like polycarbonate and TPU it's not as
flexible<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:02.449> TPU<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.080> obviously

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
flexible as TPU but it's not obviously

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
flexible as TPU but it's not obviously
as<00:01:04.650> stiff<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:04.920> polycarbonate<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.119> super

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
as stiff as polycarbonate it's super

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
as stiff as polycarbonate it's super
thin<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.290> hopefully<00:01:07.439> make<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
thin as you can hopefully make out and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
thin as you can hopefully make out and
it<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> creates<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.540> cool

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
it kind of creates this really cool

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
it kind of creates this really cool
design<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.189> once<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.670> put<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
design or look once you put it on the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
design or look once you put it on the
back<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.869> ipod<00:01:13.200> touch<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.130> let's<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
back of the ipod touch so let's do that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
back of the ipod touch so let's do that
now<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> snap<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.439> back<00:01:16.650> cover<00:01:16.860> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
now just like a snap on back cover it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.649 
now just like a snap on back cover it's
good<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> button<00:01:18.150> side<00:01:18.330> first

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
good to go with the button side first

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
good to go with the button side first
and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.080> click<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> fits

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and then click it in you can see it fits

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
and then click it in you can see it fits
quite<00:01:21.000> tightly<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.720> once<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
quite tightly and once it's on it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
quite tightly and once it's on it
creates<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> mirror<00:01:23.909> effect<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.170> back

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
creates like a mirror effect on the back

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
creates like a mirror effect on the back
because<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> chrome<00:01:26.610> back<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.720> ipod

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
because of the chrome back of the ipod

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
because of the chrome back of the ipod
touch<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.040> translucent<00:01:29.820> finish<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
touch and the like translucent finish of

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
touch and the like translucent finish of
this<00:01:31.079> case<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.650> creates<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> mirror

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this case it creates like a mirror

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
this case it creates like a mirror
effect<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.570> back<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> ipod<00:01:34.200> touch

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
effect on the back of the ipod touch

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
effect on the back of the ipod touch
with<00:01:34.590> looks<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> cool<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.540> let's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
with looks really kind of cool so let's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
with looks really kind of cool so let's
take<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> look<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.710> ports<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
take a look at all the ports on the

of I don't know cut out here on the
bottom<00:02:21.710> this<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.210> using<00:02:23.600> a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
bottom this I think is for using a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.170 
bottom this I think is for using a
lanyard<00:02:24.020> I've<00:02:24.470> seen<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.070> certain<00:02:25.940> cases

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
lanyard I've seen this on certain cases

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.700 
lanyard I've seen this on certain cases
however<00:02:26.690> they<00:02:26.900> don't<00:02:27.050> give<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> lanyard

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
however they don't give you a lanyard

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.250 
however they don't give you a lanyard
with<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.250> case<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:28.820> not<00:02:29.420> sure<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.840> that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
with the case so not sure I like that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380 
with the case so not sure I like that
there<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> wish<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.070> wasn't<00:02:31.310> there<00:02:31.640> at<00:02:31.790> all<00:02:31.880> if

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
there I wish it wasn't there at all if

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.520 
there I wish it wasn't there at all if
you're<00:02:32.510> not<00:02:32.600> going<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.810> give<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.140> lanyard

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you're not going to give the lanyard

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.770 
you're not going to give the lanyard
don't<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.790> at<00:02:35.360> least<00:02:35.540> that's

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
don't have that there at least that's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.420 
don't have that there at least that's
what<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.930> think<00:02:36.050> this<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.800> it's<00:02:36.980> those<00:02:37.190> two

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
what I think this is for it's those two

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.160 
what I think this is for it's those two
little<00:02:37.580> holes<00:02:37.880> they<00:02:38.570> do<00:02:38.630> have<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.990> coolest

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
little holes they do have the coolest

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.530 
little holes they do have the coolest
logo<00:02:39.710> embossed<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> case<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:41.270> very

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
logo embossed in the case but it's very

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.360 
logo embossed in the case but it's very
subtle<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.320> don't<00:02:42.560> really<00:02:42.680> see<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.130> at<00:02:43.250> all

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
subtle you don't really see it at all

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.820 
subtle you don't really see it at all
overall<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.600> very<00:02:44.870> slim<00:02:45.290> case<00:02:45.590> it

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
overall this is a very slim case it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.200 
overall this is a very slim case it
offers<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.370> know<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.490> small<00:02:46.880> amount<00:02:47.150> of
