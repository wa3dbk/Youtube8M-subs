00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.450
 a cart the third clue is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.479
 extract this is the extra track jr of 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.759
 hot wheels when it appeared they did not know 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.630
 many details but now they are 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.540
 available front part back 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.910
 the fourth track is trap detox are 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.280
 track while last year 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.140
 these times I saw the announcement of the track 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 element revenge and I did not see it in 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.430
 existence until September 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.160
 this year I found a new track 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.530
 of hot wheels called tucson trap 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.590
 here is the image 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.170
 very similar to the previous one really what 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.259
 only different is that it has a toxoid 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.450
 a touch are both fuel I do not 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.610
 I hoped that this year there would also be 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.369
 track but it's been three years 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.429
 consecutive since 2008 in which 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 max this I choose wells come together though 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.800
 Of course, they have not been the only ones in the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.100
 2000 out 10 special edition cars 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.260
 max stern and for the 2004 the track left 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.660
 scorpion attack point this was the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.840
 I saw only hope that like the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.180
 Last year they come out again in September 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.400
 the figure of tucson is more complete 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.739
 that the raptor attack him mentor and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.570
 I believe that the one that turns is the top I am the 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.090
 goal is to give tucson to 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.610
 destroy it point this is all for now 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.130
 and if you think that the image of tucson in 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.470
 the previous photo is not appreciated very well 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.130
 here it is again but it is only 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.290
 note note I have already seen this track 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.540
 in more places but still they are not 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.150
 Many 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 the fifth track is machine track 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.120
 of 2012 as it has happened so 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.329
 consecutive since 2008 max is from him and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.849
 howell come together in 2012 this time 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.359
 to bring us a new track called the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.220
 revenge of machine makino s revenge 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.709
 as you will know the name of this track is 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.189
 same as the movie of 2011 where 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.659
 Macchi is not the only villain 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.239
 precisely in this track the objective 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.340
 beat machine is throwing a car 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.790
 that will have to travel the track that 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.920
 has a 360 turn and a curve for 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.280
 crash into machine at the moment 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.889
 just as he machined will be turning 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.889
 hindering the goal a 360 turn 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.930
 and a curve where the maki wing does not 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.810
 can take off the track is what there is 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.000
 what happens to get to machine includes 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.250
 a vehicle the track is very good and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.709
 definitely better than those that 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.439
 They have recently left Max Estelle 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.629
 the maki not included is the mode hey that 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.239
 has the same design as the figure of 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.050
 2012 air invasion machine to point 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.450
 includes a 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.790
 vehicle which is a model of the pair of 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.670
 vehicles of max this the base in danger 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.000
 that also came out in this 2012 so 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.430
 that I saw does not use batteries the packaging 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.740
 has on the side this excellent 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.930
 picture point this track joins the 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.060
 series of clues related to 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.030
 enemies of max this one who have come 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.540
 departing since 2009 which have 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.320
 been elements revenge 2009 trap detox 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.080
 2010 and extra gear 2011 are all very 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.900
 similar the machine comes to mark 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.110
 the difference being superior to the already 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.330
 mentioned was thought that this year 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.700
 would leave a clue related to 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.640
 machine but also a pack came out 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.950
 of max vehicles in this 2012 it 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.790
 he thought that he would only leave by vehicle 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.730
 track such as in 2008 by the way in 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.250
 this 2012 until now there has only been one 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.230
 pack of the base adventure in danger is 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.720
 has confirmed that there is another nucleus 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.910
 overloaded and it is expected that there is another 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.320
 more urban storm to well 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.920
 complete the three birds 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.200
 of this year the last sixth track is 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.660
 track hot wheels destruction of dread 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.990
 another of the expected products of the 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.180
 alliance between hot wheels and max this 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.820
 it's about a new track that involves 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.710
 to the main antagonist of the reboot to 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.890
 who should be exploited or let 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.890
 take off the track includes a vehicle
