00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.140
 we have to do that very well now 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.140
 they have been so long 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.760
 we want to go there today 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.640
 Percent the filer the fresh water single 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.790
 for Snake everywhere already seen ounces we want to tell something 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.790
 Scientist at a museum of natural history 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.670
 and his and then then live animals you see so here already 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.990
 A flood can be experienced that has been recognized so the heart beats pretty much 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.740
 violently 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.110
 We do not know that either 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 Most of what no one wants to see 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520
 are females 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 and the produce females and only in the fall so this season finds 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.580
 from time to time also humans 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.550
 and when the males mate with the females then they produce 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.210
 Andre Ayew and these eggs 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 that can come over the winter then we have a density Pelle 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.630
 and they can survive frost or dehydrate the water 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.120
 and we will 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.470
 the water fleas 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.100
 you can see that they are jumping through water so they do with them 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.610
 big antennas 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.600
 The teenie band does not tap off and that's what these little ones tie together 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 Creatures through the water 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.680
 and therefore names have cold water fleas 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.280
 the WasserflÃ¶he but these are not for us to speak 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.000
 the stinging feeling we were from beginning way 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.750
 he would now be a water flea to those 14 little crustaceans so here 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.820
 occupied by small seaplane 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.150
 Here you do not see the animal on the back of Federer 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.890
 Heartbeat 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.249
 when he sees it 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.249
 Like him this little bubble is the heart 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.539
 and the water fleas have no blood vessels but the blood cells the 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.869
 which floats through the inner of the body's fire to the heart 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.149
 and the heart gives the blood momentum and the device then here 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.939
 front race in the head 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.919
 like every woman and every water flea for the water fleas have a whole 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.309
 simple structure 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:38.369
 so they can not see any pictures but they can not hear them 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.299
 it's just a dark mask and here we see the shiny one 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.429
 So you have to have several plans 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.660
 from Kantar Health 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.309
 to recognize the direction 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:48.569
 Percent on which the light comes
