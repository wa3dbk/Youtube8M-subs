on the label here and they determine
whether<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> low<00:00:32.000> pressure<00:00:33.000> shutoff

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
whether you have a low pressure shutoff

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
whether you have a low pressure shutoff
application<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> high<00:00:34.710> pressure<00:00:35.040> shutoff

application or a high pressure shutoff
application<00:00:36.239> that's<00:00:37.050> important<00:00:37.620> because

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
application that's important because

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
application that's important because
when<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.309> remove<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.850> blue<00:00:39.059> cap<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:40.649> valve

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
when we remove this blue cap the valve

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.150 
when we remove this blue cap the valve
is<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:41.100> fitted<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> black<00:00:42.390> insert<00:00:43.160> if

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
is now fitted with this black insert if

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
is now fitted with this black insert if
you're<00:00:44.340> using<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.760> low<00:00:44.910> pressure<00:00:45.210> shutoff

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you're using the low pressure shutoff

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.190 
you're using the low pressure shutoff
application<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:47.370> recommend<00:00:47.960> removal<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
application we recommend removal of the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.850 
application we recommend removal of the
insert<00:00:50.629> using<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> high<00:00:52.079> pressure<00:00:52.440> shutoff

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
insert using the high pressure shutoff

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.840 
insert using the high pressure shutoff
application<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> insert<00:00:55.860> should<00:00:56.760> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
application and the insert should be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.799 
application and the insert should be
pushed<00:00:57.120> firmly<00:00:57.480> into<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:57.989> valve<00:00:59.059> using<00:01:00.059> your

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
pushed firmly into the valve using your

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.570 
pushed firmly into the valve using your
fingers<00:01:03.860> that's<00:01:04.860> how<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
fingers that's how to look in the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
fingers that's how to look in the
assemble<00:01:05.970> portion<00:01:07.610> we<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.619> supply<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
assemble portion we do then supply the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.899 
assemble portion we do then supply the
threat<00:01:11.040> tape<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> thread

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.779 

by<00:01:16.450> generous<00:01:16.960> amount<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:18.520> entire

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
by generous amount so that the entire

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:27.820 
by generous amount so that the entire
thread<00:01:19.180> length<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.630> covered

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.350 

maybe<00:01:28.830> libel

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.590 

and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:33.900> put<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> valve<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.270> tank

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and then put the valve to the tank

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.490 
and then put the valve to the tank
adapter<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> trough<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> tank<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:46.320> can

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
adapter in the trough the tank this can

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.520 
adapter in the trough the tank this can
be<00:01:46.590> screwed<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.370> up<00:01:47.520> by<00:01:47.730> hand<00:01:54.530> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
be screwed all the way up by hand and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:07.440 
be screwed all the way up by hand and
then<00:01:56.250> tighten<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:56.970> wrench

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.359 

so<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.140> early<00:02:08.410> phases<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.979> bottom<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
so the early phases the bottom of the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:33.699 
so the early phases the bottom of the
tank<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:13.590> take<00:02:14.590> your<00:02:14.770> float

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.110 

you<00:02:34.709> screw<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.190> all<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> way<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.910> leave

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you screw that all the way up and leave

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.100 
you screw that all the way up and leave
it<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.660> nut<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:39.599> tighten<00:02:39.959> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
it to the back nut and just tighten it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.610 
it to the back nut and just tighten it
firmly

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620
