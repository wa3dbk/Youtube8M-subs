00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.410
 shopping center digital life is a place 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.270

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.920
 interesting night from the store epic loot 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.259

 nastolki on video games you are heavy and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.949
 quite expensive at all price it 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.949
 a separate topic and rather sad 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.390
 the next store is dedicated to superhero and 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.880
 comics about them the truth is there certainly not 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100
 only they were just movie characters and 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.340
 TV series such as figurines from the game 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.340

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.900
 randomly falls for the figure 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.670
