there's a roll pin that sits through
that<00:03:00.220> shaft<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:00.820> catch<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:01.510> washer<00:03:01.930> then

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that shaft so catch that washer then

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.490 
that shaft so catch that washer then
your<00:03:02.470> spring<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:04.150> your<00:03:04.299> carbon<00:03:04.720> assembly

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
your spring then your carbon assembly

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.800 
your spring then your carbon assembly
that<00:03:05.620> goes<00:03:05.830> over<00:03:06.070> top<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.580> that<00:03:07.570> didn't

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
that goes over top and that didn't

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.440 
that goes over top and that didn't
really<00:03:07.840> work<00:03:08.049> because<00:03:08.470> my<00:03:08.940> oran<00:03:09.940> just<00:03:10.180> popped

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
really work because my oran just popped

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.500 
we've got a positive now I can actually
feel<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.230> shifting<00:03:30.830> see<00:03:31.310> how<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.580> hard<00:03:32.390> to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
feel it shifting see how it's hard to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.580 
feel it shifting see how it's hard to
shift

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590

that never happened when I got the motor

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.610 
that never happened when I got the motor
it<00:03:37.299> was<00:03:37.420> just<00:03:37.599> flopping<00:03:37.840> back<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.319> forth<00:03:38.499> so

let's<00:04:08.019> put<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.709> motor<00:04:09.219> on<00:04:10.590> Oh<00:04:11.669> mean<00:04:12.669> power<00:04:12.969> it

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
let's put a motor on Oh mean power it

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.599 
let's put a motor on Oh mean power it
now<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:14.079> powerhead<00:04:14.530> probably<00:04:14.949> won't<00:04:15.099> drop<00:04:15.310> on

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
now the powerhead probably won't drop on

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.810 
now the powerhead probably won't drop on
right<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.030> first<00:04:16.269> time<00:04:16.500> because<00:04:17.500> it's<00:04:17.889> not

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
right the first time because it's not

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.290 
right the first time because it's not
lined<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.320> what<00:04:20.410> we<00:04:20.530> need<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.799> do<00:04:20.949> is<00:04:21.940> shift

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
lined up so what we need to do is shift

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.499 
lined up so what we need to do is shift
it<00:04:22.449> into<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.690> gear<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.259> we'll<00:04:24.009> rotate<00:04:24.280> will<00:04:25.210> try

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
it into a gear and we'll rotate will try

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.540 
it into a gear and we'll rotate will try
and<00:04:25.570> rotate<00:04:26.020> would<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.530> be

gaskets<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:00.950> that's<00:05:01.950> not<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.190> good<00:05:02.340> son

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.950 

lift<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.720> back<00:05:08.900> off<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:14.180> makes<00:05:14.540> sense<00:05:14.720> to

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
lift the back off this makes sense to

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.230 
lift the back off this makes sense to
test<00:05:15.229> fit<00:05:15.470> these<00:05:15.650> things<00:05:16.030> before<00:05:17.030> they<00:05:17.120> go

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
test fit these things before they go

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.510 
test fit these things before they go
back<00:05:17.419> on<00:05:18.160> so<00:05:19.160> we'll<00:05:19.310> try<00:05:19.490> again<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:22.190> these

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
back on so we'll try again and these

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.090 
back on so we'll try again and these
motors<00:05:22.910> aren't<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.210> heavy<00:05:23.419> so<00:05:23.810> he<00:05:24.710> lifting

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
motors aren't that heavy so he lifting

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.530 
motors aren't that heavy so he lifting
the<00:05:25.190> power<00:05:25.400> head<00:05:25.639> back<00:05:25.820> on<00:05:26.030> it's<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.360> big

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
the power head back on it's not a big

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.100 
the power head back on it's not a big
deal<00:05:26.570> oh<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.740> see<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.160> problem

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.210 

this<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.830> actually<00:05:33.250> hitting

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
this is actually hitting

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.860 
this is actually hitting
mr.<00:05:36.220> Lee<00:05:36.340> designed

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.540 

and<00:05:39.500> if<00:05:39.680> that's<00:05:39.770> going<00:05:40.040> to<00:05:40.130> cause<00:05:40.310> us<00:05:40.340> some

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
and if that's going to cause us some

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.270 
and if that's going to cause us some
problems

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.310 

okay<00:05:43.880> we're<00:05:44.270> gonna<00:05:44.360> have<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.570> modify<00:05:44.810> that<00:05:45.110> gas

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
okay we're gonna have to modify that gas

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.890 
okay we're gonna have to modify that gas
cut<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:46.900> action

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.800 

so<00:05:51.500> against<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.949> trick<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.370> there<00:05:52.580> we<00:05:52.699> go<00:05:52.820> so

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
so against the trick is there we go so

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.360 
so against the trick is there we go so
that<00:05:53.870> gasps<00:05:54.169> this<00:05:54.380> is<00:05:54.440> wide<00:05:54.800> enough<00:05:54.919> for<00:05:55.070> us<00:05:55.280> to

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
that gasps this is wide enough for us to

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.129 
that gasps this is wide enough for us to
get<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.729> power<00:05:56.270> head<00:05:56.449> down<00:05:56.630> on<00:05:56.810> top<00:05:59.139> which

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
get the power head down on top which

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.890 
get the power head down on top which
we've<00:06:00.350> now<00:06:00.500> done<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:02.180> now<00:06:02.330> it's<00:06:02.570> just<00:06:02.690> a<00:06:02.870> matter

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
we've now done so now it's just a matter

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.350 
we've now done so now it's just a matter
of<00:06:04.330> screwing<00:06:05.330> in<00:06:06.669> there<00:06:07.669> are<00:06:07.759> seven<00:06:08.120> power

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
of screwing in there are seven power

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.270 
of screwing in there are seven power
head<00:06:08.660> screws<00:06:09.080> that<00:06:09.110> sit<00:06:10.150> underneath<00:06:11.150> here

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
head screws that sit underneath here

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.420 
head screws that sit underneath here
once<00:06:13.280> those<00:06:13.490> screws<00:06:14.169> are<00:06:15.169> in<00:06:15.410> our<00:06:15.710> power<00:06:16.160> head

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
once those screws are in our power head

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.930 
once those screws are in our power head
will<00:06:16.639> be<00:06:16.789> bolted<00:06:17.180> up<00:06:17.650> and<00:06:18.650> it's<00:06:19.460> just<00:06:19.639> a<00:06:19.759> matter

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
will be bolted up and it's just a matter

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.900 
will be bolted up and it's just a matter
of<00:06:20.060> putting<00:06:20.570> that<00:06:20.780> exhaust<00:06:21.169> housing<00:06:21.440> back<00:06:21.889> on

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.920 

essentially<00:06:28.910> this<00:06:29.030> motor<00:06:29.330> will<00:06:29.510> be<00:06:29.600> ready<00:06:29.810> to

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
essentially this motor will be ready to

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.990 
essentially this motor will be ready to
fire<00:06:30.230> up<00:06:32.860> so<00:06:33.860> we<00:06:34.190> don't<00:06:34.220> have<00:06:34.430> to<00:06:34.520> watch<00:06:34.639> me<00:06:34.669> do

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
fire up so we don't have to watch me do

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.840 
fire up so we don't have to watch me do
all<00:06:35.150> this<00:06:35.270> thick<00:06:35.510> you<00:06:35.630> can<00:06:35.780> cut<00:06:36.280> hi<00:06:37.280> everyone

powerheads<00:06:42.950> bolted<00:06:43.370> up<00:06:43.840> we've<00:06:44.840> got<00:06:44.870> the

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
powerheads bolted up we've got the

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.350 
powerheads bolted up we've got the
exhaust<00:06:45.350> housing<00:06:45.620> at<00:06:45.889> the<00:06:45.950> back<00:06:46.130> bolted<00:06:46.669> lower

exhaust housing at the back bolted lower
units<00:06:47.780> on<00:06:47.990> now<00:06:48.860> these<00:06:49.130> older<00:06:49.490> motors<00:06:49.790> the<00:06:49.880> only

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
units on now these older motors the only

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.400 
units on now these older motors the only
way<00:06:50.150> to<00:06:50.210> get<00:06:50.330> that<00:06:50.450> lower<00:06:50.660> unit<00:06:50.990> off<00:06:51.110> like<00:06:51.380> I

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
way to get that lower unit off like I

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.780 
way to get that lower unit off like I
explained<00:06:51.830> you<00:06:51.980> got<00:06:52.100> to<00:06:52.160> pull<00:06:52.310> the<00:06:52.370> power<00:06:52.520> head

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
explained you got to pull the power head

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.030 
explained you got to pull the power head
and<00:06:52.970> then<00:06:53.960> you<00:06:54.050> got<00:06:54.169> undo<00:06:54.440> that<00:06:54.560> shift<00:06:54.860> linkage

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
and then you got undo that shift linkage

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.700 
and then you got undo that shift linkage
and<00:06:55.940> unfortunately<00:06:56.630> it<00:06:56.930> is<00:06:57.020> the<00:06:57.200> newer<00:06:57.380> motors

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
and unfortunately it is the newer motors

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.800 
and unfortunately it is the newer motors
you<00:06:58.639> just<00:06:58.820> have<00:06:58.970> to<00:06:59.110> undo<00:07:00.110> your<00:07:00.520> undo<00:07:01.520> your

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
you just have to undo your undo your

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.210 
you just have to undo your undo your
lower<00:07:02.810> leg<00:07:03.050> bolts<00:07:03.410> and<00:07:03.590> the<00:07:03.650> leg<00:07:03.830> will<00:07:03.979> drop

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
lower leg bolts and the leg will drop

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.810 
lower leg bolts and the leg will drop
and<00:07:04.510> all<00:07:05.510> you<00:07:05.630> do<00:07:05.780> is<00:07:05.900> unbolt<00:07:06.490> your<00:07:07.490> shift

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
and all you do is unbolt your shift

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.460 
and all you do is unbolt your shift
linkage<00:07:08.000> but<00:07:08.630> on<00:07:08.750> these<00:07:08.900> the<00:07:09.139> shift<00:07:09.350> linkage

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
linkage but on these the shift linkage

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.110 
linkage but on these the shift linkage
was<00:07:09.800> a<00:07:09.830> solid<00:07:10.160> link<00:07:10.400> as<00:07:10.520> it<00:07:10.669> went<00:07:10.820> right<00:07:10.970> into

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
was a solid link as it went right into

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.240 
was a solid link as it went right into
the<00:07:11.690> shifter<00:07:12.440> into<00:07:12.560> the<00:07:12.620> power<00:07:12.860> head<00:07:13.040> so<00:07:13.190> the

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
the shifter into the power head so the
