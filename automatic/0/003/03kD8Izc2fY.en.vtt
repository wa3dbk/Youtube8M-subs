particular bar being used as a demo unit
at<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> particular<00:00:45.390> trade<00:00:45.870> show<00:00:46.140> but

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
at a particular trade show but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.410 
at a particular trade show but
essentially<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.700> looks<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> Liberty

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
essentially it looks like the Liberty

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
essentially it looks like the Liberty
bar<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> has<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:49.710> interesting

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
bar but it has some very interesting

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
bar but it has some very interesting
differences<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.480> course<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> center<00:00:52.230> area

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
differences of course in the center area

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
differences of course in the center area
we<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.039> LED<00:00:53.550> takedowns<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.840> course<00:00:55.050> on

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
we have LED takedowns and of course on

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.279 
we have LED takedowns and of course on
the<00:00:55.440> corners<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.329> LED<00:00:58.079> alley

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the corners here we also have LED alley

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
the corners here we also have LED alley
lights<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.609> interesting<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
lights what is interesting about this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
lights what is interesting about this
particular<00:01:00.899> corner<00:01:01.379> module<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
particular corner module is that this

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.080 
particular corner module is that this
happens<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.420> an<00:01:03.660> 18<00:01:04.489> diode<00:01:05.489> module<00:01:05.970> as

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
happens to be an 18 diode module as

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
happens to be an 18 diode module as
opposed<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> some<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> other<00:01:07.710> modules

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
opposed to some of the other modules

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
opposed to some of the other modules
that<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> Liberty's<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.150> come<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that the Liberty's have come with in the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.219

past<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.439> more<00:01:10.920> LEDs<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.510> outboard<00:01:12.840> area

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
past so more LEDs in the outboard area

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
past so more LEDs in the outboard area
to<00:01:13.619> give<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> stronger<00:01:14.369> kick<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.270> enter

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to give you a stronger kick as you enter

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.039 
to give you a stronger kick as you enter

an all blue light bar if that's what

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.859 
an all blue light bar if that's what
takes<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.299> fancy

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
takes your fancy
