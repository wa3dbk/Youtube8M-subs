00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.710
 now with the bass 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.639
 percent 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.419
 miki we went to this new section 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.879
 that we do not tend to the controversy, let's see 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.650
 it's something 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.180
 I'll take the second and the first step 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.169
 and reached states do not vote 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.169

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.509
 gladly 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.639
 immediately touched the third and the second in that way 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.279
 I'm going to these two bikes 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.279
 come back to these two and I go back to 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.139
 let's see with the bass 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.029
 bm 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.819
 not this section 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.819
 full let's see 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.419
 min 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.050
 and finally 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.050
 I do this 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.830
 haro the first force 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.399
 to these notes 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.270
 in which are octaves 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.069
 these promotoras and ended up in Latin 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.520
 is spanked in sections to see later 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.210
 min 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.379
 and it ended up in the hand 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:15.050
 but as it is this it is interesting not to be able to touch like that and that tarija flight 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.759
 can not dominate me and you can do it to me that you have to have patience not 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.249
 both mentally you take section by section until you can do it and 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:23.909
 listen to the melody
