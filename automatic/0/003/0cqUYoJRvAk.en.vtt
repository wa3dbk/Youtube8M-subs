you<00:03:18.190> use<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.340> chemical<00:03:18.609> I'm<00:03:18.940> writing<00:03:19.299> here

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
you use a chemical I'm writing here

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.729 
you use a chemical I'm writing here
because<00:03:19.750> it's<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.959> little<00:03:20.079> bit<00:03:20.260> lighter

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
because it's a little bit lighter

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.500 
because it's a little bit lighter
however<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.459> Marley<00:03:21.819> hair<00:03:22.060> looks<00:03:22.299> more

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
however the Marley hair looks more

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.930 
however the Marley hair looks more
realistic<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.349> holds<00:03:23.920> better<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.310> heavier<00:03:24.640> I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
realistic it holds better it's heavier I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.190 
realistic it holds better it's heavier I
just<00:03:25.150> think<00:03:25.299> it's<00:03:25.420> better<00:03:25.599> hair<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.019> use

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
just think it's better hair to use

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
what this hair was a struggle it's a

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.699 
what this hair was a struggle it's a
struggle<00:03:44.349> because<00:03:44.859> of<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.840> heaviness<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
struggle because of the heaviness of the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.319 
struggle because of the heaviness of the
hair<00:03:48.010> I'm<00:03:48.099> not<00:03:48.130> used<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.549> happen<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:49.030> sleep

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
hair I'm not used to happen to sleep

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.970 
hair I'm not used to happen to sleep
with<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> whole<00:03:49.690> bunch<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:49.959> hair<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.410> wasn't

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
with a whole bunch of hair I wasn't

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.039 
with a whole bunch of hair I wasn't
wrapping<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.639> at<00:03:51.790> first<00:03:52.000> at<00:03:52.269> night<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.510> wasn't

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
wrapping it at first at night I wasn't

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.470

taking<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.040> care<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.730> way<00:03:54.790> I'm

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480
