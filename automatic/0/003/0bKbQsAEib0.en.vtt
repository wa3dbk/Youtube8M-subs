developers and then you've got the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.900 
developers and then you've got the
playstation<00:00:44.040> saying<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
console most of the time i think people

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.080 
console most of the time i think people
just<00:00:48.930> buy<00:00:49.170> based<00:00:49.650> on<00:00:49.920> their<00:00:50.520> own<00:00:50.670> preferences

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
just buy based on their own preferences

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.450 
just buy based on their own preferences
not<00:00:51.630> necessarily<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.650> one<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> stronger

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
not necessarily because one is stronger

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.370 
not necessarily because one is stronger
than<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.630> it<00:00:54.900> can<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
than the other so it can be kind of

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.110 
than the other so it can be kind of
difficult<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.860> parse<00:00:56.220> through<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.790> know<00:00:56.880> what

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
difficult to parse through you know what

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
difficult to parse through you know what

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
really matters and recently i wrote a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.510

blog<00:00:59.790> post<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.480> did<00:01:00.630> a<00:01:00.660> video<00:01:00.950> about<00:01:01.950> do

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
graphics matter in a video game and I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.749 
graphics matter in a video game and I
talked<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> success<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.070> minecraft

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
talked about the success of minecraft

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.730 
talked about the success of minecraft
and<00:01:06.119> other<00:01:06.299> games<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.320> super

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and other games that don't have super

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.040 
and other games that don't have super
impressive<00:01:08.070> graphics<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.480> believe<00:01:09.930> if

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
impressive graphics because I believe if

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.930 
impressive graphics because I believe if
a<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.350> focuses<00:01:10.980> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.490> things

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
a game focuses on the right things

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.410 
a game focuses on the right things
graphics<00:01:12.870> start<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> matter<00:01:13.380> less<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.040> less

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
graphics start to matter less and less

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.180 
graphics start to matter less and less
so<00:01:15.420> I'm<00:01:15.540> somewhat<00:01:15.960> concerned<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.980> the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
so I'm somewhat concerned with the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.649 
so I'm somewhat concerned with the
recent<00:01:17.400> announcement<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.090> rise<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.630> the

thoroughly<00:01:27.930> enjoyed<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.650> reboot<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> Tomb

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
thoroughly enjoyed the reboot of Tomb

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.250 
thoroughly enjoyed the reboot of Tomb
Raider<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:30.000> thought<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.300> game<00:01:30.479> looked<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
Raider and I thought the game looked and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.860 
Raider and I thought the game looked and
played<00:01:31.460> brilliantly<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> xbox<00:01:33.330> one<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
played brilliantly on the xbox one and I

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.780 
played brilliantly on the xbox one and I
found<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.380> pretty<00:01:34.560> amusing<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.310> after<00:01:35.640> all

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
found it pretty amusing that after all

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.580 
found it pretty amusing that after all
the<00:01:35.940> bragging<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.840> arrogance<00:01:37.380> about

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the bragging and all the arrogance about

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.430 
the bragging and all the arrogance about
the<00:01:38.220> superior<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> better<00:01:39.659> graphics<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
the superior and better graphics of the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.640 
the superior and better graphics of the
ps4<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.850> had<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.590> inconsistent<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
ps4 it had more inconsistent and

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.920 
ps4 it had more inconsistent and
arguably<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.400> poor<00:01:44.790> performance<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
arguably a poor performance on that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740 
arguably a poor performance on that
platform<00:01:46.460> they<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.640> pushed<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> 60

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
platform they actually pushed it to 60

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
platform they actually pushed it to 60
frames<00:01:48.960> per<00:01:49.110> second<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:49.920> dip<00:01:50.159> way

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
frames per second and it would dip way

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160 
frames per second and it would dip way
down<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> graphics<00:01:51.869> were<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
down because the graphics were just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.170 
down because the graphics were just
beyond<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> could<00:01:52.950> run<00:01:53.130> stabili<00:01:53.760> now

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
beyond what it could run stabili now

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.510 
beyond what it could run stabili now
this<00:01:54.299> isn't<00:01:54.510> because<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.619> limitations<00:01:56.400> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this isn't because of the limitations of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.460 
this isn't because of the limitations of
the<00:01:56.670> PlayStation<00:01:57.240> 4<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> very<00:01:58.110> stout

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
the PlayStation 4 it is a very stout

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.800 
the PlayStation 4 it is a very stout
system<00:01:59.010> but<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.640> pushed<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.119> beyond<00:02:00.510> what<00:02:00.720> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
system but they pushed it beyond what it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.560 
system but they pushed it beyond what it
could<00:02:00.990> run<00:02:01.400> nice<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.700> stable<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.210> smooth<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
could run nice and stable and smooth so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
could run nice and stable and smooth so
when<00:02:03.930> you're<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.170> 60<00:02:04.619> frames<00:02:04.650> per<00:02:04.950> second<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
when you're at 60 frames per second and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399 
when you're at 60 frames per second and
it<00:02:05.580> dips<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:05.939> into<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> 40s<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.960> 30s<00:02:06.990> it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
it dips down into the 40s and 30s it's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.440 
it dips down into the 40s and 30s it's
very<00:02:07.590> noticeable<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.489> jitter<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
very noticeable little jitter on the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.530 
very noticeable little jitter on the
Xbox<00:02:10.049> one<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.530> ran<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.769> nice<00:02:11.189> stable<00:02:11.610> flat<00:02:12.090> 30

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
Xbox one it ran a nice stable flat 30

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.660 
Xbox one it ran a nice stable flat 30
and<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.319> don't<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.740> any<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.130> slow<00:02:14.459> down

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and so you don't have any that slow down

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.030 
and so you don't have any that slow down
or<00:02:14.849> any<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.030> those<00:02:15.150> any<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.959> those<00:02:16.020> drops<00:02:16.410> so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
or any of those any of those drops so

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.950 
or any of those any of those drops so
given<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.580> reality<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.480> was

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
given this reality I was

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.120 
given this reality I was
kind<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.140> shocked<00:02:19.440> when<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> read<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
kind of shocked when I read the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.920 
kind of shocked when I read the
announcement<00:02:20.670> about<00:02:20.730> pushing<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.300> xbox<00:02:21.690> one

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
announcement about pushing the xbox one

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.410 
announcement about pushing the xbox one
to<00:02:22.110> its<00:02:22.260> limit<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.940> can't<00:02:24.330> help

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
to its limit because I just can't help

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.320 
to its limit because I just can't help
but<00:02:24.660> ask<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.140> why<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:26.070> mean<00:02:26.610> sure<00:02:26.850> they're

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
but ask like why I mean sure they're

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.060 
but ask like why I mean sure they're
telling<00:02:27.720> us<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.020> developers<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.800> yet<00:02:28.950> to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
telling us that developers have yet to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.950 
telling us that developers have yet to
fully<00:02:29.250> show<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.270> know<00:02:30.660> what<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
fully show how you know what the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.140 
fully show how you know what the
hardware<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.410> capable<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:32.010> at<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.550> moment<00:02:32.700> um

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
hardware is capable of at the moment um

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150 
hardware is capable of at the moment um
and<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:33.900> that's<00:02:34.290> okay<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.040> know<00:02:35.130> I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and that's that's okay like you know I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.920 
and that's that's okay like you know I
guess<00:02:35.370> show<00:02:35.610> us<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.150> capable<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.630> more

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
guess show us if it's capable of more

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.230 
guess show us if it's capable of more
but<00:02:37.800> did<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> first<00:02:38.250> game<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.790> lack<00:02:38.970> any

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
but did the first game really lack any

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.600 
but did the first game really lack any
significant<00:02:39.960> graphical<00:02:40.530> quality<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:41.190> warrant

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
significant graphical quality to warrant

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
significant graphical quality to warrant
pushing<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.240> limits<00:02:42.630> they<00:02:43.170> push<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> limits

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
pushing the limits they push the limits

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.860 
pushing the limits they push the limits
on<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.160> ps4<00:02:44.490> with<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.420> first<00:02:45.600> Tomb<00:02:45.840> Raider

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
on the ps4 with the first Tomb Raider

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.930 
on the ps4 with the first Tomb Raider
and<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.440> result<00:02:46.800> was<00:02:46.890> any<00:02:47.130> consistent<00:02:47.730> frame

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and the result was any consistent frame

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.390 
and the result was any consistent frame
rate<00:02:48.180> performance<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.230> light<00:02:49.710> of<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:49.950> how

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
rate performance so in light of this how

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.920 
rate performance so in light of this how
can<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.850> confidence<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> same<00:02:51.720> thing

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
can we have confidence the same thing

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
can we have confidence the same thing
won't<00:02:52.110> happen<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.650> Xbox<00:02:53.100> one<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.460> mean<00:02:53.790> if

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
won't happen on the Xbox one I mean if

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
won't happen on the Xbox one I mean if
it's<00:02:54.390> mainly<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:54.960> hype<00:02:55.230> right<00:02:55.650> if<00:02:55.800> they're

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
it's mainly for hype right if they're

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.350 
it's mainly for hype right if they're
doing<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.610> brag<00:02:56.880> about<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
doing it so they can brag about the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.780 
doing it so they can brag about the
version<00:02:57.840> looking<00:02:58.560> better<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.220> then<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
version looking better and then it

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.910 
version looking better and then it
performs<00:03:00.270> poorer<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:01.260> could<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.830> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
performs poorer it could just be a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.470 
performs poorer it could just be a
marketing<00:03:02.490> mechanic<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.150> they're<00:03:03.300> just

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
marketing mechanic like they're just

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.820 
marketing mechanic like they're just
trying<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> convince<00:03:04.140> people<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.530> buy<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
trying to convince people to buy the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.110 
trying to convince people to buy the
game<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.400> that'll<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.670> really<00:03:05.820> frustrating

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
game and that'll be really frustrating

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.090 
game and that'll be really frustrating
for<00:03:06.630> those<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.930> us<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.080> by<00:03:07.380> then<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.920> put

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
for those of us that by then have to put

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.280 
for those of us that by then have to put
up<00:03:08.130> with<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.060> framerate<00:03:09.390> drops<00:03:09.960> I<00:03:10.140> mean

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
up with the the framerate drops I mean

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.320 
up with the the framerate drops I mean
the<00:03:10.590> real<00:03:10.740> problem<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.850> how

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the real problem with this is how

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.050 
the real problem with this is how
insignificant<00:03:12.920> graphics<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.130> become<00:03:14.610> now

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
insignificant graphics have become now

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
insignificant graphics have become now
keep<00:03:15.240> in<00:03:15.390> mind<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.870> didn't<00:03:16.740> say<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.860> graphics

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
keep in mind I didn't say that graphics

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.790 
keep in mind I didn't say that graphics
are<00:03:17.580> insignificant<00:03:18.080> but<00:03:19.080> how<00:03:19.230> insignificant

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
are insignificant but how insignificant

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.190 
are insignificant but how insignificant
they've<00:03:20.520> become<00:03:20.820> meaning<00:03:21.510> they<00:03:21.630> matter<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.960> lot

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
they've become meaning they matter a lot
