all<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> way<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.340> just

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
all the way up and it was it was just

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.509 
all the way up and it was it was just
coming<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.449> gangbusters<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> kept

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
coming out like gangbusters so I kept

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.820 
coming out like gangbusters so I kept
turning<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.420> where<00:00:27.830> I'll

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
turning it down this is where I'll

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.299 
turning it down this is where I'll
probably<00:00:29.130> pretty<00:00:29.369> much<00:00:29.550> keep<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:34.309> think

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
probably pretty much keep it I think

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:49.460 
probably pretty much keep it I think
it's<00:00:35.430> pretty<00:00:36.420> good<00:00:36.630> amount<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.079> smoke
