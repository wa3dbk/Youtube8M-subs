00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.969
 and it is said that everyone certainly 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 Camille I hope you are well 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.089
 for me it's really good because 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.710
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.890
 presentation of my village 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.340
 so i'm hdv 9 so it's a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.130
 village fashion farming me what 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 I use all the time almost I close 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.219
 all the time so you can see 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.950
 the shape that is quite nice 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.989
 this is the asvel in fact of this village 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
 it is rather for the troops 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.920
 terrestrial than airborne because you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 can see that I have nothing is not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.629
 protected but they are still well 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.219
 placed smart enough that actually 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.079
 the people they think not go go the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.210
 destroy and I'm going to show you the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.610
 defenses and kylie after so I'm going 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 talk at the same time that I loved them 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.219
 slows down so I like and slowed down 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 ground and after aerial idling 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.200
 had only two extensions so what there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 as usual one is con me destroyed 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.210
 my hdd so that's okay 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 so here is the accelerated fall it's not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 very interesting and here we will start to 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 attack by the auch believe well so the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 way there they destroyed me the age of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.890
 bicycles put a star and there he goes 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.170
 to attack me on the reserve of elixir because 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.409
 that there actually I had seen it I had it 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.689
 12:06 to make a change 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.170
 and after I alternate them with my quad 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.900
 and barbarian so here he swayed this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 breaks bricks if I'm wrong here 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 so there at the same time and he gets me out 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.990
 storm with his troops 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.110
 an hour ago reserves doors that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 fart and here we are with barbarians 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.460
 6 and archis 5 and walkyries that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.590
 can still go a grandma 39% 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.409
 it is unclear what is really huge 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.100
 but we can see clety this is very 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.280
 well placed more than an arc x that's it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.530
 so the land defense stella and there 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.240
 we will go to air defense 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.590
 so 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.920
 if you want to copy my village you 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.630
 can the screen screen thing or the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.330
 take a picture for example with your 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.820
 phone or your tablet and you them 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.600
 copy finally here's after you see you 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.040
 well you do your little thing 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.800
 so here it is there is still very 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.970
 my hdv he thought why not I 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.040
 will try to take him some 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.380
 resources 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.570
 I'm going to accelerate so here it is 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.400
 is small enough market I have a small 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.630
 mortar from a grassroots crowd what makes 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.300
 pity 4 3-4 levels not know 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.100
 because I believe three women brief 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.640
 it does not matter so me swing 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.640
 it's gyan 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.990
 so it's gyan accompanied by archers 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.540
 behind so there you can see that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.840
 I have an article of all kinds of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.290
 market turns cushioning cannon are 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.260
 so it's really cool 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.930
 a lot of damage so there price it goes 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.660
 see matt aut of two wizards throws and 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.010
 will swing his two dragons except that 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.380
 the anti nothing bah they are direct go 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.270
 on the anti nothing it is almost or anne 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.190
 shot the drag 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.940
 so here are the wizard scales I 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.190
 am not why 206 and after ben I 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.790
 would see well and that's it 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.690
 and that's it over 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.849
 and that's the end of this video 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.030
 tells you at the next set set to 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.030
 the study
