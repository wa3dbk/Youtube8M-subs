 hello to all this in the auction that you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 I propose today as you see is a lot 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.890
 simple but I made it just for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
 propose this effect which is called 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 tortoise effect is very simple from 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.699
 realize as they do everything 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
 the enamels we have to do very little 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 and this is very useful in backgrounds 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 obviously I have now realized it 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.650
 as you can see from the side on the nail can 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.329
 imagine being able to play with this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.350
 effect making come smaller 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.120
 maybe moving it diagonally or like 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 in short, you really like it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 very pretty anyway I hope so much 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.030
 that you like I send you a kiss and you 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.600
 I leave the tutorial 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 hello today applied to the base on all 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.899
 the mummies chosen native growth of the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.579
 pupa 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.890
 now I'm going to spread this beautiful green 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.739
 of the fabi of the favors fabi line that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.989
 it's called mint bubbles and I apply it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.610
 single color on all nails by two 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.030
 pass to get the most out of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030
 color 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.000
 this is the result with two passes of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.980
 nail polish to speed up the times of 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.900
 drying reserved for drops dries 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.700
 nail polish is enough one to two drops per 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.700
 nails depending on the length 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.920
 obviously they do not air dry 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.260
 they leave oily residues but I show you 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.110
 a daughter needs a white one 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.090
 france for emilia complete and a top 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.850
 coat fixed reais used those of 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.230
 dark and a little piece of parchment paper 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.250
 I put a few drops of white nail polish 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.280
 on parchment paper 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.130
 I proceed fingernail for an abundant meter 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.090
 fixer on the nail and when the nail polish 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.090
 and still wet 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.620
 i take with white with daughter e 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.330
 I make dots close together as you see 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.550
 on the enamel the other bathrooms are yes 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.180
 widen and when they approach 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.910
 drops is like creating gods 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 rectangles of course where you can 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.800
 play with your imagination to put 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.900
 the squares as more the dots as more 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.580
 you like them to clean dotter 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.170
 barter with enamel lever which of course 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.270
 to the hole the sponge full of solvent e 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.800
 then it will be enough to pass it over 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.980
 this is the result on all nails 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.270
 to further speed up the times 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.270
