for<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.520> sure<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> short

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
for me I'm sure so if you're a short

dancer<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.470> awesome<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> don't

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
dancer it's awesome you know you don't

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
dancer it's awesome you know you don't
want<00:01:41.970> something<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.570> hangs<00:01:42.720> too<00:01:42.990> long

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
want something that just hangs too long

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.429 
want something that just hangs too long
so<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:43.829> are<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.130> too<00:01:44.600> too<00:01:45.600> long<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.170> far<00:01:46.350> as

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
so these are not too too long as far as

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
so these are not too too long as far as
to<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> I'm<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.729> sorry<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> don't

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to do with and I'm so sorry but I don't

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
to do with and I'm so sorry but I don't
really<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> exact<00:01:49.170> measurements

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
really have the exact measurements

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
really have the exact measurements
that's<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> length<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.570> they

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that's what is the length I think they

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.510 
that's what is the length I think they
can<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:51.990> even<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> three<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> half<00:01:53.040> yard

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
can go even up to three and a half yard

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
can go even up to three and a half yard
