look<00:02:10.090> I'm<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.240> better<00:02:10.510> fighter<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.080> was<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> bad

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
look I'm a better fighter I was a bad

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800 
look I'm a better fighter I was a bad
fire<00:02:12.070> I<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.400> cause<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:13.210> got<00:02:13.390> called<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
fire I just cause I just got called a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.130 
fire I just cause I just got called a
good<00:02:13.960> shot<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:15.400> know<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.900> love<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.050> have

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
good shot and you know I love to have

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.780 
good shot and you know I love to have
that<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.410> watch<00:02:17.620> again<00:02:17.830> deafen<00:02:18.190> no<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> think<00:02:18.670> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that we watch again deafen no I think it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.430 
that we watch again deafen no I think it
makes<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.030> little<00:02:19.150> bit<00:02:19.330> easier<00:02:19.480> because<00:02:19.810> we

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
makes a little bit easier because we

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.870 
makes a little bit easier because we
both<00:02:20.620> without<00:02:20.800> him<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.460> think<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.730> fight

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
both without him and I think the fight

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.870 
both without him and I think the fight
will<00:02:22.000> probably<00:02:22.270> happen<00:02:22.390> easier<00:02:22.840> your<00:02:23.410> father

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
will probably happen easier your father

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.010 
will probably happen easier your father

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
watching him because it is a very lonely

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.190 
watching him because it is a very lonely
place<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.520> boxing<00:02:51.820> ring<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:52.870> so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
place be in a boxing ring you know so

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.310 
place be in a boxing ring you know so
yeah<00:02:53.440> keep<00:02:54.160> pyramid<00:02:54.550> key<00:02:55.360> 30<00:02:55.570> min<00:02:55.810> either<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
yeah keep pyramid key 30 min either is a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.090 
yeah keep pyramid key 30 min either is a
fight<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.650> was<00:02:56.830> open<00:02:57.100> coming<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.210> think

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
fight I was open coming and I think

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.200 
fight I was open coming and I think
maybe<00:03:00.100> in<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> couple<00:03:00.340> years<00:03:00.580> time<00:03:00.880> he<00:03:01.090> will

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
maybe in a couple years time he will

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.240 
maybe in a couple years time he will
probably<00:03:01.480> at<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.750> level<00:03:01.930> where<00:03:02.080> he<00:03:02.890> will<00:03:03.040> be

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
probably at a level where he will be

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.520 
probably at a level where he will be
will<00:03:04.180> be<00:03:04.210> probably<00:03:04.600> on<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.320> same<00:03:05.500> level

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
will be probably on the same level

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.170 
will be probably on the same level
losers<00:03:06.070> where<00:03:06.250> we'll<00:03:06.370> be<00:03:06.400> fighting<00:03:06.700> keep<00:03:06.970> like

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
losers where we'll be fighting keep like

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940 
losers where we'll be fighting keep like
Keith<00:03:07.390> Thurman<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:07.930> he<00:03:08.260> could<00:03:08.440> possibly<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
Keith Thurman so he could possibly be a

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.210 
Keith Thurman so he could possibly be a
pawn<00:03:09.250> in<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.520> future<00:03:09.870> definitely<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:12.040> at<00:03:12.160> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
pawn in the future definitely but at the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.470 
pawn in the future definitely but at the
moment<00:03:12.370> he's<00:03:12.700> fighting<00:03:13.060> on<00:03:13.120> line<00:03:13.240> on<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.450> card

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
moment he's fighting on line on the card

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.770 
moment he's fighting on line on the card
in<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:16.050> Santa<00:03:17.130> Andre<00:03:18.130> Ward<00:03:18.540> underwater<00:03:19.540> enemy
