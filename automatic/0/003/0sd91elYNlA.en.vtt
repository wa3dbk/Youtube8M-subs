alright so welcome to this morning's
truth<00:00:09.599> about<00:00:09.840> protein<00:00:10.260> video<00:00:10.950> today<00:00:11.610> we're

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
truth about protein video today we're

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.030 
truth about protein video today we're
talking<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.209> the<00:00:12.690> fruit<00:00:13.049> content<00:00:13.499> sorry

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
talking about the fruit content sorry

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160 
talking about the fruit content sorry
the<00:00:14.280> protein<00:00:14.639> content<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.179> fruit<00:00:15.389> mix<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.110> up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
the protein content of fruit mix that up

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.740 
the protein content of fruit mix that up
alright<00:00:16.950> so<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:18.000> completely<00:00:18.360> true<00:00:18.539> that

alright so it is completely true that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.600 
alright so it is completely true that
fruit<00:00:18.900> does<00:00:19.080> contain<00:00:19.410> protein<00:00:19.860> that<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.400> not<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
fruit does contain protein that is not a

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.000 
fruit does contain protein that is not a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of protein from just about any fruit

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.579 
of protein from just about any fruit
source<00:00:51.030> whether<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> normal<00:00:52.079> fruit<00:00:52.319> or<00:00:52.559> a

dried<00:00:53.399> fruit<00:00:53.760> source<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.929> looking<00:00:55.170> at

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
dried fruit source you're looking at

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.799 
dried fruit source you're looking at
well<00:00:55.440> over<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.739> thousand<00:00:56.159> calories<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.359> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
well over a thousand calories it's just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.889 
well over a thousand calories it's just
the<00:00:57.989> ratio<00:00:58.319> of<00:00:58.589> proteins<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.899> carbohydrates

the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.340 
the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates
that<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.589> indicative<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.129> most<00:01:02.670> fruit<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.929> if

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that is indicative of most fruit so if

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
that is indicative of most fruit so if
you<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:04.979> about<00:01:05.159> 20<00:01:05.580> grams<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you want to get about 20 grams of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.660 
you want to get about 20 grams of
protein<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.500> fruit<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.040> looking<00:01:08.369> eating

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
protein from fruit you're looking eating

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
protein from fruit you're looking eating
about<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> thousand<00:01:09.299> calories<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
about a thousand calories so it's not to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
about a thousand calories so it's not to
say<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.250> getting<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:12.119> total<00:01:12.600> daily

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
say that getting your total daily

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.389 
say that getting your total daily
protein<00:01:13.290> needs<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.619> fruit<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.890> impossible

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
protein needs from fruit is impossible

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.130 
protein needs from fruit is impossible
because<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.759> not<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.719> very<00:01:15.869> very

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because it's not it's just very very

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.249 
because it's not it's just very very
difficult<00:01:16.350> you'd<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:18.049> well<00:01:19.049> educated

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
difficult you'd have to be well educated

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.190 
difficult you'd have to be well educated
in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> area<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> protein<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.390> fruit<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.990> order

in the area of protein in fruit in order

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.389 
in the area of protein in fruit in order
to<00:01:22.289> do<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> you'd<00:01:22.829> have<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.189> very

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
to do it and you'd have to be very

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.179 
to do it and you'd have to be very
committed<00:01:23.969> to<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.299> cause<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:25.189> let's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
committed to the cause because let's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.679 
committed to the cause because let's
face<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> food<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> be

face it that's a lot of food to be

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
face it that's a lot of food to be
consuming<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.890> concern<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.520> getting

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
consuming my one concern about getting

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.120 
consuming my one concern about getting
all<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.509> protein<00:01:31.259> from<00:01:31.409> fruit<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.859> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
all of your protein from fruit is a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.529 
all of your protein from fruit is a
relatively<00:01:32.609> low<00:01:32.820> amount<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> branched-chain

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
relatively low amount of branched-chain

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.599 
relatively low amount of branched-chain
amino<00:01:33.600> acids<00:01:34.289> if<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.560> available<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.159> fruit

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
amino acids if it's available in fruit

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.480 
amino acids if it's available in fruit
it's<00:01:36.420> very<00:01:36.689> difficult<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.320> find<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:38.399> about

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it's very difficult to find just about

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.599 
it's very difficult to find just about
any<00:01:38.880> fruit<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.570> contains<00:01:39.960> well<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:41.579> than

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
any fruit that contains well more than

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.760 
any fruit that contains well more than
one<00:01:42.000> gram<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> granting<00:01:42.990> me<00:01:43.049> haces<00:01:43.259> combined

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
one gram of granting me haces combined

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
one gram of granting me haces combined
because<00:01:44.159> obviously<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.670> protein<00:01:45.030> source<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
because obviously the protein source is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
because obviously the protein source is
low<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.890> different<00:01:47.310> amino<00:01:47.579> acids<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
low so as is different amino acids you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.289 
low so as is different amino acids you
have<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> eat<00:01:48.570> about<00:01:48.750> 13<00:01:49.380> peaches<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:51.119> better

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
have to eat about 13 peaches to better

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.240 
have to eat about 13 peaches to better
get<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> gram<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> half<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.770> gratitude

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
get about a gram and a half of gratitude

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.169 
get about a gram and a half of gratitude
amino<00:01:53.579> acids<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.149> obviously<00:01:55.939> eating<00:01:56.939> 13
