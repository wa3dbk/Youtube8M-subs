00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
end of the video so let's get this

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.529 
end of the video so let's get this
review<00:00:22.769> started<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> first<00:00:23.730> category<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
review started the first category is the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
review started the first category is the
duration<00:00:24.839> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> ride<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.130> Griffin<00:00:26.910> has

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
duration of the ride and Griffin has

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.839 
duration of the ride and Griffin has
about<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.750> two<00:00:28.169> minute<00:00:28.380> ride<00:00:28.710> duration<00:00:29.339> and<00:00:29.640> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
about a two minute ride duration and so

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
about a two minute ride duration and so
it<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.359> getting<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.929> six<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:31.919> with

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
it is getting a six my thing with

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650 
it is getting a six my thing with
Griffin<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> even<00:00:33.000> though<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.240> about<00:00:33.300> two

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Griffin is even though it's about two

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660 
Griffin is even though it's about two
minutes<00:00:33.870> long<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.289> feels<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> really

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
minutes long it feels like a really

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
minutes long it feels like a really
short<00:00:35.940> ride<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.539> it<00:00:36.989> has<00:00:37.500> its<00:00:37.800> drop-in

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
short ride because it has its drop-in

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
short ride because it has its drop-in
Illman<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:39.660> into<00:00:39.840> another

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
Illman and then it goes into another

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
Illman and then it goes into another
droppin<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.860> woman<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.969> feels

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
droppin in woman and then it just feels

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.630 
droppin in woman and then it just feels
like<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.480> done<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.050> feels<00:00:43.309> shorter<00:00:44.309> than<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
like it's done it feels shorter than it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
like it's done it feels shorter than it
actually<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> retrospect<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.680> has

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
actually is but in retrospect it has

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.910 
actually is but in retrospect it has
over<00:00:47.640> 3,000<00:00:48.359> feet<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.690> track<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.530> certainly

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
over 3,000 feet of track so it certainly

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
over 3,000 feet of track so it certainly
could<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.309> longer<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:51.270> still<00:00:51.660> getting

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
could be longer but you're still getting

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.420 
could be longer but you're still getting
two<00:00:52.109> minutes<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> ride<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> which

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
two minutes of ride out of it which

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.610 
two minutes of ride out of it which
actually<00:00:53.879> isn't<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.210> bad<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.260> feels<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
actually isn't that bad it just feels a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
actually isn't that bad it just feels a
lot<00:00:55.739> shorter<00:00:56.010> than<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.609> actually<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
lot shorter than it actually is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
lot shorter than it actually is
next<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> speed<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.500> Griffin<00:00:58.920> goes<00:00:59.039> 71

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
next up is the speed in Griffin goes 71

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.069 
next up is the speed in Griffin goes 71
miles<00:00:59.940> per<00:01:00.120> hour<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.480> course<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.929> has

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
miles per hour and of course that has

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
miles per hour and of course that has
reset<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> bottom<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> first<00:01:02.309> drop<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
reset the bottom of the first drop so

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.580 
reset the bottom of the first drop so
Griffin<00:01:03.179> is<00:01:03.269> getting<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.660> seven<00:01:04.050> that's<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
Griffin is getting a seven that's a

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.859 
Griffin is getting a seven that's a
pretty<00:01:04.890> solid<00:01:05.190> speed<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.270> let's<00:01:06.479> talk<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
height of Griffin and of course Griffin

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.929 
height of Griffin and of course Griffin
is<00:01:08.790> 205<00:01:09.659> feet<00:01:10.140> tall<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> tallest<00:01:11.369> ride

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
is 205 feet tall it is the tallest ride

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.800 
is 205 feet tall it is the tallest ride
in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> park

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
in the park

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
in the park
it<00:01:12.869> does<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> tallest<00:01:14.100> drop<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it does not have the tallest drop in the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
it does not have the tallest drop in the
park<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.270> belongs<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> polished<00:01:16.259> chariot

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
park that belongs to a polished chariot

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.609 
park that belongs to a polished chariot
which<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.939> 210<00:01:17.939> feet<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.320> tallest

which is 210 feet but it is the tallest

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.499

station<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:29.760> kind<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.180> bummer

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
station and it's kind of a bummer

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.909 
station and it's kind of a bummer
because<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.079> Busch<00:03:31.349> Gardens<00:03:31.650> we're

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
because this is Busch Gardens we're

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.229 
because this is Busch Gardens we're
talking<00:03:32.159> about<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.370> should<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.699> having<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.090> lot

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
talking about it should be having a lot

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.059 
talking about it should be having a lot
more<00:03:33.540> theming<00:03:34.019> than<00:03:34.169> what<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.470> actually<00:03:34.500> has

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
more theming than what it actually has

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.240 
more theming than what it actually has
so<00:03:35.669> Griffin<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.209> getting<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.689> 1<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.349> has<00:03:37.409> slight

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so Griffin is getting a 1 it has slight

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.390 
so Griffin is getting a 1 it has slight
theming<00:03:38.939> but<00:03:39.299> barely<00:03:39.959> any<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.829> really<00:03:41.189> only

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
theming but barely any the really only

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.849 
theming but barely any the really only
theme<00:03:41.879> that<00:03:42.120> there<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.449> is<00:03:42.689> in<00:03:42.959> its<00:03:43.530> name

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
theme that there is is in its name

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.189 
theme that there is is in its name
Griffin<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:45.329> time<00:03:45.479> for<00:03:45.509> an<00:03:45.780> overall

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
Griffin so now it's time for an overall

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.849 
Griffin so now it's time for an overall
score<00:03:46.650> what<00:03:47.579> did<00:03:47.759> I<00:03:47.849> think<00:03:47.909> of<00:03:48.239> Griffin<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.959> like

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
score what did I think of Griffin I like

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.039 
score what did I think of Griffin I like
this<00:03:50.220> rollercoaster<00:03:50.669> it<00:03:51.329> is<00:03:51.540> good<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.019> is

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
this rollercoaster it is good it is

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.270 
this rollercoaster it is good it is
super<00:03:52.680> fun<00:03:52.919> it's<00:03:53.189> super<00:03:53.759> smooth<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.659> very

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
super fun it's super smooth it's very

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.710 
super fun it's super smooth it's very
rewritable<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.549> it's<00:03:56.819> just<00:03:57.000> fun<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.329> it's

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
rewritable and it's just fun and it's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.969 
rewritable and it's just fun and it's
one<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.930> those<00:03:57.989> coasters<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.590> want<00:03:58.859> to

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
one of those coasters that you want to

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.039 
one of those coasters that you want to
sit<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.340> all<00:03:59.579> three<00:03:59.909> rows<00:04:00.180> just<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.720> see<00:04:00.900> how

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
sit in all three rows just to see how

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.659 
sit in all three rows just to see how
they<00:04:01.259> differ<00:04:01.500> even<00:04:01.799> though<00:04:01.979> you<00:04:02.040> know<00:04:02.280> that

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
they differ even though you know that

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.789 
they differ even though you know that
first<00:04:03.060> row<00:04:03.359> is<00:04:03.599> obviously<00:04:04.169> gonna<00:04:04.319> be<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> best

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
first row is obviously gonna be the best

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.499 
first row is obviously gonna be the best
it's<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.129> different<00:04:05.459> experience<00:04:05.819> just<00:04:06.180> sitting

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
it's a different experience just sitting

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.990 
it's a different experience just sitting
on<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:07.319> winged<00:04:07.709> seat<00:04:08.159> as<00:04:08.340> opposed<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.729> sitting

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
on a winged seat as opposed to sitting

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.939 
on a winged seat as opposed to sitting
in<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.419> middle<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.109> in<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.470> back<00:04:10.650> row

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
in the middle and in the back row

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.429 
in the middle and in the back row
because<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.669> has<00:04:11.790> slight<00:04:12.180> stadium<00:04:12.750> seating<00:04:13.079> it

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
because it has slight stadium seating it

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.710 
because it has slight stadium seating it
gives<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:13.979> slightly<00:04:14.430> different<00:04:15.120> experience

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
gives a slightly different experience

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.740 
gives a slightly different experience
not<00:04:16.199> much<00:04:16.590> but<00:04:16.979> slightly<00:04:17.519> different<00:04:17.759> and<00:04:18.389> so

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
not much but slightly different and so

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.439 
not much but slightly different and so
Griffin<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.440> getting<00:04:19.829> an<00:04:19.979> 8<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.060> an

Griffin is getting an 8 this is an
awesome<00:04:21.750> coaster<00:04:22.470> my<00:04:22.830> only<00:04:23.219> complaint<00:04:23.580> really

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
awesome coaster my only complaint really

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.719 
awesome coaster my only complaint really
is<00:04:24.450> about<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.110> duration<00:04:25.889> I<00:04:26.099> talked<00:04:26.610> about

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
is about the duration I talked about

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.760 
is about the duration I talked about
that<00:04:27.090> as<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.539> first<00:04:27.870> thing<00:04:28.020> I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
that as the first thing I

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.920 
that as the first thing I
feel<00:04:28.949> like<00:04:29.129> this<00:04:29.400> coaster<00:04:29.879> was<00:04:30.150> too<00:04:30.479> short

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
feel like this coaster was too short

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.779 
feel like this coaster was too short
it's<00:04:31.289> one<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.590> those<00:04:31.740> things<00:04:32.009> that<00:04:32.220> yes<00:04:32.490> it's<00:04:32.699> a

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
it's one of those things that yes it's a

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.640 
it's one of those things that yes it's a
great<00:04:32.970> ride<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:33.840> after<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.169> first<00:04:34.379> time<00:04:34.530> you

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
great ride but after the first time you

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.499 
great ride but after the first time you
ride<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:34.979> you're<00:04:35.099> kind<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.340> like<00:04:35.490> wait<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
ride it you're kind of like wait that

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.869 
ride it you're kind of like wait that
was<00:04:36.629> it<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:37.050> mean<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.710> not<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.340> wasn't<00:04:38.639> a

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
was it I mean it's not that it wasn't a

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.240 
was it I mean it's not that it wasn't a
fantastic<00:04:39.659> ride<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.139> wish<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.979> was<00:04:41.220> a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
fantastic ride I just wish that it was a

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.520 
fantastic ride I just wish that it was a
bit<00:04:41.729> longer<00:04:42.120> it'd<00:04:42.780> be<00:04:42.990> nice<00:04:43.199> if<00:04:43.229> it

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
bit longer it'd be nice if it

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.680 
bit longer it'd be nice if it
incorporated<00:04:44.099> some<00:04:44.550> other<00:04:44.789> elements<00:04:45.360> however

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
incorporated some other elements however

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.570 
incorporated some other elements however
it's<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:46.020> dive<00:04:46.259> coaster<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:46.889> not<00:04:47.099> meant<00:04:47.430> to

it's a dive coaster it's not meant to
it's<00:04:48.060> pretty<00:04:48.569> much<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.780> one-trick<00:04:49.560> pony<00:04:50.009> and

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
it's pretty much a one-trick pony and

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.309 
it's pretty much a one-trick pony and
there's<00:04:50.759> many<00:04:51.000> one-trick<00:04:51.539> ponies<00:04:51.900> out<00:04:52.050> there
