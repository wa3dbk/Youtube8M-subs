00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.830 
is if you have it loaded point it and
then<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.769> push<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.949> roll<00:04:20.130> fast<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.970> that's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
then you push it roll fast and that's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.450 
then you push it roll fast and that's
your<00:04:21.989> firing<00:04:22.229> mechanism<00:04:22.919> essentially

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
your firing mechanism essentially

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.939 
your firing mechanism essentially
there's<00:04:23.699> no<00:04:23.880> other<00:04:24.080> like<00:04:25.080> button<00:04:25.590> oppression

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
there's no other like button oppression

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.890 
there's no other like button oppression
or<00:04:25.979> anything<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.400> all<00:04:27.180> right<00:04:27.330> next<00:04:27.660> up

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
or anything like that all right next up

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.610 
or anything like that all right next up
we<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.590> ruptor<00:04:29.900> all<00:04:30.900> right<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.260> a<00:04:31.380> ruptor

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
we have a ruptor all right in a ruptor

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.790 
we have a ruptor all right in a ruptor
what<00:04:32.040> he<00:04:32.160> does<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.760> mean<00:04:33.389> he's<00:04:33.990> just<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.380> red

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
that he shoots it looks like an

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.010 
that he shoots it looks like an
arrowhead<00:05:02.729> here<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:04.100> on<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.160> back<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.669> red

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
all the arm moves too so the shooting

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.920 
all the arm moves too so the shooting
arm<00:05:13.889> moves<00:05:14.070> up<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.400> down<00:05:14.539> that's<00:05:15.539> pretty<00:05:15.690> cool

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
arm moves up and down that's pretty cool

arm moves up and down that's pretty cool
and<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.590> goes<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:16.919> far<00:05:17.160> but<00:05:18.320> that's<00:05:19.320> pretty

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
and it goes so far but that's pretty

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.710 
and it goes so far but that's pretty
awesome<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.610> fired<00:05:20.820> it<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.030> same<00:05:21.210> way<00:05:21.419> as

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
awesome and you fired it the same way as

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.360 
awesome and you fired it the same way as
rattlesnake<00:05:22.320> you<00:05:22.470> just<00:05:22.680> push<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:22.979> out<00:05:23.190> like

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
rattlesnake you just push it out like

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.570 
rattlesnake you just push it out like
that<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.789> let<00:05:24.270> your<00:05:24.389> firing<00:05:24.600> mechanism<00:05:25.580> all

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
that and let your firing mechanism all

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.810 
that and let your firing mechanism all
right<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.060> next<00:05:27.270> one<00:05:27.510> is<00:05:28.580> freeze<00:05:29.580> blade

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
right and the next one is freeze blade

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.120 
right and the next one is freeze blade
whoops<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.750> he's<00:05:31.020> got<00:05:31.200> little<00:05:31.440> skates<00:05:31.889> here

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
whoops and he's got little skates here

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.480 
whoops and he's got little skates here
and<00:05:32.190> ice<00:05:32.460> blades<00:05:32.789> and<00:05:34.039> always<00:05:35.039> holding<00:05:35.370> his

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
and ice blades and always holding his

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.010 
and ice blades and always holding his
hand<00:05:35.669> out<00:05:35.760> he<00:05:35.910> has<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.030> little<00:05:36.150> kind<00:05:36.450> of<00:05:36.510> scepter

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
hand out he has a little kind of scepter

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.409 
hand out he has a little kind of scepter
that<00:05:37.260> he<00:05:37.320> shoots<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.710> guess<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:39.120> he's<00:05:39.240> another

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
that he shoots I guess so he's another

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.500 
that he shoots I guess so he's another
shooter<00:05:40.490> and<00:05:41.490> that's<00:05:41.970> going<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> be<00:05:42.330> his

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
shooter and that's going to be his

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.640 
shooter and that's going to be his
little<00:05:42.720> toy<00:05:43.289> power<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:44.910> his<00:05:45.150> his<00:05:45.840> blades<00:05:46.229> are

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
little toy power but his his blades are

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.879 
little toy power but his his blades are
adjustable<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:49.050> that's<00:05:49.169> kind<00:05:49.410> of<00:05:49.440> cool<00:05:49.590> but

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
adjustable so that's kind of cool but

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.830 
adjustable so that's kind of cool but
he's<00:05:50.490> going<00:05:50.639> to<00:05:50.729> fire<00:05:51.000> just<00:05:51.389> like<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.690> other

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
he's going to fire just like the other

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.700 
he's going to fire just like the other
two<00:05:52.080> did<00:05:53.389> so<00:05:54.389> if<00:05:54.510> you<00:05:54.630> have<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.870> loaded<00:05:54.960> get<00:05:55.530> to

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
two did so if you have it loaded get to

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.320 
two did so if you have it loaded get to
shoot<00:05:55.889> out<00:05:56.039> like<00:05:56.070> this<00:05:56.430> well<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:56.910> listened<00:05:57.240> to

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
shoot out like this well I listened to

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.290 
shoot out like this well I listened to
the<00:05:57.450> work<00:05:57.570> as<00:05:57.720> well<00:05:58.789> unlike<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.820> other<00:06:00.060> ones

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
the work as well unlike the other ones

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.490 
the work as well unlike the other ones
they<00:06:00.450> didn't<00:06:00.630> give<00:06:00.750> me<00:06:00.780> enough<00:06:00.870> room<00:06:01.260> on<00:06:01.349> the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
they didn't give me enough room on the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.409 
they didn't give me enough room on the
very<00:06:01.680> end<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.099> it<00:06:02.430> doesn't<00:06:02.729> like<00:06:02.880> pop<00:06:03.180> out<00:06:03.389> like

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
very end so it doesn't like pop out like

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.810 
very end so it doesn't like pop out like
you<00:06:03.840> think<00:06:04.320> it<00:06:04.440> should<00:06:04.650> all<00:06:05.520> right<00:06:05.639> guys<00:06:05.760> and
