does<00:01:45.650> have<00:01:45.860> some<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.460> few<00:01:46.940> but<00:01:47.660> barely<00:01:48.050> any<00:01:48.440> you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
does have some a few but barely any you

does have some a few but barely any you
see<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:49.640> sauteing<00:01:50.120> up<00:01:50.420> here<00:01:50.690> right<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.200> you

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
see I'm sauteing up here right so you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.250 
see I'm sauteing up here right so you
can<00:01:51.800> see<00:01:52.070> how<00:01:52.340> it's<00:01:52.580> going<00:01:53.080> starting<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.170> look

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
can see how it's going starting to look

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.500 
can see how it's going starting to look
good<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:54.800> give<00:01:55.190> them<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.610> little<00:01:55.940> brown<00:01:56.240> I'm

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
good I just give them a little brown I'm

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.990 
good I just give them a little brown I'm
not<00:01:56.720> I'm<00:01:57.560> not<00:01:57.620> really<00:01:57.890> cooking<00:01:58.250> them<00:01:58.430> through

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
not I'm not really cooking them through

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.120 
not I'm not really cooking them through
it<00:01:59.690> totally<00:02:00.050> depends<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.890> what<00:02:01.010> you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
it totally depends on you and what you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.610 
it totally depends on you and what you
want<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.400> do<00:02:01.610> what<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.090> want<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.360> why<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.320> want

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
want to do what you want to why you want

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.340 
want to do what you want to why you want
this<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:04.010> come<00:02:04.220> together<00:02:04.750> now<00:02:05.750> looks<00:02:05.990> good<00:02:06.140> for

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
this to come together now looks good for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.000 
this to come together now looks good for
me<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.070> now<00:02:07.190> I'm<00:02:07.250> going<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.430> break<00:02:07.610> my<00:02:07.790> egg<00:02:09.010> pop

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
me so now I'm going to break my egg pop

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.170 
me so now I'm going to break my egg pop
it<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.310> there<00:02:11.500> now<00:02:12.500> what<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.830> usually<00:02:13.070> do<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.820> in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
it in there now what I usually do is in

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
it in there now what I usually do is in
the<00:02:14.390> egg<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.900> break<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.530> yolk<00:02:15.770> up<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.430> reason

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
the egg I break the yolk up the reason

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.580 
the egg I break the yolk up the reason
is<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.030> makes<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.360> flow<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.660> little<00:02:17.840> better<00:02:18.050> now

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
is it makes it flow a little better now

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.290 
is it makes it flow a little better now
one<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.860> things<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.430> do<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.940> want<00:02:20.150> to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
one of the things you can do you want to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.190 
one of the things you can do you want to
make<00:02:20.990> sure<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.620> well<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.959> could

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
make sure you do it well is you could

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.020 
make sure you do it well is you could
break<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.650> egg<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.070> scramble<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.880> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
break the egg and scramble it in a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.640 
break the egg and scramble it in a
container<00:02:26.390> first<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.380> then<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.160> use<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
container first and then I just use the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.490 
container first and then I just use the
kind<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.740> gravity<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.880> know<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
kind of gravity and you know this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.070 
kind of gravity and you know this
centrifugal<00:02:33.500> force<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.959> move<00:02:35.959> it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
centrifugal force here just move it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.080 
centrifugal force here just move it
around<00:02:36.200> I've<00:02:36.739> got<00:02:36.890> my<00:02:37.040> spatula<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:38.230> fill<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.380> in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.949 

you<00:02:44.090> can<00:02:44.239> see<00:02:44.420> it's<00:02:44.540> starting<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.810> come

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
you can see it's starting to come

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.460 
you can see it's starting to come
together<00:02:46.120> let<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.270> cook<00:02:47.600> let<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.080> harden

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
together let this cook let this harden

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.100 
together let this cook let this harden
up<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.709> little<00:02:48.890> bit<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.780> then<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:51.080> to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
up a little bit and then I'm going to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.310 
up a little bit and then I'm going to
flip<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.440> over<00:02:51.739> put<00:02:52.100> on<00:02:52.910> my<00:02:53.090> cheese<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.170> we're

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
flip it over put on my cheese and we're

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.660 
flip it over put on my cheese and we're
all<00:02:54.410> done<00:02:54.620> we've<00:02:55.010> got<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.220> great<00:02:55.520> little

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.060 

I<00:03:02.480> actually<00:03:03.480> learned<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.020> learn<00:03:04.560> how<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.770> do

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
I actually learned to learn how to do

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.910 
I actually learned to learn how to do
this<00:03:05.250> with<00:03:05.720> with<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> little<00:03:07.080> spatula<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
this with with the little spatula in the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.130 
this with with the little spatula in the
hotels<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.150> travel<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.690> lot<00:03:09.840> for

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
hotels because I travel a lot for

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.350 
hotels because I travel a lot for
business<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.490> always<00:03:11.940> look<00:03:12.180> at<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
business and so you always look at the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360 
business and so you always look at the
little<00:03:12.540> omelet<00:03:13.290> bars<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.950> that's<00:03:14.100> what<00:03:14.250> they

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
little omelet bars and that's what they

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.520 
little omelet bars and that's what they
would<00:03:14.520> use<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.080> home<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.260> I

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
would use and I got it home and I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.010 
would use and I got it home and I
started<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.040> use<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.480> made<00:03:18.630> life<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.990> lot

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
started to use it and it made life a lot

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.880 
started to use it and it made life a lot
easier<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.690> see<00:03:21.840> now<00:03:22.020> we're<00:03:22.710> pretty

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
easier so you can see now we're pretty

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.590 
easier so you can see now we're pretty
much<00:03:23.100> cooked<00:03:23.400> up<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.910> need<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.660> flip<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.170> over

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
much cooked up I need to flip it over

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.850 
much cooked up I need to flip it over
this<00:03:27.600> takes<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.990> little<00:03:28.140> bit<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.410> practice<00:03:28.830> to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
this takes a little bit of practice to

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.040 
this takes a little bit of practice to
be<00:03:29.040> able<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.490> but<00:03:30.270> look<00:03:30.780> at<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
be able to do this but look at that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.300 
be able to do this but look at that
looks<00:03:31.560> pretty<00:03:31.830> good

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
looks pretty good

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.640 
looks pretty good
I'm<00:03:32.550> not<00:03:32.760> Rachael<00:03:33.150> Ray<00:03:33.390> but<00:03:33.720> hey<00:03:33.930> we're<00:03:34.470> we're

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
getting there

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.410 
getting there
this<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.330> again<00:03:36.960> very<00:03:37.470> low<00:03:37.800> calorie<00:03:38.310> all<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
this is again very low calorie all the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.350 
this is again very low calorie all the
cheese<00:03:39.810> adds<00:03:40.290> about<00:03:40.710> 60<00:03:41.280> calories<00:03:41.520> almost<00:03:42.120> you

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
cheese adds about 60 calories almost you

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.060 
cheese adds about 60 calories almost you
know<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.990> adds<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.230> good<00:03:43.410> chunk<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:43.950> on

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
know and adds a good chunk of it on

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.700 
know and adds a good chunk of it on
there<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:45.270> what<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.510> do<00:03:45.630> here<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.320> after<00:03:46.680> I

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
there and what I do here is after I
