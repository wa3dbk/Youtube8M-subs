00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.449
 we are at feimafe 2013 at the 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.020
 triumph that launches in brazil the machine of 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.119
 fiber laser cut 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.270
 manufactured in Switzerland is best suited for 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.500
 industries in the agricultural sector 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.510
 electronic and food 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.120
 works with plates of different 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.270
 ferrous and non-ferrous materials as 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.850
 copper and brass from 1 to 20 mm 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.129
 thickness being up to 10 mm 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.020
 ideal production thickness 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.170
 working with 6 millimeters of 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.140
 thickness the speed is 2.8 meters 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.500
 per minute with one millimeter aluminum 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 the speed of 60 meters per minute 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.730
 the repeatability of 0.03 millimeters and the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.759
 maximum displacement is 140 meters per 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.130
 minute due to fiber-guided laser 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.740
 the so-called true dial developed by 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.469
 the machine itself consumes three 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.020
 times less electricity compared to 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.070
 machines with laser technology 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.290
 co2 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.850
 another says it was developed by 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.340
 triumph is a laser unit where light 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.470
 laser is generated through the reflection of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.220
 diodes and an eye size disk 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.159
 human 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.590
 this disk it is resistant to reflections 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.290
 bringing stability to safety 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.630
 too large for the customer also 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.150
 maintenance of the machine and the laser is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.040
 by a single technician thus facilitating 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.720
 identification of problems and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.650
 reducing response times and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.320
 machine repair 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.330
 the equipment has a one-year warranty and the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.159
 company offers maintenance plans 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.229
 after this period 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.229
