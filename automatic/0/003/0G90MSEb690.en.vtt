this is the other one I was looking for

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.800 
this is the other one I was looking for
right<00:03:30.739> here<00:03:30.770> this<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.120> one<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.270> think<00:03:32.630> this

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
right here this is the one I think this

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.870 
right here this is the one I think this
was<00:03:33.080> about<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.290> rarest<00:03:33.770> one<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.730> whole

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
was about the rarest one in the whole

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
was about the rarest one in the whole
box<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.570> was<00:03:35.780> looking<00:03:36.110> through<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:37.040> was

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
box so I was looking through and it was

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.310 
box so I was looking through and it was
a<00:03:37.190> brand<00:03:37.489> new<00:03:37.640> box<00:03:37.910> nobody<00:03:38.420> else<00:03:38.540> had<00:03:38.780> felt<00:03:39.080> it

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
a brand new box nobody else had felt it

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.979 
a brand new box nobody else had felt it
through<00:03:39.650> yet<00:03:39.890> I'm<00:03:40.760> pretty<00:03:41.060> sure<00:03:41.270> maybe<00:03:41.690> a

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
through yet I'm pretty sure maybe a

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.960 
through yet I'm pretty sure maybe a
couple<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.980> them<00:03:43.070> but<00:03:43.190> for<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.489> most<00:03:43.670> part<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
couple of them but for the most part of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.360 
couple of them but for the most part of
felt<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.570> was<00:03:44.660> brand<00:03:44.900> new<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.260> this<00:03:46.190> guy

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
felt like it was brand new and this guy

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.160 
felt like it was brand new and this guy
was<00:03:46.610> about<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.970> hardest<00:03:47.209> one<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.420> find<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.989> to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
was about the hardest one to find and to

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.350 
was about the hardest one to find and to
like<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:49.130> there's<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.370> three<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.090> them

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
like I think there's like three of them

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.199 
like I think there's like three of them
to<00:03:50.480> have<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:50.870> 2<00:03:51.620> by<00:03:51.769> 2<00:03:51.830> tile<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.880> fill

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
to have this 2 by 2 tile so you fill

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.420 
to have this 2 by 2 tile so you fill
that<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.600> lot<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:54.080> then<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.070> gotta<00:03:55.220> make

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
that in a lot but then you gotta make

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.210 
that in a lot but then you gotta make
sure<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.700> ain't<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> old<00:03:56.060> man<00:03:56.360> you<00:03:57.070> make<00:03:58.070> sure

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
sure it ain't the old man you make sure

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.890 
sure it ain't the old man you make sure
you<00:03:58.310> got<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.550> short<00:03:58.850> legs<00:03:59.060> now<00:03:59.390> this<00:03:59.600> one<00:03:59.780> I
