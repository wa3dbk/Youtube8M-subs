alright<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.200> obviously<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.010> really

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
alright and obviously I don't really

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.369

like<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.329> healthy<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the only things that I Verne would say

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.880 
the only things that I Verne would say
that<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.570> affected<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.140> hair<00:01:34.350> but

that you know is affected my hair but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 
that you know is affected my hair but
it's<00:01:35.040> still<00:01:35.189> continue<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> grow<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.329> still

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's still continue to grow it's still

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.450
