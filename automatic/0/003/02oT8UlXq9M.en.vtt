00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 three friends and welcome back to ours 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.700
 small 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 the purpose of the games directory d 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 then we grew up 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.840
 also playing as cadillacs and dinosaurs 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.390
 where together with friends you went to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.460
 around beating of the ten imagine the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 our surprise of ours is ours 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.150
 claudio when we found out that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.660
 in the launch line up of julia there was 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 this blade is a game that for 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.290
 graphics for gameplay etc. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 it really seemed really really really 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.160
 exciting main problem that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 he practically comes out immediately 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.559
 is that it is a very slow game and it is not 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 at all optimized for oria 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.160
 to be honest this is not a 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.230
 slow play the game would be too 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.059
 rather hectic and would also be 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.059
 very very playable if only 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.859
 answered but is better answered a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.379
 this for this reason 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.030
 we have not a few slowdowns 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.490
 almost half the boys frame 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.290
 but maybe not even more because 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 because we will find ourselves defeating hordes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.509
 of enemies using moves 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 special and a bit like the league of 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.060
 legends you take these things with 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.070
 big pliers but you have these 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.330
 special moves to use 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.210
 really very nice even if you play 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 in two but I would have liked it very much 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.550
 have the opportunity to learn more about 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.350
 gameplay but to define it problem that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.530
 arrive certain points where there are 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 many enemies and slows down it becomes 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.250
 unplayable to Susa 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.440
 obviously we don't feel like guys 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.900
 to say that the game is bad because I play 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.640
 it's actually very cool especially 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.770
 the fact that you can play in the cup 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 with a friend that there is a lot of depth 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 and combat you think of each 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 backbone of each file is made 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.759
 dorsal to a special magic attack 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.530
 you can attack you can pack a parry 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.450
 shots of enemies and this in this type 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.090
 there is almost no game so you can 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.590
 also repair very nice you have the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.810
 double jump 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.910
 you have lots of alternative spells from 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.470
 use with the aforementioned are potions 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.480
 which you can use with darts 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.610
 usually the objects you use with 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.200
 those in short, the game is everything 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 respect and we would like him to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.630
 developers put let's say a little 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.370
 more attention in 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.830
 of optimization especially with a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.840
 system that I think can give, we could 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.880
 come back and we have seen with him 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.280
 I want to say if he can make to say 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.080
 turn stable shadow gun 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.630
 then it means that any game 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.670
 could tend to run well if 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
 only it was optimized perugia 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.660
 obviously this is the launch line-up 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.030
 are the first julia games 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.250
 there is that to expand the stock of securities there 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.209
 is it some game it presents 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.650
 of the flaws 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.140
 we do not want to see, however, absolutely 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.820
 more these things in the future especially if 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.810
 we talk about games that potentially 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.810
 they are children
