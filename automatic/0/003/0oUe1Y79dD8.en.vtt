00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.740
 how do you see the image GEPA 620 image damage once the operation of 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.299
 to this device 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.379
 At first we see the touch-screen here 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.779
 a press statement 3 inch tft touchscreen so it is not like that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.249
 sensitive as capacitive touchscreens therefore respond to pressure 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.029
 Nevertheless, the device gives a feedback by vibration which makes me relative 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.960
 works well 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.969
 We'll take a look at the operation now, using the device 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.590
 Unlock Natureum on the button 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.520
 and the animal feed castle 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.510
 and now we have the first opportunity us our home screen 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.720
 establish 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.590
 the device offers a bucket of hands to use Android homescreen 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.620
 or the Algae home-screen 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.620
 that was tense once 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.260
 Homescreen started again here who have listed more programs here 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 we have two levels once left a man to the right 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.850
 and these tests in the middle 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.440
 if we press here on this cottage 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.540
 we can switch between m people with their screen Trittin to Marcel Jenni 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.180
 would now be their standard program arranged 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.570
 at the bottom 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.060
 Percent under invocation Zion 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.980
 yes me the phone book 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.460
 Messages 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.200
 the programs 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.510
 We also arranged small programs 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.580
 the speech is known 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.170
 now on the levels 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.310
 move between ages 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.810
 There are always more envy around three levels, but we do 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.060
 can 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.590
 keep going left or draw 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 this always repeats itself as in a loop 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370
 we go back to the Android homescreen 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.600
 Here are the possibilities for our programs 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.610
 and on demand men from this filing third 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.520
 nearly 400 force 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 up and down one has seen that Haag sometimes 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.400
 Who will start me after this Cup which always back to 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.409
 at full program leads or out of the menu 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.409
 Depending on which application started 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.089
 that's how it works 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.809
 and we have the button in the middle here 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.339
 here we can for example Widgets Programs application on ours 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.289
 Arrange background 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.989
 Baumann we have the opportunity to search here 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.399
 What happens there on Google 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.599
 we also have the opportunity to set up our background so 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 to take a picture from the gallery or background gallery 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.619
 also announced to make further adjustments 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.979
 and we have the opportunity here and to look for notification 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:54.269
 her is always listed when, for example, an SMS has arrived at 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 Call in absence is with them and so on and so forth 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.559
 I can also call on the whole thing 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.239
 by simply 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 pull from top to bottom here 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.969
 Here, by Alan Simon I was this individual background 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:12.839
 establishes 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.999
 while, for example, this watch stopped 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.939
 if you push for a long time 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.879
 then you can take this 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.879
 and arrange them in the background as often as you like 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.729
 exactly the same goes with Google too 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.409
 and every time I was in the district three shoulders dubbed the game machine 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.029
 something 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.519
 if I want to arrange a new widget then by not long on the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.280
 background 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.519
 and no ornamental linking widgets Ortner 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.329
 or background images 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.779
 "I just want to go out a bit now 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.579
 Now we have more options for example Trolley Ear 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.909
 we have several calendars 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 Picture frame analog clock and so on and so forth 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.139
 I want different radio ORF 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.209
 and now I have here his application with which I can start the radio 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.619
 works, of course, only if the suitcases are connected 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.419
 Herrmann sees her husband can set up the background individually 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:17.079
 City rerouting a widget 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.389
 for example, the sticky notes 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.580
 that's really useful 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.669
 for countries with aces how to send a text message 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.749
 certainly the possibilities are also to press SMS MMS 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.620
 then my sms functions will open 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.599
 I press enter new message 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.080
 Now here's my feeling a recipient can enter eerie the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.629
 Possibility to type a message 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.860
 when I heard the gig I support mine here 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.150
 phone keypad 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.979
 I can once on the Rhine Gabriel club and off 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.610
 I can turn on their upper case 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.039
 and if I can not climb numbers here anyway 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.949
 Enter special characters 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.069
 I go back 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.069
 and be a text everywhere 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.089
 with input Irish, this is really very good 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:14.770
 the device helps me 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.179
 Again, there is feedback when I'm on a cup of sugar 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.939
 So writing works fine 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.939
 Final Ana without input help 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.460
 and that works fine 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.320
 Of course you can also with DAX sets the tattoo the SMS write that works 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.159
 probably much faster 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.159
 then try the TuS again 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.889
 You can see here I get too 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.889
 proposals 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.669
 the pressure point is really good 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.900
 In addition, the keyboard is illuminated 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.740
 You can see that in Hennig as well as you can write in the dark 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.590
 and Jamil filmed it 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.710
 Ulrike goal to navigate 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.809
 and that means around 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.129
 to jump down between the words 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.060
 but it also works in the menu 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.060
 if I go back now 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.300
 can be found here 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.830
 I can test here with the case 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.830
 go through the menu 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.680
 that works very well 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.210
 I'm also looking for something 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.540
 then I'll choose directly
