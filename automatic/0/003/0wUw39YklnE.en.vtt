questions
how<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:33.849> is<00:05:34.119> just<00:05:34.899> the<00:05:35.139> game<00:05:35.349> based<00:05:35.649> upon

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
how you is just the game based upon

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.739 
how you is just the game based upon
whether<00:05:36.699> you're<00:05:36.849> playing<00:05:36.999> cooperatively<00:05:37.599> or

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:37.749 
whether you're playing cooperatively or

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.209 
whether you're playing cooperatively or
not<00:05:37.899> it<00:05:38.319> seems<00:05:38.529> like<00:05:38.619> if<00:05:38.799> you<00:05:38.859> have<00:05:38.949> the<00:05:39.039> same

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
not it seems like if you have the same

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.709 
not it seems like if you have the same
number<00:05:39.489> of<00:05:39.639> enemies<00:05:40.029> in<00:05:40.059> each<00:05:40.209> area<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:40.659> you

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
number of enemies in each area and you

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.209 
number of enemies in each area and you
have<00:05:40.809> no<00:05:40.959> sequel<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.349> kill<00:05:41.499> of<00:05:41.619> enemies<00:05:41.949> it<00:05:42.099> has

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
have no sequel to kill of enemies it has

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.549 
have no sequel to kill of enemies it has
become<00:05:42.639> a<00:05:42.669> little<00:05:42.939> too<00:05:43.089> easy<00:05:43.329> well<00:05:44.259> that's

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:44.559 
become a little too easy well that's

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.889 
become a little too easy well that's
very<00:05:44.679> interesting<00:05:45.009> but<00:05:45.489> we<00:05:45.729> are<00:05:46.029> dynamically

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:46.899 
very interesting but we are dynamically

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.289 
very interesting but we are dynamically
looking<00:05:47.349> at<00:05:47.499> you<00:05:47.799> and<00:05:47.829> the<00:05:48.219> way<00:05:48.369> you<00:05:48.399> play<00:05:48.939> and

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:49.299 
looking at you and the way you play and

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:51.059 
looking at you and the way you play and
the<00:05:49.539> level<00:05:49.839> that<00:05:49.989> you<00:05:50.049> are<00:05:50.349> and<00:05:50.499> we're<00:05:50.679> just<00:05:50.949> in

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
the level that you are and we're just in

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.609 
the level that you are and we're just in
the<00:05:51.099> difficulty<00:05:51.639> around<00:05:51.939> that<00:05:52.179> now<00:05:53.049> I<00:05:53.079> what<00:05:53.589> I

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:53.619 
the difficulty around that now I what I

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:54.809 
the difficulty around that now I what I
don't<00:05:53.979> want<00:05:54.219> to<00:05:54.339> do<00:05:54.459> is<00:05:54.579> make<00:05:54.609> it

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
don't want to do is make it

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.179 
don't want to do is make it
exponentially<00:05:55.539> harder<00:05:55.959> for<00:05:56.469> people<00:05:56.739> who<00:05:57.069> are

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:57.189 
exponentially harder for people who are

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.699 
exponentially harder for people who are
coming<00:05:57.339> in<00:05:57.639> so<00:05:58.389> i<00:05:58.689> think<00:05:59.019> the<00:05:59.109> traditional<00:05:59.679> way

00:05:59.699 --> 00:05:59.709 
coming in so i think the traditional way

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.579 
coming in so i think the traditional way
is<00:05:59.859> that<00:06:00.369> co-op<00:06:01.059> if<00:06:01.689> you've<00:06:01.959> got<00:06:02.199> someone

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
is that co-op if you've got someone

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.559 
is that co-op if you've got someone
co-op<00:06:02.979> in<00:06:03.219> you<00:06:03.549> now<00:06:03.729> you<00:06:03.789> increase<00:06:04.239> the<00:06:04.359> number

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
co-op in you now you increase the number

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.229 
co-op in you now you increase the number
of<00:06:04.599> creatures<00:06:04.869> carte<00:06:05.709> blanche<00:06:06.039> we<00:06:06.789> don't<00:06:06.939> do

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:07.239 
of creatures carte blanche we don't do

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:09.689 
of creatures carte blanche we don't do
that<00:06:07.449> we<00:06:07.749> look<00:06:08.079> at<00:06:08.229> your<00:06:08.469> level<00:06:08.739> we<00:06:09.369> look<00:06:09.579> at

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
that we look at your level we look at

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.179 
that we look at your level we look at
your<00:06:09.819> henchman's<00:06:10.299> level<00:06:10.689> and<00:06:10.929> we<00:06:11.739> can<00:06:11.919> bear

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
your henchman's level and we can bear

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.889 
your henchman's level and we can bear
the<00:06:12.369> two<00:06:12.579> we<00:06:12.729> sum<00:06:12.999> the<00:06:13.029> two<00:06:13.360> but<00:06:13.599> eventually

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:13.899 
the two we sum the two but eventually

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.799 
the two we sum the two but eventually
and<00:06:14.199> that<00:06:14.349> gives<00:06:14.589> us<00:06:14.769> what's<00:06:15.659> what<00:06:16.659> the

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:16.809 
and that gives us what's what the

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.389 
and that gives us what's what the
enemies<00:06:17.169> should<00:06:17.349> be<00:06:17.559> there<00:06:18.129> should<00:06:18.159> be

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:18.399 
enemies should be there should be

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.309 
enemies should be there should be
attacking<00:06:18.489> if<00:06:19.089> you're<00:06:19.539> particularly<00:06:19.959> good<00:06:20.169> at

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
attacking if you're particularly good at

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.779

combat<00:06:20.529> both<00:06:20.860> you<00:06:21.009> too<00:06:21.219> could<00:06:21.339> have<00:06:21.399> combat

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
combat both you too could have combat

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.789 
combat both you too could have combat
your<00:06:22.029> final<00:06:22.509> that<00:06:23.049> combats<00:06:23.439> going<00:06:23.619> to<00:06:23.679> be<00:06:23.769> a

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:23.799 
your final that combats going to be a

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.439 
your final that combats going to be a
little<00:06:23.919> bit<00:06:24.099> more<00:06:24.279> challenging<00:06:24.489> but<00:06:24.939> I<00:06:24.999> really

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
little bit more challenging but I really

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.439 
little bit more challenging but I really
want<00:06:25.689> to<00:06:26.379> make<00:06:26.619> sure<00:06:26.679> that<00:06:27.449> experienced

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
want to make sure that experienced

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.419 
want to make sure that experienced
gamers<00:06:28.719> can<00:06:29.169> play<00:06:29.469> with<00:06:29.709> people<00:06:30.099> who<00:06:30.219> haven't

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:30.429 
gamers can play with people who haven't

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:32.969 
gamers can play with people who haven't
played<00:06:30.719> role<00:06:31.719> playing<00:06:31.959> games<00:06:32.229> before<00:06:32.499> or<00:06:32.829> any

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
sort of games before that's why we

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.529 
sort of games before that's why we
really<00:06:35.109> paid<00:06:35.349> attention<00:06:35.379> to<00:06:35.859> this<00:06:36.039> camera

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
really paid attention to this camera

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.839 
really paid attention to this camera
it's<00:06:37.539> so<00:06:37.839> important<00:06:38.499> a<00:06:38.619> lot<00:06:38.979> of<00:06:39.189> people<00:06:39.489> will

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
it's so important a lot of people will

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.719 
it's so important a lot of people will
actually<00:06:40.149> end<00:06:40.419> up<00:06:40.779> doing<00:06:41.219> play<00:06:42.219> games<00:06:42.579> like

this<00:06:42.879> end<00:06:43.089> up<00:06:43.269> I<00:06:43.419> can't<00:06:43.659> it's<00:06:43.809> very<00:06:43.959> hard<00:06:44.169> for

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
this end up I can't it's very hard for

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.169 
this end up I can't it's very hard for
me<00:06:44.409> to<00:06:44.529> do<00:06:44.619> this<00:06:44.769> but<00:06:45.009> you<00:06:45.610> know<00:06:45.789> what<00:06:45.939> i<00:06:45.969> mean

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:46.179 
me to do this but you know what i mean

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:48.449 
me to do this but you know what i mean
is<00:06:46.239> if<00:06:46.749> you<00:06:47.019> give<00:06:47.289> them<00:06:47.319> a<00:06:47.619> controller<00:06:48.069> for

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:48.459 
is if you give them a controller for

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.519 
is if you give them a controller for
inexperienced<00:06:49.149> casual<00:06:49.719> players<00:06:49.959> will<00:06:50.169> end<00:06:50.349> up

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529 
inexperienced casual players will end up

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.279 
inexperienced casual players will end up
running<00:06:50.829> against<00:06:51.429> things<00:06:51.669> like<00:06:51.999> this<00:06:52.989> for

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
running against things like this for

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.249 
running against things like this for
hours<00:06:53.409> on<00:06:53.739> end<00:06:53.799> and<00:06:54.449> you<00:06:55.449> know<00:06:55.569> they'll<00:06:55.989> feel

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
hours on end and you know they'll feel

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.139 
hours on end and you know they'll feel
frustrated<00:06:56.979> so<00:06:57.159> we've<00:06:57.309> really<00:06:57.849> tried<00:06:58.029> to

00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:58.149 
frustrated so we've really tried to

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:59.969 
frustrated so we've really tried to
balance<00:06:58.419> this<00:06:58.749> so<00:06:58.989> that<00:06:59.110> anybody<00:06:59.409> can<00:06:59.769> play

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
balance this so that anybody can play

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.369 
balance this so that anybody can play
this<00:07:00.129> game<00:07:00.269> so<00:07:01.269> the<00:07:01.449> difficulty<00:07:01.899> does<00:07:02.079> change

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:02.379 
this game so the difficulty does change

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.259 
this game so the difficulty does change
but<00:07:02.589> it<00:07:02.619> doesn't<00:07:03.009> get<00:07:03.339> exponentially<00:07:04.059> harder

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.269 
but it doesn't get exponentially harder

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:07.559 
but it doesn't get exponentially harder
just<00:07:04.839> because<00:07:04.929> this<00:07:05.199> to<00:07:05.379> you
