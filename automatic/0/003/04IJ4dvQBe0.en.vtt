what's going on guys it's bryan and this
is<00:00:02.399> part<00:00:02.610> 14<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.270> my<00:00:03.360> pc<00:00:03.750> build<00:00:03.929> series<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> in

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
is part 14 of my pc build series and in

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.800 
is part 14 of my pc build series and in
this<00:00:05.009> video<00:00:05.190> i<00:00:05.400> will<00:00:05.640> be<00:00:05.759> wiring<00:00:06.089> everything

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
this video i will be wiring everything

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.290 
this video i will be wiring everything
together<00:00:07.639> this<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> part<00:00:09.000> I've<00:00:09.179> been

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
together this is the part I've been

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.640 
together this is the part I've been
worrying<00:00:09.480> about<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.840> most<00:00:10.019> because<00:00:10.380> as<00:00:10.559> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
worrying about the most because as you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.530 
worrying about the most because as you
can<00:00:10.679> see<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.610> already<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.910> huge<00:00:12.120> mess<00:00:12.389> of

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
can see it's already a huge mess of

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.870 
can see it's already a huge mess of
cables<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.170> case<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.889> hopefully<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.759> can

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
cables in the case but hopefully I can

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300 
cables in the case but hopefully I can
do<00:00:15.120> my<00:00:15.240> best<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.719> sort<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> clean<00:00:16.980> everything

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
do my best to sort of clean everything

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.730 
do my best to sort of clean everything
up<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> give<00:00:19.680> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
up so I'm not really going to give you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.080 
up so I'm not really going to give you
any<00:00:19.890> commentary<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.789> sort<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
any commentary I'm just going to sort of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.310 
any commentary I'm just going to sort of
plug<00:00:21.270> everything<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.080> show<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
plug everything in and then show you

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.650 
plug everything in and then show you
where<00:00:22.800> everything<00:00:22.830> goes<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> bit<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.150> for

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
where everything goes in a bit so for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.939 
where everything goes in a bit so for
most<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.900> these<00:00:25.019> things<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.380> will<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
most of these things I will have to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.279 
most of these things I will have to
refer<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> motherboard<00:00:27.480> manual<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
refer to the motherboard manual so I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.900 
refer to the motherboard manual so I
know<00:00:28.380> where<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> plug<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> front<00:00:29.670> panel

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
know where to plug in the front panel

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.470 
know where to plug in the front panel
indicators<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.720> things<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> here

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
power now on to the huge mess of cables

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.119 
power now on to the huge mess of cables
coming<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> power<00:00:43.800> supply<00:00:46.039> let<00:00:47.039> me

into the case or they're coming from the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.130 
into the case or they're coming from the
front<00:00:53.850> panel<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> case<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> e

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
front panel of the case and for the e

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.090 
front panel of the case and for the e
motherboard<00:00:58.140> power<00:00:58.379> we're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> need

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
motherboard power we're going to need

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.660 
motherboard power we're going to need
this<00:00:59.280> one

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.640 

move<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.850> around<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.440> one

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
move it around a little bit and this one

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:46.430 
move it around a little bit and this one
will<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:09.000> here

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.780 

okay<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.590> got<00:01:47.770> everything<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
okay so I got everything on the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.200 
okay so I got everything on the
motherboard<00:01:49.030> wired<00:01:49.660> up<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.050> front<00:01:50.260> panel<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
motherboard wired up the front panel the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.970 
motherboard wired up the front panel the
video<00:01:52.210> card<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.720> hard<00:01:53.020> drives<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.500> DVD<00:01:53.830> drive

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
video card the hard drives the DVD drive

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.040 
video card the hard drives the DVD drive
and<00:01:54.220> all<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.970> media<00:01:55.360> card<00:01:55.630> reader<00:01:55.690> all

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
and all that the media card reader all

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.200 
and all that the media card reader all
of<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.530> wired<00:01:56.860> up<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.090> actually

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
of that is wired up and this is actually

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.500 
of that is wired up and this is actually
the<00:01:58.510> back<00:01:58.660> side<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.110> case<00:01:59.290> where<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.510> so

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
the back side of the case where the so

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.120 
the back side of the case where the so
if<00:02:01.600> you're<00:02:01.750> looking<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.290> case<00:02:02.470> from<00:02:02.979> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
if you're looking at the case from the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.109 
if you're looking at the case from the
front<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.729> would<00:02:04.120> be<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.560> right<00:02:05.710> side

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
front this would be the the right side

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.219 
front this would be the the right side
so<00:02:07.119> I'm<00:02:07.330> actually<00:02:07.540> going<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.930> go<00:02:07.960> ahead<00:02:08.080> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
so I'm actually going to go ahead and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.020 
so I'm actually going to go ahead and
take<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.770> cover<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.550> put<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.880> is

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
take that cover and put it on this is

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.790 
take that cover and put it on this is
going<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.270> pretty<00:02:16.600> much<00:02:16.780> hide<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.350> mess<00:02:17.650> of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
going to pretty much hide the mess of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.449 
going to pretty much hide the mess of
cables<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:21.430> I

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
cables that we have here because I

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.650 
cables that we have here because I
didn't<00:02:21.820> go<00:02:21.910> modular<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.850> far<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.570> what

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
didn't go modular so so far this is what

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.160 
didn't go modular so so far this is what
the<00:02:25.780> inside<00:02:26.110> looks<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:27.900> let<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:28.959> go<00:02:29.080> ahead

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the inside looks like let me go ahead

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.840 
the inside looks like let me go ahead
and<00:02:29.320> see<00:02:29.709> what<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.920> looks<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.250> camera

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and see what it looks like on camera

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.740 
and see what it looks like on camera
that<00:02:31.120> looks<00:02:31.209> ok<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> go<00:02:34.720> ahead

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
that looks ok so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.360 
that looks ok so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:34.959> try<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.320> hide<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.620> as<00:02:35.890> many<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.280> these

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and try to hide it as many of these

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.310 
and try to hide it as many of these
cables<00:02:36.760> as<00:02:36.910> possible<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.720> don't<00:02:38.050> know<00:02:40.080> how<00:02:41.080> well

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
cables as possible I don't know how well

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.690 
cables as possible I don't know how well
it's<00:02:41.350> going<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.709> work<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:43.380> ok<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.130> think

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
it's going to work out ok so I think

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.080 
it's going to work out ok so I think
everything<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.510> wired<00:02:47.050> up<00:02:47.459> all<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.850> front

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
everything is wired up all the front

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.990 
everything is wired up all the front
stuff<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.660> USB<00:02:50.050> frequent<00:02:50.470> no<00:02:50.530> port<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.400> right

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
stuff the USB frequent no port is right

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.009 
stuff the USB frequent no port is right
here<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> plug<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:52.930> into<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.380> board

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
here I have to plug that into the board

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.140 
here I have to plug that into the board
the<00:02:56.019> video<00:02:56.260> card<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.650> plugged<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.130> for<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the video card is plugged in for the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.449 
the video card is plugged in for the
power<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.660> all<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.930> stuff<00:02:59.280> I'm<00:03:00.280> actually

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
power and all that stuff I'm actually

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.930 
power and all that stuff I'm actually
going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.910> move<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.680> rear<00:03:02.680> exhaust<00:03:03.010> fan<00:03:03.610> cable

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
going to move the rear exhaust fan cable

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.009 
going to move the rear exhaust fan cable
under<00:03:04.750> over<00:03:04.959> here<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.360> make<00:03:07.540> things<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
under over here just to make things a

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.960 
under over here just to make things a
little<00:03:08.110> more<00:03:08.260> neater

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.940 

and<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.660> know<00:03:13.780> what<00:03:13.990> this<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.320> not<00:03:14.500> too<00:03:14.740> bad<00:03:14.920> of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and you know what this is not too bad of

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.430 
and you know what this is not too bad of
a<00:03:15.130> case<00:03:15.370> i<00:03:15.610> have<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.300> many<00:03:16.330> wires<00:03:16.870> shoved<00:03:17.230> up

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
a case i have so many wires shoved up

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.540 
a case i have so many wires shoved up
into<00:03:18.220> these<00:03:18.340> extra<00:03:18.940> unused<00:03:19.750> drive<00:03:20.050> bays

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
into these extra unused drive bays

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.370 
into these extra unused drive bays
behind<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> back<00:03:21.850> plate<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.510> back<00:03:22.720> case

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
behind the back plate in the back case

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.710 
behind the back plate in the back case
cover<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.830> bunch<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.700> wires<00:03:24.850> everywhere<00:03:25.180> back

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
cover a bunch of wires everywhere back

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.630 
cover a bunch of wires everywhere back
there<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.800> is<00:03:26.920> pretty<00:03:27.010> much<00:03:27.190> all<00:03:27.400> people

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
there but this is pretty much all people

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.070 
there but this is pretty much all people
are<00:03:27.760> going<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.120> look<00:03:28.300> at<00:03:28.480> anyway<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:28.900> it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
are going to really look at anyway so it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:38.610 
are going to really look at anyway so it
appears<00:03:29.460> i<00:03:31.890> think<00:03:32.890> that's<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.170> finish

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
appears i think that's it so to finish

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.600 
appears i think that's it so to finish
this<00:03:38.830> off<00:03:39.390> take<00:03:43.500> side<00:03:44.500> panel<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.070> then<00:03:45.490> we're

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
this off take side panel and then we're

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.760 
this off take side panel and then we're
going<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.760> go<00:03:45.850> ahead<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.150> put<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.690> on<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:49.770> i

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
going to go ahead and put it on and i

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.160 
going to go ahead and put it on and i
only<00:03:51.280> put<00:03:51.430> one<00:03:51.490> pci<00:03:51.940> express<00:03:52.270> power<00:03:52.750> cable

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
only put one pci express power cable

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.310 
only put one pci express power cable
into<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.410> 16<00:03:54.370> pin<00:03:54.580> into<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:54.940> video<00:03:55.240> card<00:03:55.510> not

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
into the 16 pin into the video card not

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.930 
into the 16 pin into the video card not
sure<00:03:56.440> if<00:03:56.560> i<00:03:56.620> need<00:03:56.800> to<00:03:56.830> use<00:03:57.040> both<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.640> if<00:03:57.820> i<00:03:57.910> need

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
sure if i need to use both or if i need

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.310 
sure if i need to use both or if i need
to<00:03:58.090> use<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.360> one<00:03:58.660> that's<00:03:58.840> on<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.050> motherboard

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
to use the one that's on the motherboard

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.500 
to use the one that's on the motherboard
but<00:03:59.760> we'll<00:04:00.760> find<00:04:00.940> out<00:04:01.120> soon<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:04.360> actually

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
but we'll find out soon so it's actually

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.770 
but we'll find out soon so it's actually
really<00:04:04.990> it's<00:04:05.920> quite<00:04:06.400> tight<00:04:06.730> inside<00:04:06.940> actually

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
really it's quite tight inside actually

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.340 
really it's quite tight inside actually
a<00:04:09.120> pretty<00:04:10.120> proud<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.600> one<00:04:10.720> for<00:04:11.050> being<00:04:11.230> my

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
a pretty proud of that one for being my

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.949 
a pretty proud of that one for being my
first<00:04:11.530> build<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.240> actually<00:04:13.420> very

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
first build so this is actually very

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:23.310 
first build so this is actually very
nice<00:04:14.620> inside

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.960 

okay<00:04:23.980> there's<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> bunch<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.460> fingerprints

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
okay there's a bunch of fingerprints

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.190 
okay there's a bunch of fingerprints

so what I'm going to do now is I'm going

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.209 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to<00:04:31.689> plug<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.020> power<00:04:32.169> cable<00:04:32.439> into<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:32.949> power

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:33.219 
to plug the power cable into the power

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.790 
to plug the power cable into the power
supply<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.169> I'm<00:04:35.169> just<00:04:35.289> going<00:04:35.379> to<00:04:35.469> turn<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
supply and I'm just going to turn the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.739 
supply and I'm just going to turn the
computer<00:04:36.069> on<00:04:36.219> for<00:04:36.639> just<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:36.939> couple<00:04:37.090> seconds<00:04:37.599> to

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:37.749 
computer on for just a couple seconds to

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.489 
computer on for just a couple seconds to
make<00:04:37.870> sure<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.319> it<00:04:38.710> actually<00:04:38.919> turns<00:04:39.310> on<00:04:40.499> I'm

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:41.499 
make sure that it actually turns on I'm

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:42.540 
make sure that it actually turns on I'm
just<00:04:41.620> going<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.860> go<00:04:41.949> ahead<00:04:42.039> and<00:04:42.249> hold<00:04:42.400> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
just going to go ahead and hold the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.279 
just going to go ahead and hold the
camera<00:04:42.789> so<00:04:44.099> move<00:04:45.099> it<00:04:45.189> a<00:04:45.310> little<00:04:45.400> bit<00:04:45.819> more

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
camera so move it a little bit more

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.189 
camera so move it a little bit more
towards<00:04:47.289> my<00:04:47.469> wall<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:48.789> power<00:04:49.270> cable<00:04:50.020> is

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
towards my wall the power cable is

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.800 
towards my wall the power cable is
plugged<00:04:50.499> into<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.949> power<00:04:51.039> supply<00:04:52.680> as<00:04:54.659> you<00:04:55.659> can

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
plugged into the power supply as you can

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.519 
plugged into the power supply as you can
see<00:04:57.990> on<00:04:58.990> switches<00:04:59.499> on<00:05:00.960> ok<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.199> think<00:05:02.289> we're

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:02.529 
see on switches on ok so I think we're

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.290 
see on switches on ok so I think we're
ready<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.860> turn<00:05:03.009> it<00:05:03.159> on<00:05:03.219> for<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> first<00:05:03.759> time<00:05:04.029> I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
ready to turn it on for the first time I
