00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
reasons well I spent 20 years of my 30

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.170 
reasons well I spent 20 years of my 30
in<00:01:50.350> Hawaii<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.009> little<00:01:51.310> tiny<00:01:51.670> village

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
in Hawaii in a little tiny village

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.080 
in Hawaii in a little tiny village
that's<00:01:52.479> about<00:01:52.719> same<00:01:53.020> size<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.520> difference<00:01:54.909> is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
that's about same size the difference is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.060 
that's about same size the difference is
that<00:01:55.119> they<00:01:55.360> spoke<00:01:55.600> Hawaiian<00:01:56.140> pidgin<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.770> they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
that they spoke Hawaiian pidgin and they

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.800 
that they spoke Hawaiian pidgin and they
speak<00:01:57.310> Spanish<00:01:57.430> here<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.329> I'm<00:01:58.420> having<00:01:58.600> to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
speak Spanish here so I'm having to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.840 
speak Spanish here so I'm having to
learn<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:58.990> new<00:01:59.380> language<00:01:59.770> but<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.579> very

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
learn a new language but it's very

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.910 
learn a new language but it's very
similar<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.479> very<00:02:01.750> similar<00:02:02.079> place

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
similar a very similar place

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.130 
similar a very similar place
well<00:02:03.070> I'm<00:02:03.159> thinking<00:02:03.310> Hawaii<00:02:03.789> has<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.299> be<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.659> lot

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
well I'm thinking Hawaii has to be a lot

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
well I'm thinking Hawaii has to be a lot
more<00:02:05.170> expensive<00:02:05.590> than<00:02:05.979> than<00:02:06.520> equitable

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.560 

probably<00:02:10.869> four<00:02:11.140> times<00:02:11.609> less<00:02:12.609> expensive<00:02:12.640> here

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
probably four times less expensive here

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.449 
probably four times less expensive here
at<00:02:14.470> least<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.880> ask<00:02:16.859> what<00:02:17.859> your<00:02:18.040> cost<00:02:18.310> of
