00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.230
 I hope 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.640
 Monday at the summer 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.650
 there is everyone it is link I hope 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.890
 that you are all going great for me 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.600
 that's super g fishing we end up 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.820
 today for a little gameplay on 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.740
 black ops 2 this is the first on my 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.590
 chain you are going to see who he is defying 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.950
 not too bad so I played there msm that's 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.000
 with fast charger and canes dropped 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.620
 on the almanhads lama standoff map and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.130
 he is accompanied by three members of the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.280
 Alix life thus made in Either ex and to whom 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.900
 I make big kisses so quickly 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 at the level of all that interests you I 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:02.740
 played with ghosts determination 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:05.619
 dexterity and robust and level 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.659
 tactical I had a deadly parry a 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.860
 small fragmentation that I find 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.590
 it's really my favorite class 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.290
 almost except that confession ends in 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.250
 I would just weight more now 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.110
 so before slashing the main theme 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.350
 from this comment and who would just like 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.570
 make a small focus I do not 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.640
 do not pretend to be one of 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.120
 best players in the world but I think 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.220
 always 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.840
 I still think I have a little one 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.610
 little potential a little to the caps this 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.080
 it's been quite a while now 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.540
 that legal sokolov especially in this 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 moment there I am already prestige puts by 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.320
 example so yeah I still play 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.610
 not too bad so I do not think either 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.900
 to be one of the worst players and so I 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.000
 think the advice I have to you 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.290
 bring in this video can you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.030
 help 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.070
 so just go back to the theme this 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.870
 video is how you improve to 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.820
 call of 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.010
 so I'm talking about black up two surfaces 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.409
 ramade mostly on black of the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.729
 but also about others what do you mean 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.670
 if his pity to call of us to more than 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.520
 almost all the others so already 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.039
 for me what is a good player a 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.590
 good player will have several qualities like 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.260
 shoot the moves 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 the brain and the style but the style 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.930
 I will go more than it will be in lease 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 so at the level of the shoot so what is it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.290
 that it's football quickly so it's 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.180
 your ability to go the most 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.640
 quickly on the night thanks to your 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.269
 viewfinder so it depends a lot on the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 sensitivity so precisely at the level of 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.510
 the low sensitivity how do you 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.920
 improve down by making parts 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.440
 against bots on small maps 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390
 like new daunou india yade in melee 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.610
 general you put 100 fanny points and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.030
 schott and you will see well the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.049
 result or 2.3 see if that I think 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.560
 that you will quickly feel a little 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.440
 difference 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.000
 you can also do this week 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.950
 drive except this time 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.200
 you put double life and there you will see 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.000
 also a small impact at the shoot 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.930
 Finally, it will be especially at that 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.340
 I think everyone at this 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 little mania his two so well 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 know the game or damman and we stop 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.769
 to draw what we stop shooting too much 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.910
 early what we know exactly the world 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.319
 of fake ovality but what you forget 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.549
 it is that according to the aco des foyens 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.269
 bring a little more serene to a few 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.920
 one that passes by and so that's so 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.540
 now at the level of displacements 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.250
 so the moves for you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.139
 improve low I advise you to 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.739
 a lot a lot looked at the radar me 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:29.560
 tell how you explain you do 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.389
 three seconds you look at your weapon 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.500
 finally and around you a second the 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.359
 radar like that always since that one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.880
 look like that and then you'll see well 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.230
 that it will bring you so will for you 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.810
 quickly lead to smart look at the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.010
 radar needed in general melee the same 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.720
 but you can do it for 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 the training of lepiotes you put 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.410
 to dar always active and you'll see well 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.519
 that you will laugh a lot about her 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.079
 radars what inevitably there will be all 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.239
 enemies 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.970
 so I think that at the end of tail like 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.620
 there of the same 1e I will ask a lot 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.019
 many watch him attention though 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.060
 not to look at it too much because there 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.299
 it would be defective for you and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.650
 necessarily low you will not lose you 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.180
 waste too much time watching him 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.920
 here 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.150
 so now at the brain level 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.930
 objects recalling that is what knows 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.729
 the brain down the brain it's your 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.169
 ability to how would I say business 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.519
 the deceased must say we must be 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.590
 fast it's your game intelligence 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.030
 that it's the purpose of these quickly 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.020
 to know where the enemies pass 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.150
 and so for the brave he 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.050
 have to know several things like 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.600
 knowledge of the map 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.710
 so it will also be very attached to the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.970
 level of travel but have a 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.280
 perfect knowledge of amap so 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.930
 all the paths used as well as 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.490
 when I speak knowledge of the map 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.139
 I would also say at the level of advice 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.060
 at spots here because 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.690
 the expo do you still go a lot 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.240
 a lot 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.039
 if you're doing low competition 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.330
 end the street pretty much the competition 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.220
 is that looking for species a 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.930
 grocer comes out of Spain coming out of 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.900
 able to bring back a maximum of flame or 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.669
 go the most cars the blues have 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.470
 for broken strategy this is quickly a 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.180
 forgetfulness never had the goal what it is 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.159
 also quite important so here is the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.380
 brain name will be it will depend on the spawn and 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.070
 end moves to all this but the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.330
 brave you will not be able to do 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.250
 workout so that boots and I 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.260
 warn you these are bugs bah 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.210
 boots that you are not really going 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.949
 really to train you will be 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.560
 only with gaming experience 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.810
 in gironde and of her too and that's 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.010
 for example if you are not in 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.380
 big series what I advise you 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.789
 if you see his friends coming in if the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.340
 halfway we arrived in front of you or a 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.320
 chat 5 here and g20 not to throw you 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.190
 in the heap either but and that's 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.599
 frankly to do the maximum 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.300
 safe disposal and then you will see 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.650
 well for example you hide you do 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.530
 a lil kick but here's a little help 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.210
 break what quiet then at the level 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.710
 of skiing so that as I say will be more 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.750
 in rhone n what is the skite 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.020
 low for me frankly the ski is the 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.419
 ability to play more with the exodus 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.099
 difficult to manage like some bridges 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.210
 but well not everything in this case the 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.009
 remington here we can say that it 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.030
 brings what it is I find but 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.030
 bridges like 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.410
 the bin the baitha valtat which 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.740
 besides, it's a lot of stories 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.750
 I think he is what he is and what 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.820
 others as a weapon at the web level at 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.470
 pump level his hunger not believed 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.020
 only with the lambda weapons you use 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.430
 so like the assault creative well 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.120
 sure if you're competing a 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.200
 minimum on lmp or so easy you 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.150
 start on countries where this guy is a 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.850
 factory and especially you are not going to 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.040
 have fun learn the ballista 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.370
 playing his shot a little too much said 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.000
 blow and then especially will not be concrete 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.770
 for your team what finally a last 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.510
 factor i would say it's luck well 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.360
 will not be safe if it soon 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.950
 you have to go there all four lives 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.050
 four abilities that I say just before 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.250
 well it will help you a lot but the 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.940
 chance is a factor that can 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.190
 how is it really 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.790
 last tip is what really the 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.370
 last is the toy for you do not 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.800
 never looking to resemble or 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.740
 your partners that is to say you 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.450
 know a little day his wake not 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.730
 the importunent 6 bat do not look 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.880
 go to the sea ​​as well as him since 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:21.460
 you're going to do more shit than anything else 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.920
 thing anyway it's my expression and 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.930
 in idem at the level of weapons you manage 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.380
 super good with the champion champion had 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.660
 did not try to take another cua 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.010
 finally I 'm always going to please nora I 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.200
 no fodder 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.320
 we start to play less then 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.790
 here is thrown my last advice go worse 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.290
 and then I hope a chain 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.950
 Community will not accept skiable and 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.950
 ciao
