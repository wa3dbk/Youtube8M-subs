is<00:02:19.629> they're<00:02:19.840> expensive<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:21.099> we<00:02:21.189> have<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.549> use

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
is they're expensive and we have to use

is they're expensive and we have to use
them<00:02:21.939> too<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.389> the<00:02:22.510> patients<00:02:22.930> who<00:02:22.959> need<00:02:23.200> them
