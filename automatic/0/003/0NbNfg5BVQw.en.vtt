dragon into our habitat and I think this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.780 
dragon into our habitat and I think this
is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> only<00:01:30.030> habitat<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:31.460> let<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.549> on

is the only habitat I have let me go on
in<00:01:32.970> here

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
in here

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
in here
alright<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> food<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.610> still<00:01:35.880> making<00:01:36.329> Wow

alright the food is still making Wow

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
alright the food is still making Wow
alright<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:37.799> gonna<00:01:37.920> take<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> while

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
alright so that's gonna take a while

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.230 
alright so that's gonna take a while
then<00:01:38.670> coming<00:01:39.540> back<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
then coming back here here it is so I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
guess what makes him naughty is that he

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.289 
guess what makes him naughty is that he
goes<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> building<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.850> start

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.070 
and it will evolve at level seven and
there<00:02:17.409> it<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.950> think<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:19.000> gone<00:02:19.360> skinnier

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
there it is I think it's gone skinnier

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.259 
there it is I think it's gone skinnier
in<00:02:20.349> my<00:02:20.680> opinion<00:02:21.159> let's<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:21.879> back<00:02:22.060> out<00:02:22.209> there

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
in my opinion let's get back out there

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.600 
in my opinion let's get back out there
and<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:22.989> back<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.379> here<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:27.250> terms<00:02:27.489> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and go back in here in terms of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.640 
and go back in here in terms of
animation<00:02:27.909> I'm<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.569> sure<00:02:28.780> what's<00:02:28.989> happening

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
animation I'm not sure what's happening

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.210 
animation I'm not sure what's happening
oh<00:02:29.680> okay<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.870> sort<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> ant<00:02:32.260> kind<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.709> walked<00:02:32.950> by

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
oh okay so sort of ant kind of walked by

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.699 
oh okay so sort of ant kind of walked by
and<00:02:33.430> then<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.849> Tunney<00:02:34.180> uses<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:35.049> magnifying

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
and then it Tunney uses the magnifying

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.380 
and then it Tunney uses the magnifying
glass<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:36.069> magnify<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.329> sun's<00:02:38.079> ray<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.390> then
