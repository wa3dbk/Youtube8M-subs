through here make the three ball in that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.609 
through here make the three ball in that
corner<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.490> four<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.330> corner<00:00:21.689> now

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
corner and the four in this corner now

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.609 
corner and the four in this corner now
the<00:00:22.680> way<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> set<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.930> put<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.380> ball

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the way you set this up you put one ball

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.279 
the way you set this up you put one ball
here<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.609> put<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
here and you put it right here where the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.710 
here and you put it right here where the
edge<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.920> aligned<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.910> pocket<00:00:30.330> point

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
edge is aligned with this pocket point

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.040

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.510 
the three right where my stick is and if
you<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.950> cue<00:01:17.220> ball<00:01:17.400> will

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
all right so what happened on that first

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.260 
all right so what happened on that first
attempt<00:01:33.770> was<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.310> hit<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.550> three<00:01:34.790> ball<00:01:34.970> a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
attempt was I hit the three ball a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.390 
attempt was I hit the three ball a
little<00:01:35.450> too<00:01:35.600> full<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.740> cue<00:01:36.979> ball<00:01:37.130> came

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
little too full the cue ball came

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.399 
little too full the cue ball came
through<00:01:37.790> actually<00:01:38.330> hit<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.570> three<00:01:38.810> ball<00:01:39.020> too

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
through actually hit the three ball too

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.430 
through actually hit the three ball too
full<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.750> which<00:01:41.750> caused<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.229> four

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
full like that which caused the four

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.050 
full like that which caused the four
ball<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:42.890> not<00:01:43.070> enough<00:01:43.280> energy<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.970> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
ball to have not enough energy and it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.550 
ball to have not enough energy and it
just<00:01:44.240> barely<00:01:44.420> rolled<00:01:44.810> towards<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.170> pocket

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
just barely rolled towards the pocket

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.440 
just barely rolled towards the pocket
what<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.220> really<00:01:46.550> want<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.000> want<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.270> cue

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
what I really want is I want the cue

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.390 
what I really want is I want the cue
ball<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.690> hit<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.900> three<00:01:48.080> ball<00:01:48.229> here<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.280> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
ball to hit the three ball here so the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.010 
ball to hit the three ball here so the
four<00:01:49.610> ball<00:01:49.729> gets<00:01:49.910> more<00:01:50.090> energy<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.720> moves

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
four ball gets more energy and moves

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.680 
four ball gets more energy and moves
towards<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.350> pocket<00:01:51.680> quicker<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.479> order

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
towards the pocket quicker so in order

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.430 
towards the pocket quicker so in order
to<00:01:53.810> adjust<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:55.450> instead<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.570> aiming<00:01:56.690> over<00:01:56.960> here

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
to adjust is instead of aiming over here

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.249 
to adjust is instead of aiming over here
I'm<00:01:57.890> gonna<00:01:58.130> adjust<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.759> aim<00:01:58.940> out<00:01:59.600> here<00:02:00.050> which

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
I'm gonna adjust and aim out here which

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.560 
I'm gonna adjust and aim out here which
would<00:02:00.380> cause<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.740> cue<00:02:00.920> ball<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.220> be<00:02:01.399> more<00:02:02.270> left

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
would cause the cue ball to be more left

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.420 
would cause the cue ball to be more left
and<00:02:02.780> it'll<00:02:03.229> hit<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> three<00:02:03.740> ball<00:02:03.950> at<00:02:04.220> more<00:02:04.399> of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and it'll hit the three ball at more of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.070 
and it'll hit the three ball at more of
an<00:02:04.580> angle<00:02:04.700> which<00:02:05.420> would<00:02:05.570> give<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.720> four<00:02:05.930> ball

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
an angle which would give the four ball

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:16.840 
an angle which would give the four ball
more<00:02:06.229> energy<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.710> get<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.009> pocket<00:02:15.850> coming

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
more energy to get to the pocket coming

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.520 
more energy to get to the pocket coming
