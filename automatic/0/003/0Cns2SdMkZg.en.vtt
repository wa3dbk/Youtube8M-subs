00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
probably some meaning to that but that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.780 
probably some meaning to that but that
just<00:01:03.329> sounds<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.719> gibberish<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
just sounds like gibberish to me and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.450 
just sounds like gibberish to me and
what<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> does<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.830> when<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.979> shoot<00:01:08.189> zombies

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.310 
what it does is when you shoot zombies
it's<00:01:08.820> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> focused<00:01:09.720> thundergun

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's kind of like a focused thundergun

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.480 
it's kind of like a focused thundergun
type<00:01:10.590> thing<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.070> doesn't<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.350> the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
type thing it doesn't have the the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.859 
type thing it doesn't have the the
spread<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.670> thunder<00:01:14.939> gun<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
spread of a thunder gun but it's it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
spread of a thunder gun but it's it
still<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> spread<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
still got that little bit of spread to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
still got that little bit of spread to
it<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.630> got<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> lot<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.009> penetration

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it and it's got a lot more penetration

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
it and it's got a lot more penetration
than<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:20.610> they've<00:01:21.030> rail<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.689> something<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
than say they've rail or something and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
than say they've rail or something and
it<00:01:22.890> seems<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> shrink<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> zombies<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.869> I

it seems to shrink the zombies now I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.300 
it seems to shrink the zombies now I
don't<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.530> happens<00:01:25.799> after<00:01:26.159> they've

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
don't know what happens after they've

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.899 
don't know what happens after they've
gotten<00:01:26.640> shrunk<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:28.009> that's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.430> achievement

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
gotten shrunk but that's the achievement

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.850 
gotten shrunk but that's the achievement
for<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.540> shrinking<00:01:31.229> every<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
for that is shrinking every kind of
zombie<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.880> leads<00:01:33.180> me<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:33.600> next<00:01:33.750> piece

and what the Napalm zombie does is when
you<00:01:45.329> shoot<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:45.960> kill<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.590> explodes<00:01:47.070> into

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you shoot it or kill it it explodes into

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.350 
you shoot it or kill it it explodes into
napalm<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:50.369> stuff<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.820> damage<00:01:51.090> players

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
napalm and that stuff can damage players

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560 
napalm and that stuff can damage players
and<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.560> Shrieker<00:01:52.920> zombie<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.570> blinds

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and the Shrieker zombie it blinds

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.749 
and the Shrieker zombie it blinds
players<00:01:54.840> kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> i'm<00:01:55.799> assuming<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
players kind of i'm assuming like a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.760 
players kind of i'm assuming like a
flashbang<00:01:57.299> type<00:01:57.540> effect<00:01:57.710> now<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
flashbang type effect now the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.230 
flashbang type effect now the
achievement<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.759> with<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> napalm

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
achievement to do with the napalm

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.389 
achievement to do with the napalm
zombies<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.899> killin<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> palm<00:02:01.799> zombie<00:02:02.159> without

zombies is killin a palm zombie without

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.090 
zombies is killin a palm zombie without
damaging<00:02:02.880> additive<00:02:03.180> players<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
damaging additive players and the one to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.590 
damaging additive players and the one to
do<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> Shrieker<00:02:05.640> zombie<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.180> killa

do with the Shrieker zombie is killa

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.059 
do with the Shrieker zombie is killa
Shrieker<00:02:06.960> zombie<00:02:07.259> while<00:02:07.469> you're<00:02:07.619> blinded<00:02:07.950> by

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
Shrieker zombie while you're blinded by

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.420 
Shrieker zombie while you're blinded by
it<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.879> yeah<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.800> flash

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
it so yeah probably just kind of flash

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.240 
it so yeah probably just kind of flash
bangs<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
bangs you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.470 
bangs you
which<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.760> imagine<00:02:12.910> would<00:02:13.150> be<00:02:13.270> really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
which I can imagine would be really

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.710 
which I can imagine would be really
freaking<00:02:14.050> annoying<00:02:14.490> but<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:16.240> does<00:02:16.450> what<00:02:16.630> it

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
freaking annoying but it does what it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020 
freaking annoying but it does what it
does<00:02:16.750> i<00:02:17.020> guess<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:18.520> one<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> do<00:02:18.850> with<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
does i guess and the one to do with the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.100 
does i guess and the one to do with the
easter<00:02:19.330> egg<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:21.510> think<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.780> achievements

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
easter egg is I think the achievements

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.710 
easter egg is I think the achievements
called<00:02:23.350> time<00:02:23.590> travel<00:02:24.070> will<00:02:24.190> tail<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
called time travel will tail and the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.110 
called time travel will tail and the
description<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.500> get<00:02:27.250> or<00:02:27.490> acquire<00:02:27.910> or

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
description is get or acquire or

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.000 
description is get or acquire or
something<00:02:28.480> along<00:02:28.570> those<00:02:28.840> lines<00:02:28.930> get<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
something along those lines get the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.750 
something along those lines get the
focusing<00:02:30.520> stone<00:02:30.820> now<00:02:31.920> what<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.040> implies<00:02:33.220> is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
focusing stone now what this implies is

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.920 
focusing stone now what this implies is
I<00:02:33.790> don't<00:02:34.000> think<00:02:34.420> they<00:02:34.540> would<00:02:34.660> make<00:02:34.840> an

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
I don't think they would make an

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.360 
I don't think they would make an
achievement<00:02:35.260> midway<00:02:35.770> through<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.040> Easter

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
achievement midway through the Easter

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.150 
achievement midway through the Easter
eggs<00:02:36.490> so<00:02:36.900> assuming<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.800> final

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
eggs so assuming that this is the final

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.710 
eggs so assuming that this is the final
thing<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.550> easter<00:02:39.820> egg<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.090> appears<00:02:40.600> you

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
thing of the easter egg it appears you

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.930 
thing of the easter egg it appears you
actually<00:02:41.020> get<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.470> focusing<00:02:42.160> stone<00:02:42.400> if<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
actually get the focusing stone if you

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.280 
actually get the focusing stone if you
complete<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.360> easter<00:02:43.600> egg<00:02:43.690> which<00:02:43.870> means<00:02:44.140> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
complete the easter egg which means you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
complete the easter egg which means you
can<00:02:44.470> probably<00:02:44.770> use<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.550> game<00:02:45.700> somehow

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
can probably use it in the game somehow

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.170 
can probably use it in the game somehow
now<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:46.989> achievement<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.830> just<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:48.880> orb

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
now the achievement is just this orb

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.180 
now the achievement is just this orb
with<00:02:49.900> like<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.290> moon<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.739> background<00:02:50.770> i

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
with like the moon in the background i

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800 
with like the moon in the background i
think<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.520> moon<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:52.330> what<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.600> looks

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
think it's the moon that's what it looks

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.990 
think it's the moon that's what it looks
like<00:02:52.900> at<00:02:53.080> least<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.830> i<00:02:54.310> know<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.580> map<00:02:54.790> has

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
like at least so and i know this map has

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.229 
like at least so and i know this map has
a<00:02:55.060> eclipse<00:02:55.870> type<00:02:56.110> cycle<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.580> probably<00:02:57.820> has

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
a eclipse type cycle so it probably has

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.120 
a eclipse type cycle so it probably has
something<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.540> do<00:02:58.660> with<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.530> at<00:02:59.980> this

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
something to do with that but at this

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.420 
something to do with that but at this
point<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.489> can't<00:03:00.790> even<00:03:00.880> hazard<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.330> guess<00:03:01.360> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
point I can't even hazard a guess and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.130 
point I can't even hazard a guess and
the<00:03:03.430> last<00:03:03.580> achievement<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.239> nothing<00:03:04.959> too

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the last achievement is nothing too

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.229 
the last achievement is nothing too
spectacular<00:03:05.410> we're<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.130> know<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> monkeys

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
spectacular we're to know the monkeys

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.330 
spectacular we're to know the monkeys
that<00:03:07.270> run<00:03:07.540> around<00:03:07.660> dropping<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.380> drops<00:03:08.620> it's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
that run around dropping the drops it's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.470 
that run around dropping the drops it's
just<00:03:09.550> pick<00:03:09.700> up<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> drops<00:03:10.270> from<00:03:10.390> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
just pick up one of the drops from the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.690 
just pick up one of the drops from the
monkeys<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.020> they<00:03:11.860> just<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.400> don't<00:03:12.550> know

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
monkeys and they just if you don't know

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.430 
monkeys and they just if you don't know
you<00:03:13.000> can<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.270> look<00:03:13.390> at<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.690> first<00:03:13.959> trail<00:03:14.200> I

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
you can go look at the first trail I

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.600 
you can go look at the first trail I
think<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:14.770> actually<00:03:14.980> might<00:03:15.250> be<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.459> both

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
think it's actually might be in both

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.460 
think it's actually might be in both
trailers<00:03:15.820> but<00:03:16.090> there's<00:03:16.720> these<00:03:16.900> monkeys<00:03:17.320> that

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
trailers but there's these monkeys that

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.050 
trailers but there's these monkeys that
run<00:03:17.620> around<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.010> they<00:03:18.100> got<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.459> drops<00:03:18.880> on

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
run around and they got the drops on

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.220 
run around and they got the drops on
their<00:03:19.180> head<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:19.750> cycles<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.200> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
their head and it just cycles to a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.509 
their head and it just cycles to a
different<00:03:20.470> job<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.830> when<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:20.980> kill<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.160> drops

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
different job and when you kill it drops

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.520 
different job and when you kill it drops
that<00:03:21.670> drop<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.600> what<00:03:22.750> i<00:03:22.780> mean<00:03:22.930> by<00:03:23.049> drops<00:03:23.290> are

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
that drop like what i mean by drops are
