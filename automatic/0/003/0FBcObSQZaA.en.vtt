want to talk to you guys about a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.639 
want to talk to you guys about a
question<00:00:05.490> I've<00:00:05.759> been<00:00:05.940> asked<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.230> when

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
question I've been asked and it was when

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.830 
question I've been asked and it was when
to<00:00:07.919> quit<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.280> sport<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.360> think<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
to quit a sport and I think this is a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.509 
to quit a sport and I think this is a
very<00:00:10.110> interesting<00:00:10.500> question<00:00:10.920> because<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.490> know

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
very interesting question because I know

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.490 
very interesting question because I know
I<00:00:11.670> have<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> lot<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.090> younger<00:00:12.480> viewers<00:00:12.690> who<00:00:13.410> are

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
I have a lot of younger viewers who are

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.189 
I have a lot of younger viewers who are
probably<00:00:13.920> into<00:00:14.340> school<00:00:14.639> sports<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:16.049> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
probably into school sports and this is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.830 
probably into school sports and this is
something<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.160> feel<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
something that I just feel like is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.880 
something that I just feel like is
misrepresented<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:18.960> far<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.289> how<00:00:19.439> people<00:00:19.470> have

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
misrepresented as far as how people have

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.189 
misrepresented as far as how people have
an<00:00:20.010> attitude<00:00:20.369> towards<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.119> people<00:00:21.840> act<00:00:22.050> like

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
an attitude towards it people act like

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.140 
an attitude towards it people act like
quitting<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.010> something<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.609> inherently

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
quitting is something that's inherently

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150 
quitting is something that's inherently
bad<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.019> reason<00:00:25.320> why<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.010> can

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
bad the reason why I think that this can

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.730 
bad the reason why I think that this can
be<00:00:26.310> such<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> big<00:00:26.880> problem<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.140> odds<00:00:28.470> are

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
be such a big problem is that odds are

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
be such a big problem is that odds are
you<00:00:28.920> won't<00:00:29.189> find<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.730> you're<00:00:29.880> best<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.330> until

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you won't find what you're best at until

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
you won't find what you're best at until
you<00:00:30.840> try<00:00:31.109> different<00:00:31.349> things<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
you try different things and this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
you try different things and this
pertains<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> anything<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.870> life<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
pertains to anything in life but if you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920 
pertains to anything in life but if you
just<00:00:35.100> stick<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.820> sport<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.660> because

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
just stick with one sport just because

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270 
just stick with one sport just because
you<00:00:37.079> happen<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you happen to be in that from the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.889 
you happen to be in that from the
beginning<00:00:38.399> you're<00:00:39.149> essentially<00:00:39.570> becoming

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
beginning you're essentially becoming

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.780 
beginning you're essentially becoming
the<00:00:40.079> victim<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> your<00:00:40.590> circumstances<00:00:40.790> rather

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the victim of your circumstances rather

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.610 
the victim of your circumstances rather
than<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.420> finding<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.200> natural

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
than actually finding where your natural

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.709 
than actually finding where your natural
talent<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> however<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> balance

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
talent is however there is a balance

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.299 
talent is however there is a balance
because<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> don't<00:00:46.350> want<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> quit<00:00:46.800> too<00:00:46.950> early

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because you don't want to quit too early

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
because you don't want to quit too early
and<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.579> often<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> temptation<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and that's often the temptation when it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
and that's often the temptation when it
comes<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> sports<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.520> I'll<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.850> give<00:00:51.000> myself

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
comes to sports so I'll just give myself

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
comes to sports so I'll just give myself
as<00:00:51.629> an<00:00:51.750> example<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.500> started<00:00:53.190> playing

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
as an example I started playing

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
as an example I started playing
basketball<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.570> third<00:00:54.840> grade<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
basketball when I was in third grade and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
basketball when I was in third grade and
I<00:00:56.010> wanted<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> quit<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.789> away<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:58.079> dad

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I wanted to quit right away and my dad

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.400 
I wanted to quit right away and my dad
basically<00:00:58.920> forced<00:00:59.520> me<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> quit<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
basically forced me not to quit and you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
basically forced me not to quit and you
know<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.770> may<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.010> seen<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> smart

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
know this may be seen as not a smart

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
know this may be seen as not a smart
decision<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.899> force<00:01:04.199> your<00:01:04.379> kid<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> play<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
decision to force your kid to play a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
decision to force your kid to play a
sport<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> did<00:01:06.180> pay<00:01:06.360> off<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> long<00:01:06.960> run

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
sport but it did pay off in the long run

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.840 
sport but it did pay off in the long run
because<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.770> wanted<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> quit<00:01:08.400> probably

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
because I just wanted to quit probably

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.039 
because I just wanted to quit probably
for<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> wrong<00:01:09.299> reasons

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
for the wrong reasons

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.450 
for the wrong reasons
so<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> ended<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.500> playing<00:01:10.650> basketball<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so I ended up playing basketball all the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980 
so I ended up playing basketball all the
way<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> high<00:01:11.970> school<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.900> the

way up to high school and in the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
way up to high school and in the
meantime<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.380> tried<00:01:13.740> football<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.580> track<00:01:14.760> as

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
meantime I tried football and track as

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
meantime I tried football and track as
well<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.960> those<00:01:16.200> track<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.920> best

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189

I had to decide whether I was going to
just<00:01:20.759> stop<00:01:21.030> competing<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.659> track<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> stop

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
actually my brother who convinced me to
keep<00:01:27.869> competing<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> track<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.890> college<00:01:29.340> he

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
keep competing and track in college he

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
keep competing and track in college he
was<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> track<00:01:30.210> athlete<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.810> well<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.259> he<00:01:31.409> was

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
was a track athlete as well in he was

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
was a track athlete as well in he was
two<00:01:31.680> years<00:01:31.890> older<00:01:32.220> than<00:01:32.250> me<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.700> he<00:01:33.240> really

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
two years older than me so he really

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
two years older than me so he really
strongly<00:01:33.869> advised<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> had<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
strongly advised me to do this and had I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
strongly advised me to do this and had I
quit<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:37.020> probably<00:01:37.229> would<00:01:37.470> have

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
quit I really probably would have

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.530 
quit I really probably would have
stopped<00:01:37.799> working<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.280> altogether<00:01:38.909> maybe

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
stopped working out altogether maybe

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210 
stopped working out altogether maybe
just<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> side<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
just a little bit on the side but it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.319 
just a little bit on the side but it
definitely<00:01:41.670> would<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.820> negatively

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
definitely would have negatively

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.569 
definitely would have negatively
affected<00:01:42.960> my<00:01:43.079> life<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> couple<00:01:44.280> years

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
affected my life but then a couple years

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819 
affected my life but then a couple years
into<00:01:44.820> college<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.450> quit<00:01:45.750> track<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
into college I quit track and this

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.440 
into college I quit track and this
turned<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> great<00:01:47.820> decision<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
turned out to be a great decision and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.929 
turned out to be a great decision and
the<00:01:48.869> reason<00:01:49.200> being<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.250> conflicting

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the reason being was it was conflicting

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.969 
the reason being was it was conflicting
with<00:01:51.210> powerlifting<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.320> obviously<00:01:52.560> I'm

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
with powerlifting because obviously I'm

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.380 
with powerlifting because obviously I'm
not<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.430> able<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> maximally

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
not going to be able to maximally

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
not going to be able to maximally
perform<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:54.990> my<00:01:55.110> best<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.740> either<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.490> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
perform at my best in either one of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
perform at my best in either one of
those<00:01:56.790> sports<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.570> actually<00:01:57.899> ended<00:01:58.140> up

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
those sports but actually ended up

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.660 
those sports but actually ended up
happening<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.829> literally<00:01:59.130> almost<00:01:59.520> got

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
happening is I literally almost got

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
happening is I literally almost got
kicked<00:01:59.939> off<00:02:00.090> my<00:02:00.360> track<00:02:00.630> team<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> was

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
kicked off my track team because I was

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
kicked off my track team because I was
doing<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.680> own<00:02:01.710> programming<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.549> far<00:02:02.729> as

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
doing my own programming as far as

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.130 
doing my own programming as far as
lifting<00:02:03.180> weights<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:04.020> probably

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
lifting weights so now you're probably

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
lifting weights so now you're probably
wondering<00:02:04.799> how<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.579> sure<00:02:05.610> if

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
wondering how do you know for sure if

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.100 
wondering how do you know for sure if
you<00:02:05.969> should<00:02:06.149> quit<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.869> should<00:02:07.079> just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you should quit or if you should just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
you should quit or if you should just
keep<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.520> opinion<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.060> answer

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
keep going and in my opinion that answer

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
keep going and in my opinion that answer
is<00:02:09.509> very<00:02:09.539> simple<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.619> moment<00:02:11.069> when<00:02:11.280> you're

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
is very simple the moment when you're

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.320 
is very simple the moment when you're
continuing<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.180> sport<00:02:12.540> impedes

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
continuing a sport impedes

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.610 
continuing a sport impedes
other<00:02:13.480> opportunities<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.470> would

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
other opportunities that you would

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.830 
other opportunities that you would
rather<00:02:14.770> pursue<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.210> when<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> quit<00:02:16.810> that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
rather pursue that is when you quit that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.900 
rather pursue that is when you quit that
sport<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.650> told<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.190> going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.520> simple

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
sport I told you is going to be a simple

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.550 
sport I told you is going to be a simple
concept<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.840> might<00:02:19.990> just<00:02:20.020> think<00:02:20.350> well

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
concept and you might just think well

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.620 
concept and you might just think well
that's<00:02:20.650> common<00:02:21.160> sense<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:22.060> when<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.330> comes<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that's common sense but when it comes to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.390 
that's common sense but when it comes to
actually<00:02:23.050> applying<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.070> lot<00:02:24.280> of

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
actually applying it I see a lot of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.340 
actually applying it I see a lot of
people<00:02:24.640> make<00:02:24.820> mistakes<00:02:25.270> because<00:02:25.870> what<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> lot

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
people make mistakes because what a lot

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.930 
people make mistakes because what a lot
of<00:02:26.380> people<00:02:26.530> do<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.010> they<00:02:27.040> quit<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> sport<00:02:27.820> just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
of people do is they quit a sport just

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.250 
of people do is they quit a sport just
because<00:02:28.270> they're<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.390> having<00:02:28.660> fun<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:29.200> a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
because they're not having fun for a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.410 
because they're not having fun for a
short<00:02:29.530> period<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.920> time<00:02:29.980> perhaps<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:31.210> had<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
short period of time perhaps they had a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.810 
short period of time perhaps they had a
bad<00:02:31.660> year<00:02:32.050> or<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> bad<00:02:32.470> month<00:02:32.830> or<00:02:33.340> maybe<00:02:33.490> even

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
bad year or a bad month or maybe even

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.730 
bad year or a bad month or maybe even
just<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.090> bad<00:02:34.240> competition<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.350> that's<00:02:35.500> not<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
just a bad competition and that's not a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.470 
just a bad competition and that's not a
good<00:02:35.950> reason<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.250> quit<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.820> should<00:02:37.030> quit<00:02:37.300> when

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
good reason to quit you should quit when

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.670 
good reason to quit you should quit when
you're<00:02:37.570> literally<00:02:37.990> preventing<00:02:38.380> yourself

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
you're literally preventing yourself

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.980 
you're literally preventing yourself
from<00:02:39.070> doing<00:02:39.730> something<00:02:40.150> greater

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
from doing something greater

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.230 
from doing something greater
just<00:02:41.380> by<00:02:41.500> boxing<00:02:42.040> yourself<00:02:42.370> into<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> sport

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
just by boxing yourself into a sport

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.850 
just by boxing yourself into a sport
that<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.480> already<00:02:43.720> are<00:02:44.020> competing<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.710> I'll

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
that you already are competing it I'll

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.320 
that you already are competing it I'll
give<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.160> guys<00:02:45.310> an<00:02:45.520> example<00:02:45.610> let's<00:02:46.150> say

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
give you guys an example let's say

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.270 
give you guys an example let's say
you're<00:02:46.510> five<00:02:46.750> foot<00:02:47.020> five<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.950> really

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
you're five foot five and you really

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.920 
you're five foot five and you really
enjoy<00:02:48.400> football<00:02:49.150> but<00:02:49.390> you're<00:02:49.510> told<00:02:49.750> you're

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
enjoy football but you're told you're

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.080 
enjoy football but you're told you're
too<00:02:50.170> small<00:02:50.470> let's<00:02:50.740> say<00:02:50.830> you're<00:02:50.980> 114<00:02:51.790> pounds

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
too small let's say you're 114 pounds

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.300

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
if you gave another sport a shot then

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.650

you're better at it you probably enjoyed
even<00:03:51.489> more<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.239> it's<00:03:52.390> imperative<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:52.930> my

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
have fun but it also can lower your

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.420 
have fun but it also can lower your
self-esteem<00:04:22.900> because<00:04:23.470> now<00:04:23.770> you're<00:04:23.979> used<00:04:24.310> to

being a bench player you think of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.980 
being a bench player you think of
yourself<00:04:26.229> as<00:04:26.380> less<00:04:26.680> than

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
