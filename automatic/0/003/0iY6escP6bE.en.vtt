outer<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.700> think<00:01:56.420> they<00:01:56.539> call<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.780> our<00:01:58.509> nut

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
outer I think they call it our nut

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.630 
outer I think they call it our nut
something<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.979> they<00:02:01.310> call<00:02:01.520> it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
something like that they call it

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.660 
something like that they call it
something<00:02:01.820> on<00:02:02.740> tighten<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:03.830> down<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.220> 27

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
something on tighten that down to 27

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.130 
something on tighten that down to 27
foot<00:02:04.909> pounds<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.939> then<00:02:08.390> back<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.750> off<00:02:08.840> one

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
foot pounds and then back it off one

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.820 
foot pounds and then back it off one
turn<00:02:09.489> tighten<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.550> back<00:02:10.580> up<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:12.739> this

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
turn tighten it back up so for this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.280 
turn tighten it back up so for this
demonstration<00:02:13.160> I'm<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:13.850> going<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.000> simply

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
demonstration I'm just going to simply

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.250 
demonstration I'm just going to simply
get<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> hand<00:02:15.620> tight<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.780> next<00:02:17.989> thing<00:02:18.110> would

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
get it hand tight the next thing would

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.250 
get it hand tight the next thing would
go<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.670> would<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.819> your<00:02:20.030> upper<00:02:20.569> clamp<00:02:23.260> which

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
go on would be your upper clamp which

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.920 
go on would be your upper clamp which
again<00:02:24.560> I'm<00:02:24.709> using<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:25.040> tag<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:29.540> may<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.750> to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
again I'm using a tag you may have to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.289 
again I'm using a tag you may have to
have<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:30.380> finesse<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.290> go<00:02:34.299> and

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
have a little finesse there we go and

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.820 
have a little finesse there we go and
you've<00:02:35.840> got<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.989> washer<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:38.140> then<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:39.410> upper

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
you've got a washer and then your upper

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.620 
you've got a washer and then your upper
nut<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:41.620> you're<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.709> tightened<00:02:43.130> down<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
nut and you're not tightened down the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.500 
nut and you're not tightened down the
upper<00:02:44.840> nuttin<00:02:45.140> or<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.349> washer<00:02:45.680> yet<00:02:46.359> just<00:02:47.359> want

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
upper nuttin or the washer yet just want

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.660 
upper nuttin or the washer yet just want
to<00:02:47.570> have<00:02:47.690> those<00:02:47.870> hand<00:02:48.200> tight<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.769> then<00:02:49.579> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
to have those hand tight and then you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.039 
to have those hand tight and then you
want<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.880> put<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.090> fork<00:02:50.329> tubes<00:02:50.570> in<00:02:50.810> because

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
want to put your fork tubes in because

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.710 
want to put your fork tubes in because
if<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.350> tighten<00:02:51.560> these<00:02:51.769> up<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:53.000> these<00:02:53.450> are
