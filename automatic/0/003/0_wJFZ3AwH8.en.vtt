00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
of rust coming through the paint looks

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.150 
of rust coming through the paint looks
like<00:00:39.399> most<00:00:39.579> of<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.790> trim<00:00:40.059> is<00:00:40.300> uh<00:00:40.770> yes<00:00:41.770> this

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
like most of the trim is uh yes this

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.450 
like most of the trim is uh yes this
either<00:00:42.640> missing<00:00:43.149> or<00:00:43.300> missing<00:00:44.020> yeah<00:00:44.460> the

problem with something like this is sure

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.959 
problem with something like this is sure
it's<00:00:47.260> all<00:00:47.379> here<00:00:47.800> but<00:00:48.280> nearly<00:00:48.520> everything<00:00:48.789> on

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
if this card was free you can be upside

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.849 
if this card was free you can be upside
down<00:00:57.820> in<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.030> hurry<00:00:58.180> if<00:00:58.719> you<00:00:58.750> look<00:00:58.989> as<00:00:59.170> we<00:00:59.559> look

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
down in a hurry if you look as we look

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.650 
down in a hurry if you look as we look
at<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.070> interior<00:01:00.340> basically<00:01:01.329> it<00:01:01.390> looks<00:01:01.480> like

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
at the interior basically it looks like

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.680 
at the interior basically it looks like
a<00:01:01.690> 200<00:01:02.109> pound<00:01:02.230> rat<00:01:02.500> has<00:01:02.649> lived<00:01:02.829> in<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.100> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a 200 pound rat has lived in it and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.940 
a 200 pound rat has lived in it and
there's<00:01:04.690> little<00:01:04.839> bonuses<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.470> see<00:01:05.619> on<00:01:05.710> top<00:01:05.860> of

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
there's little bonuses you see on top of

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.530 
there's little bonuses you see on top of
the<00:01:06.010> antenna<00:01:06.159> over<00:01:06.520> there<00:01:06.790> there's<00:01:07.150> about<00:01:07.299> two

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
the antenna over there there's about two

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.270 
the antenna over there there's about two
million<00:01:07.900> spiders<00:01:08.560> who<00:01:08.770> are<00:01:08.860> looking<00:01:09.070> for<00:01:09.250> a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
million spiders who are looking for a

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.390 
million spiders who are looking for a
new<00:01:09.430> home<00:01:10.470> what's<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.590> upside<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:12.070> this<00:01:12.100> car

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
new home what's the upside on this car

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.890 
new home what's the upside on this car
here<00:01:12.580> well<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.150> barn<00:01:13.360> fine<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.780> barn

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
here well it is a barn fine and barn

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.320 
here well it is a barn fine and barn
finds<00:01:14.140> our<00:01:14.470> big<00:01:14.680> deal<00:01:14.830> right<00:01:15.070> now<00:01:15.150> I'd<00:01:16.150> say

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
finds our big deal right now I'd say

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.899 
finds our big deal right now I'd say
it's<00:01:16.510> probably<00:01:16.780> worth<00:01:17.080> about<00:01:17.470> $2,000<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.549> know

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
it's probably worth about $2,000 I know

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
it's probably worth about $2,000 I know
you're<00:01:19.119> gonna<00:01:19.240> disagree<00:01:19.720> with<00:01:19.840> me<00:01:19.930> there

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you're gonna disagree with me there

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.010 
you're gonna disagree with me there
seems<00:01:21.310> optimistic<00:01:21.490> if<00:01:22.119> it<00:01:22.420> runs<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.810> drives

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
seems optimistic if it runs and drives

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.749 
seems optimistic if it runs and drives
and<00:01:23.170> stops<00:01:23.439> I<00:01:23.770> think<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.460> could<00:01:24.549> probably

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
and stops I think it could probably

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.070 
and stops I think it could probably
bring<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.180> kind<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.450> money<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.930> reason

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
bring that kind of money and the reason

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.690 
bring that kind of money and the reason
for<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:26.650> you<00:01:26.830> just<00:01:26.950> don't<00:01:27.189> see<00:01:27.580> them

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
for that is you just don't see them

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.410 
for that is you just don't see them
anymore

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
anymore

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.469 
anymore
yeah<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.100> also<00:01:30.189> falls<00:01:30.579> into<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.970> rear<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
yeah but it also falls into the rear and

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.330 
yeah but it also falls into the rear and
should<00:01:31.689> be<00:01:31.840> category<00:01:32.290> 2<00:01:32.500> which<00:01:32.799> that's<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.220> good

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
should be category 2 which that's a good

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.100 
should be category 2 which that's a good
point<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:34.210> one<00:01:34.360> good<00:01:34.540> thing<00:01:34.570> about<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.990> though

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
point the one good thing about it though

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.030 
point the one good thing about it though
actually<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.560> best<00:01:35.710> thing<00:01:35.860> about<00:01:35.890> it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
actually the best thing about it

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.350 
actually the best thing about it
probably<00:01:36.250> if<00:01:36.579> you<00:01:36.729> really<00:01:36.970> want<00:01:37.119> one<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.240> these

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
probably if you really want one of these

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.149 
probably if you really want one of these
is<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.720> back<00:01:38.079> glass<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.619> good<00:01:38.829> because

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
is the back glass is good because

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.010 
is the back glass is good because
finally<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.850> back<00:01:40.000> window<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.390> this<00:01:40.509> car<00:01:40.780> is

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
finally the back window to this car is

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.310 
finally the back window to this car is
going<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.680> be<00:01:41.770> virtually<00:01:42.130> impossible<00:01:42.369> I'd<00:01:42.970> say

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
going to be virtually impossible I'd say

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.200 
going to be virtually impossible I'd say
so<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.590> think<00:01:45.159> Jim's<00:01:45.369> optimistic<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.060> two

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
so I think Jim's optimistic the two

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.310 
so I think Jim's optimistic the two
grand<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:46.540> think<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.869> found<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.079> bunch<00:01:47.200> of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
grand I think I found a bunch of

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.560 
grand I think I found a bunch of
probably<00:01:47.649> do<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.890> but<00:01:48.250> if<00:01:48.790> there's<00:01:49.479> a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
probably do it but if there's a

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.240 
probably do it but if there's a
no-reserve<00:01:49.810> car<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:50.619> no<00:01:50.680> reason<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.100> it's

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
no-reserve car is it no reason so it's
