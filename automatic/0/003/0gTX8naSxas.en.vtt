00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.890
 del delius presented by the largest 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:15.179
 sports betting arena of the world 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:17.039
 bwin 16 national players are ten days 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.600
 on a country tour this is a long one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.920
 that will probably be the time 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.939
 sports board also see this hall 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.949
 matthias sammer 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.640
 how difficult is it to do without it ? 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.099
 professionals it's not that hard for me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.469
 I think that was a bit apart 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.989
 and of course you can in the schedule 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.210
 you knew that the country games 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.690
 Now everyone is doing well 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 the players should play with theirs 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.460
 national teams also a bit 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 to come to other thoughts 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.250
 here will be with those who are there 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.969
 I work professionally 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.090
 this distance in the moment as ok and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.350
 you just have to be professional with it 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.420
 But I think that would be us 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.039
 ok succeed also because it all so 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.539
 the world cup qualification must go now times 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.700
 his tells the 10 days on the way but 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.770
 That is true of other countries and others 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 join in the same way 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.380
 yes, but I'm referring a bit more 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 the situation bavaria munich itself we 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.729
 have been built 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.530
 we went very stringent 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.320
 have consistently gone and stand 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.750
 everywhere shiny and have now 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.689
 of course after the cup play up 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.980
 leverkusen amazone had a small phase 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.120
 where you maybe like that 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 23 percent easily cough through as well 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.320
 I had to say specifically because of that 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.870
 normal for me is within one 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.570
 Season now with a little trick 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.330
 we can think of a few others 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.770
 Of course then come and especially in 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.700
 the next week and meant 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.670
 that feels the reins even then 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.140
 keep very tight on the very tight 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.060
 aligned next weeks whether they 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.280
 are serious but incredible 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 attractive tasks and must 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.099
 they are happy that they thought then 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.299
 even as they said so if the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.680
 players are back then blowing in 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.030
 others just wind up these last ones 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.049
 percent that they have missed now 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.360
 that to come primarily 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.890
 Regarding champions league it should and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.840
 but should not be interpreted that way 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.330
 as if that was something abnormal but 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.790
 I have it as something normal 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.989
 looks specifically after the game against 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.750
 borussia dortmund where the euphoria 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.319
 for my ideas a little big 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.700
 was 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.310
 I did not just say that 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.049
 medial perhaps also in our club 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.880
 and with the knowledge of which player 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.829
 pending come then hope home it 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.510
 dÃ¼sseldorf comes in all respect but 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.540
 even with the strength we have to this 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.970
 At the time we knew that we did that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
 can somehow solve a very 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.989
 good game result against arsenal 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.420
 So the next games were 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.660
 mentally you have to say maybe 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.620
 well played 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.819
 two results in the league 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.489
 or three results 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.630
 Subjects did not hurt us 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.359
 arsenal hurt us but it is 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.190
 nothing happens and we have to go next 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.500
 these are playing now checked off 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.319
 but always have the courage to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.459
 analysis what has us in this play 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.350
 then maybe not so strong 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.060
 made like in the past and that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.790
 it is important to focus on 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.799
 athletic as well as spiritual and me 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.480
 believe that we have a few 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.010
 percentage points can sit on again 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.239
 So now a little distraction 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.280
 the national team and then fuller 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.280
 Attack is all good thanks
