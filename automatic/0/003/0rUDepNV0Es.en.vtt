00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
ah I think add this basically sarong how
it<00:00:31.769> looks<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.469> wait<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:35.190> me

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.990 

yeah<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.810> feels<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.560> better

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.530 

no<00:00:50.000> different<00:00:50.510> cycle<00:00:51.040> actually<00:00:52.360> into<00:00:53.360> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
no different cycle actually into the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.890 
no different cycle actually into the
place<00:00:53.750> in<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.140> wrong<00:00:54.380> as<00:00:55.340> you<00:00:55.580> can<00:00:55.760> see<00:00:56.000> is

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
place in the wrong as you can see is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.350

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
based off cm9 I think rc1 so it's not

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.260 
based off cm9 I think rc1 so it's not
the<00:01:02.420> latest<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.230> later<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.790> RC<00:01:04.790> 2<00:01:05.000> right
