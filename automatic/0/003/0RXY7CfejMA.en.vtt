the<00:00:25.520> package<00:00:25.820> contents<00:00:26.329> up<00:00:26.419> of<00:00:26.630> serato<00:00:27.410> DJ

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
the package contents up of serato DJ

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.360 
the package contents up of serato DJ
like<00:00:28.759> a<00:00:28.790> copy<00:00:29.180> of<00:00:29.360> the<00:00:29.689> call<00:00:30.079> scratch<00:00:30.320> live<00:00:32.170> and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
like a copy of the call scratch live and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.290 
like a copy of the call scratch live and
then<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:35.860> copy<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:37.070> over<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.969> actual

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
then we copy it over to the actual

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.729 
then we copy it over to the actual
contents<00:00:39.700> of<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:42.429> scratch<00:00:43.429> live<00:00:44.379> so<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:45.620> is

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
contents of a scratch live so this is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.060 
contents of a scratch live so this is
the<00:00:45.890> old<00:00:46.190> original<00:00:46.879> scratch<00:00:47.359> live<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.070> here

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
the old original scratch live and here

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.979 
the old original scratch live and here
is<00:00:49.359> actually<00:00:50.359> serato<00:00:51.019> DJ<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.780> initially<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
is actually serato DJ and initially the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.910 
is actually serato DJ and initially the
effects<00:00:54.409> weren't<00:00:54.649> loading<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:57.559> what<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.800> did

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
effects weren't loading so what I did

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.829 
effects weren't loading so what I did
was<00:00:58.749> go<00:00:59.749> to<00:01:00.909> resources<00:01:01.909> of<00:01:02.359> a<00:01:02.510> serato<00:01:02.780> DJ

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839

Serato<00:01:15.950> Scratch<00:01:16.340> Live<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:20.300> then<00:01:20.570> one<00:01:20.780> other

saving<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.460> cross<00:01:28.790> fader<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.630> up<00:01:30.410> faders

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
saving is the cross fader and up faders

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.170 
saving is the cross fader and up faders
aren't<00:01:33.850> being<00:01:34.850> mapped<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:37.340> what<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.550> had<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.820> do

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
aren't being mapped so what I had to do

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:47.110 
aren't being mapped so what I had to do
was<00:01:38.570> go<00:01:41.560> into<00:01:42.560> my<00:01:42.740> setup<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:46.610> actually<00:01:46.760> had

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:04.380 

then<00:01:54.080> go<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.230> our<00:01:54.440> video<00:01:54.620> screen

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
and now you can see the crossfader

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.770 
and now you can see the crossfader
working<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:08.229> serato<00:02:08.530> video<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:14.319> now<00:02:14.620> it's
