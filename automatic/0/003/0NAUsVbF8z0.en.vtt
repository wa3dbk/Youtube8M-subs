table behind me i'm sure you have to get
through<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.789> slider<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.359> looks<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.779> all

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
through the slider it looks like all

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.640 
through the slider it looks like all
right<00:00:25.590> number<00:00:25.920> 13<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.420> got<00:00:27.599> three<00:00:27.960> sections

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
right number 13 you got three sections

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.080 
right number 13 you got three sections
on<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.789> slide<00:00:30.529> this<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.740> cross<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
on one slide this is cross see the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.950 
on one slide this is cross see the
vessels<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.750> trachea<00:00:34.230> than<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> nice<00:00:34.800> raise

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
vessels and trachea than the nice raise

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.619 
vessels and trachea than the nice raise
okay<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> cross<00:00:37.920> section<00:00:38.629> now

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
okay so that's a cross section now

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
okay so that's a cross section now
longitudinal<00:00:40.530> section<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.940> cells

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
longitudinal section you see the cells

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
longitudinal section you see the cells
the<00:00:42.660> tracheas<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> vessels<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> down

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the tracheas and vessels go up and down

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.119 
the tracheas and vessels go up and down
but<00:00:45.570> since<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.020> cut<00:00:46.230> through<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.920> right

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but since it's cut through the right

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
but since it's cut through the right
he's<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:48.300> across<00:00:48.860> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.899> radial

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
he's going across this is a radial

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
he's going across this is a radial
section<00:00:52.469> okay<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> Rays

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
section okay so you can see the Rays

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
section okay so you can see the Rays
going<00:00:54.239> across<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.070> rotate

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
going across all right now if I rotate

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
going across all right now if I rotate
that<00:00:56.730> sucker<00:00:57.090> 90<00:00:57.570> degrees<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> cut

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

tangential perpendicular to the Rays
once<00:01:03.210> again<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> longitudinal

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
once again see it's a longitudinal

once again see it's a longitudinal
section<00:01:05.780> these<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.590> cells

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
section these are two these little cells

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.179 
section these are two these little cells
those<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.060> Rays<00:01:09.299> coming<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
those are the Rays coming out at you so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.120 
those are the Rays coming out at you so
this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.840> tangential<00:01:12.840> section<00:01:13.439> looks<00:01:13.920> like

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this is a tangential section looks like

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.060 
this is a tangential section looks like
they're<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.820> unites<00:01:15.750> cre8<00:01:16.439> doesn't<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
they're all what unites cre8 doesn't it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.820

I think just thousand x power really i

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.030 
I think just thousand x power really i
think<00:04:15.620> that's<00:04:15.979> why<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.280> okay

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.520 
think that's why it's okay
and<00:04:17.610> it's<00:04:17.790> oil<00:04:18.090> immersion<00:04:18.390> okay<00:04:19.140> let's<00:04:19.350> get

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and it's oil immersion okay let's get

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.900 
and it's oil immersion okay let's get

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
you got to go to 40 how's that okay see

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.430 
you got to go to 40 how's that okay see
the<00:05:05.640> stomata<00:05:06.030> here<00:05:06.390> with<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.020> two<00:05:07.170> guard

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
the stomata here with the two guard

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.960 
the stomata here with the two guard
cells<00:05:07.740> what's<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.570> spongy<00:05:09.570> tissue<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.410> then

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
cells what's this spongy tissue and then

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.200 
cells what's this spongy tissue and then
two<00:05:11.970> layers<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:13.130> palisade<00:05:14.130> as<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:15.060> little

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
two layers of palisade as that little

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.750 
two layers of palisade as that little
vein<00:05:15.510> starting<00:05:16.140> there<00:05:16.320> maybe<00:05:16.530> but<00:05:17.520> here's<00:05:17.670> the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
vein starting there maybe but here's the

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.980 
vein starting there maybe but here's the
lower<00:05:18.120> epidermis<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.860> uppers<00:05:20.190> cut<00:05:20.580> off

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
lower epidermis the uppers cut off

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.930 
lower epidermis the uppers cut off
there's<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.170> lower<00:05:22.350> epidermis<00:05:22.700> looks<00:05:23.700> just

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
there's the lower epidermis looks just

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.140 
there's the lower epidermis looks just
like<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.330> upper<00:05:24.600> email<00:05:25.610> alrighty<00:05:26.610> now<00:05:26.940> this

like the upper email alrighty now this

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.720 
like the upper email alrighty now this
is<00:05:27.360> 10x<00:05:28.140> power<00:05:28.410> already<00:05:28.740> these<00:05:29.190> suckers<00:05:29.430> are

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
is 10x power already these suckers are

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.490 
is 10x power already these suckers are
small<00:05:30.090> number<00:05:30.780> 18<00:05:31.550> alright<00:05:32.550> so<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.500> epidermis

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
small number 18 alright so the epidermis

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.710 
small number 18 alright so the epidermis
looks<00:05:34.740> like<00:05:34.890> jigsaw<00:05:35.340> puzzle<00:05:35.790> pieces<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:36.630> if

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
looks like jigsaw puzzle pieces so if

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.820 
looks like jigsaw puzzle pieces so if
