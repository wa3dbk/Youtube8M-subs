00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
different than what you expected a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
school actually we try to stretch the
day<00:00:59.579> when<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.879> agreement<00:01:00.359> nice<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.840> sure

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.230 

again<00:01:13.800> what's<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> end<00:01:18.090> result

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
again what's this I think the end result

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.690 
again what's this I think the end result
being<00:01:18.479> worker<00:01:18.840> ya<00:01:19.200> doing<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> again<00:01:19.950> from<00:01:20.159> from

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
being worker ya doing it again from from

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
being worker ya doing it again from from
a<00:01:20.760> fresh<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.990> star<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.290> ill<00:01:22.409> Republicans

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
a fresh I think star was ill Republicans

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.480 
a fresh I think star was ill Republicans
won't<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.070> quite<00:01:23.250> enough<00:01:23.550> for<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.570> now

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
won't be quite enough for right now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.920 
won't be quite enough for right now
games<00:01:26.490> you'll<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.780> that's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
games you'll see I think that's that's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.290 
games you'll see I think that's that's
enough<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.380> its<00:01:29.070> hold<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> deal<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:30.060> always

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
enough for its hold it deal you always

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700 
enough for its hold it deal you always
think<00:01:30.420> oh<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.050> it<00:01:31.110> over<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> would

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
think oh if you do it over with it would

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.680 
think oh if you do it over with it would
you<00:01:31.830> different<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> learn<00:01:33.330> step

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
you different you kind of learn step

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.540 
you different you kind of learn step
along<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> mean<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.070> we're
