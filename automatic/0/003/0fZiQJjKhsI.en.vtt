Hello everybody, today I will show you not complicated but very sweet makeup

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:20.298
let’s start

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.907
At first I will need foundation and sponge

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:30.381
even out skin tone and move on to shadows

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.790
Take pink, yellow and white

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.397
Apply yellow shadow to the whole lid

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:47.807
Apply pink one to the outer eye corners

00:00:51.492 --> 00:00:53.635
And white shadow to the inner lid

00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:07.019
Also apply pink shadow to the middle of lower lid

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:24.057
Underline with black pencil outer upper and lower eye corners

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.372
With white pencil I underline inner eye corners and lower lid

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:03.034
Apply false lashes and mascara

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.619
Add some false lashes to the lower lid,

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:27.552
I take a pair of lashes and cut it in two to accent only outer corners

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.844
If you forgot eyebrows like me, just tint them, and if you already have them, just skip this step

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.848
Hide “blue eyes” with concealer

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:57.355
with beige blusher I correct the nose shape and face shape as well

00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:12.373
and face shape as well, smoothing with the powder

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.888
Highlight the cheeks with pink blusher

00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:32.756
Add some shining to the skin with my favorite highlighter

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:35.673
Apply just like that)

00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:39.308
Jist kidding, I apply to the cheeks some with the help of brush

00:03:49.493 --> 00:03:53.071
Apply some lipstick to the lower lip and smooth,

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:56.247
blend the contour with concealer,

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:05.735
And finish it with tasty lip gloss with sparkles

00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:13.353
Put on a hat and a wig,

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.581
make two buns

00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:27.581
and it`s done

00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:41.994
Thank you for watching

00:04:41.994 --> 00:04:49.706
