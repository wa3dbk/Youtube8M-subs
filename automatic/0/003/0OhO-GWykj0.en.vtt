00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 So go to the eyes of the model and what 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.800
 what was convenient to work and choose 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.410
 pen tool 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.440
 so we start neatly allocate with 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.440
 using this tool our eye 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.580
 and also do on the second eye 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.580
 neatly 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.520
 So 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.960
 and now right click the gram 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.480
 form a selection 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.030
 blending radius is approximately 2 pixels 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.810
 set click ok we go 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.750
 Now on the second layer and click 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.280
 control jay key combination 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.120
 so this layer is put here and change 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.890
 overlay mode it overlap see 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.940
 that our eyes immediately became much 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.360
 more expressively 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.920
 they got so very good 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.040
 contrast and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.880
 added depth can also be 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.530
 a little bit 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.380
 to correct them with 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.420
 adjustment layer up let's 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.200
 try choose here here 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.200
 adjustment layer curves 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.410
 so apply it only to the second layer 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.119
 To do this, hold down the alt key and click 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.000
 here here here on the border between these 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.280
 two layers so you see that we 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.530
 there was such an arrow 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.020
 This means that the adjustment layer 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.690
 attached only here to this one 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.320
 layer for so let's go into it 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:03.729
 nastroechki and you see that you can 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.030
 change eye contrast in this way 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.910
 at will when you effect 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.850
 will arrange you can click ok and close 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:20.970
 This window so look where we will be 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.100
 eyes look best like this 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.400
 so I think it looks very much 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.560
 not bad closing the window 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 if it seems to you that the effect is too 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.180
 strong can lower transparency as 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.920
 I already said you see 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.980
 and customize as you need and so 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.820
 in this way we have achieved 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.010
 so expressive 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.210
 beautiful effect on the eyes we made 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.190
 they are much more noticeable on images 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.120
 now let's see what we have with 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.080
 you were at first 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.870
 and now add these two layers in 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.330
 daddy 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.330
 choose and hobby click kontrol r so
