00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.550
 jumping that as you know is the second 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.110
 Novel published in Spanish of this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.820
 author, I commented recently that I wanted 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 make a joint reading that I will leave 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.180

 see and cheer up and all those things and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.929
 The truth is that I have so many 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.850
 you win and I think I'm looking forward 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.070
 that under the same star but good and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.929
 I'll tell you how it is from the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.940
 editorial cloud of ink that makes 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.460
 also precious editions from the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.769
 books I get this micro book that is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.629
 small in size but not thick enough 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.489
 it is the night of all the saints of and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.680
 rise is a novel that deals with the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 struggle of slavery and all that and the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 truth is that they are quite 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.920
 interesting but I do not know if the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 I will read now or the leaders within 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.440
 a few months the novel has its 850 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.840
 pages or more so it's pretty 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.230
 but the reviews that I've seen 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.450
 Bodybuilders and other websites varied the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.010
 novel is quite good and it becomes more 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.200
 enjoyable of what it looks like so I have 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.300
 hopes with androids before 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.630
 show you the book I 'll show you what 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.980
 that sent the editorial great voyage that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620
 is from the ocean publisher that is a 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.610
 editorial that is well known for 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.770
 Latin America but that in Spain goes to 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.290
 start your gaits now in this 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.300
 a little more autumnal time and the truth is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 who paint their novels very well are 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.260
 pretty interesting novels and it seems 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.000
 be that they managed to work quite well 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.220
 that you have to be vigilant they sent the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.990
 dossier this with the novelties the book 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.120
 that I have that is the one that I will teach you 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.190
 now it's the dark side of sally greene 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.620
 but what I wanted to show you is that they're going 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.810
 to publish fallen angels in football 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.460
 of susan and that as you know was this 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.680
 self published author who has sold 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 million and such and that good they are going to 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.790
 make film too so I think 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.020
 how good I will be attentive to read it 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.490
 because he really wants and nothing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.200
 disappeared who also publish it 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.690
 about the dark side of going out and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.459
 they send this little thing that good 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.960
 as a small dossier of the novel and 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.440
 two bookmarks and now they come 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.900
 a little this unboxing in quotes 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.210
 because to see it take away what is the envelope 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.010
 no but this does not take it away and I want it 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.450
 remove here in front of the camera that 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.490
 have the key here free me 17 9 like this 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.800
 that I'm going to put the key to see to see if 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.730
 it gives me you do not know to see it gives me and the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.730
 I can put the first 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.240
 a turn 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.270
 the key is already set let's see if 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.270
 works 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.950
 and it seems that no 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.950
 but yes 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.800
 is that he has moved and tries to make it 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.070
 fast than the camera 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.070
 9 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.080
 hi upside down from above up then look 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.620
 I was outraged because they have had me 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.640
 help at the end and the key was 000 that is 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.710
 great crossing 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.740
 put the keys well total thanks that 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.720
 after removing the padlock it remains like this and 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.720
 Well I hope not to break the book 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.870
 and the dark side is already released 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.150
 for what you see in the edition is not 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.840
 badly have your little girls here have their 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.370
 pretty curious things the parts of 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.470
 the novel are like this 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.239
 Hey, look, it's not bad, it's the same 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.140
 type of printing that the books of 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.730
 circle of readers 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.859
 so if you are familiar with 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.349
 they will already know as the same kind of 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.269
 cover the same type of sheet and the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.560
 same source so more or less the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.420
 you can get an idea of ​​how they are and 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.609
 good in general that I already read the novel 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.829
 so what I will do will be a rereading and 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.359
 I loved it fascinated me and I hope so 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.459
 Enjoy it as much as the first time 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.739
 I continue with a birthday gift that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.569
 although it was in May my friends so I 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.700
 gave away a little later but it does not happen 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.709
 nothing is worth it because what is taken into account is the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.940
 detail the book is my stephen series 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.889
 king did not have many very many 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.120
 very much desire is one of the novels 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.039
 from stephen king who called me the most 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.570
 attention and the truth is that the movie 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.520
 although the half-allergy was 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.370
 I like it very much, I have a lot of desire and 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.190
 that I want to read it because that with 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.080
 really want and good that thanks to me 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.760
 boyfriend and my friends for giving me the os 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.770
 tkm 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.370
 and finally this month of August I received 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.370
 one hyde 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.610
 finally I received the eighth book of the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.620
 saga pretty little yesterday is from the author 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.599
 it will always be one hit and it's a 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.819
 novel that although I have not read the 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.590
 previous surely the read is like 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.470
 very close to the seventh and the eighth 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.530
 because the saga is at a pretty point 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.389
 important enough that hooks 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.340
 quite so that's why I bought it 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.229
 I say because I'm going to read well and that's 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.669
 I hope to continue reading the saga I hope 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.110
 Keep buying books because 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.080
 they are precious is pretty and in addition 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.970
 I'm that shallow and nothing like that 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.440
 they are very cheap on the internet if you want 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.180
 read the saga for real in English that you 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.740
 open up enough money and this has been 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.990
 I hope you liked this one 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.400
