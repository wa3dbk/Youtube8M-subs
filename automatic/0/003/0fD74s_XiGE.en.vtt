all<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.319> golems<00:01:45.709> are<00:01:45.829> chasing<00:01:46.310> after<00:01:46.490> him<00:01:46.819> I

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.029 
all the golems are chasing after him I

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:49.510 
all the golems are chasing after him I
know<00:01:47.779> if<00:01:47.929> he<00:01:48.020> does<00:01:48.170> his<00:01:48.319> explosive<00:01:48.979> move<00:01:49.249> it's

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
know if he does his explosive move it's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.609 
know if he does his explosive move it's
probably<00:01:50.209> going<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.569> injure<00:01:50.929> every<00:01:51.289> single

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619
