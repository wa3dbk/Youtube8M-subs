the the feathers I painted different
colors<00:02:37.400> they're<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.720> base<00:02:38.840> colors<00:02:39.230> so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
colors they're just the base colors so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.500 
colors they're just the base colors so
this<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.330> dark<00:02:41.330> gray<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:43.490> they<00:02:44.360> can

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
this is just a dark gray and they can

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.820 
this is just a dark gray and they can
see<00:02:44.660> how<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> sort<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.380> alternating

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
see how the sort of the alternating

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.130 
see how the sort of the alternating
colors<00:02:46.100> there<00:02:46.340> look<00:02:46.580> out<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.450> tried<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.870> stay

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
colors there look out so I tried to stay

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.100 
colors there look out so I tried to stay
within<00:02:48.440> all<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.340> lines<00:02:49.640> there<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.330> there's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
within all the lines there and there's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.199 
within all the lines there and there's
sort<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.830> same<00:02:51.980> color<00:02:52.280> used<00:02:52.610> for<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
sort of the the same color used for the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.490 
sort of the the same color used for the
both<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.360> these<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.900> these<00:02:54.080> will<00:02:54.230> end<00:02:54.350> up

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
both of these and these will end up

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.900 
both of these and these will end up
looking<00:02:54.770> different<00:02:54.890> mostly<00:02:55.400> because<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
looking different mostly because of the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.210 
looking different mostly because of the
texture<00:02:56.290> there<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.980> way<00:02:58.070> that

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
texture there and in just the way that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.160 
texture there and in just the way that
you<00:02:58.280> highlight<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.209> back<00:02:59.390> area<00:03:01.930> okay<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.989> can

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
you highlight the back area okay you can

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.470 
you highlight the back area okay you can
see<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.320> same<00:03:03.590> wash<00:03:03.860> they're<00:03:04.220> getting<00:03:04.760> on<00:03:05.270> all

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
that's going to get the dark wash and

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.289 
that's going to get the dark wash and
that'll<00:03:33.950> help<00:03:34.100> bring<00:03:34.519> out<00:03:34.640> all<00:03:34.820> those<00:03:35.000> colors

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
that'll help bring out all those colors

so there you go that's what the a grass

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.759 
so there you go that's what the a grass
earth<00:03:37.489> shade<00:03:37.850> or<00:03:38.600> equivalent<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:39.560> case

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
earth shade or equivalent in this case

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.210 
earth shade or equivalent in this case
and<00:03:40.630> that'll<00:03:41.630> just<00:03:41.780> pooling<00:03:42.769> there<00:03:42.920> really

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
and that'll just pooling there really

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.750 
and that'll just pooling there really
helps<00:03:43.459> get<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.730> shadows<00:03:44.200> brought<00:03:45.200> out<00:03:45.760> and

after I washed this as I'm painting on
layers

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
trying to keep the texture of the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.680 
trying to keep the texture of the
feathers<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.890> there<00:04:19.160> it's<00:04:20.030> kind<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.269> an<00:04:20.390> over

brush technique so I'm painting most of
the<00:04:22.490> area<00:04:22.820> pretty<00:04:23.360> quickly<00:04:23.830> but<00:04:24.830> just<00:04:24.890> leaving

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
the area pretty quickly but just leaving

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.010 
the area pretty quickly but just leaving
the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
and trying to use a fine brush just to

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.460 
and trying to use a fine brush just to
get<00:04:32.889> those<00:04:33.099> those<00:04:33.910> colors<00:04:34.330> there<00:04:34.659> at<00:04:35.169> Bob

get those those colors there at Bob

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.990 
get those those colors there at Bob
viously<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.800> would<00:04:35.919> take<00:04:36.099> forever<00:04:36.460> if<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:36.819> was

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
viously this would take forever if I was

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.070 
viously this would take forever if I was
doing<00:04:37.509> every<00:04:37.840> single<00:04:38.110> detail<00:04:38.440> as<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:40.360> finely

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
doing every single detail as as finely

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.330 
doing every single detail as as finely
as<00:04:41.199> possible<00:04:41.259> so<00:04:41.770> you're<00:04:41.889> just<00:04:42.039> doing<00:04:42.280> it

really quickly just trying to get the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.170 
really quickly just trying to get the
impression<00:04:44.259> of<00:04:44.669> what<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.759> feathers<00:04:46.060> would

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
impression of what the feathers would

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.619 
impression of what the feathers would
look<00:04:46.360> like<00:04:47.729> okay<00:04:48.729> starting<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.150> highlight<00:04:49.449> up

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
look like okay starting to highlight up

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.080 
look like okay starting to highlight up
the<00:04:49.810> non<00:04:50.050> metallic<00:04:50.319> gold<00:04:50.710> there<00:04:50.949> so<00:04:51.280> just

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
getting that higher on the top edge

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.960

sorry<00:05:10.539> about<00:05:10.659> the<00:05:10.900> clock<00:05:11.470> in<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.710> background

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
sorry about the clock in the background

sorry about the clock in the background
that'll<00:05:15.039> be<00:05:15.099> done<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.460> second<00:05:15.789> okay<00:05:16.330> so

that'll be done in a second okay so
getting<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:19.270> edges<00:05:19.690> there<00:05:20.009> and<00:05:21.009> you<00:05:21.159> see

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
getting the the edges there and you see

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.189 
getting the the edges there and you see
once<00:05:21.969> you've<00:05:22.120> started<00:05:22.599> doing<00:05:22.930> this<00:05:23.050> non

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
once you've started doing this non

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.399 
once you've started doing this non
metallic<00:05:23.500> goal<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.099> it<00:05:24.310> becomes<00:05:24.909> quite

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
metallic goal that it becomes quite

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.469 
metallic goal that it becomes quite
systematic<00:05:26.409> and<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:27.669> can<00:05:27.789> see<00:05:27.969> you<00:05:28.120> pick<00:05:28.330> out

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
systematic and you can see you pick out

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.360 
systematic and you can see you pick out
the<00:05:28.539> edges<00:05:29.050> with<00:05:29.169> lightest<00:05:29.710> colors<00:05:29.979> and<00:05:30.250> then

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
the edges with lightest colors and then

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.279 
the edges with lightest colors and then
you<00:05:30.520> sort<00:05:30.699> of<00:05:30.819> blend<00:05:31.120> from<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.509> top<00:05:31.719> head<00:05:31.960> down

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
you sort of blend from the top head down

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.980 
you sort of blend from the top head down
and<00:05:32.789> leaving<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.909> lower<00:05:34.120> bits<00:05:34.599> dark<00:05:35.139> a<00:05:36.990> bit

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
and leaving the lower bits dark a bit

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.100 
and leaving the lower bits dark a bit
more<00:05:38.169> look<00:05:38.349> there<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.800> like<00:05:39.759> it<00:05:40.719> really

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
more look there and like it really

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.570 
more look there and like it really
speeds<00:05:41.409> up<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.710> lot<00:05:41.889> once<00:05:42.130> you've<00:05:42.250> done<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.430> a

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
speeds up a lot once you've done it a

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.980 
speeds up a lot once you've done it a
couple<00:05:42.610> times<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.419> because<00:05:43.690> I've<00:05:43.810> done<00:05:43.930> it

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
couple times and because I've done it

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.570 
couple times and because I've done it
for<00:05:44.169> my<00:05:44.229> whole<00:05:44.440> high<00:05:44.620> o<00:05:44.650> army<00:05:45.099> it<00:05:45.190> actually<00:05:45.490> has

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
for my whole high o army it actually has

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.749 
for my whole high o army it actually has
become<00:05:45.849> quite<00:05:46.060> manageable<00:05:47.460> okay<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:48.520> using

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
become quite manageable okay so using

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.240 
become quite manageable okay so using
some<00:05:49.060> sort<00:05:49.750> of<00:05:49.810> yellow<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.080> tones<00:05:50.740> there<00:05:51.069> and

try to paint on some of those leopard
spots<00:06:00.520> just<00:06:00.880> making<00:06:01.779> sort<00:06:02.020> of<00:06:02.080> horseshoe

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
spots just making sort of horseshoe

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.930 
spots just making sort of horseshoe
shapes<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.190> trying<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.639> keep<00:06:03.729> them

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
shapes and trying to keep them

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.719 
shapes and trying to keep them
randomized<00:06:04.870> looking<00:06:05.440> and<00:06:05.710> not<00:06:06.370> trying<00:06:06.639> to

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
randomized looking and not trying to

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.339 
randomized looking and not trying to
overdo<00:06:07.090> it<00:06:07.120> that's<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:07.779> think<00:06:07.930> that's<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.229> key

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
overdo it that's I think that's the key

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.170 
overdo it that's I think that's the key
with<00:06:08.529> things<00:06:08.710> like<00:06:08.830> that<00:06:08.979> is<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.340> little<00:06:09.909> less

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
with things like that is a little less

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.260 
with things like that is a little less
is<00:06:10.360> better<00:06:10.539> probably<00:06:11.490> okay<00:06:12.490> that's<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.940> the

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
is better probably okay that's the the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.820 
is better probably okay that's the the
guy<00:06:13.419> all<00:06:13.599> done<00:06:13.840> so<00:06:14.610> amazing<00:06:15.610> model

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
guy all done so amazing model

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.230 
guy all done so amazing model
unfortunately<00:06:17.830> I<00:06:17.860> have<00:06:18.219> a<00:06:18.430> lot<00:06:18.759> of<00:06:18.789> the<00:06:19.029> sky

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
unfortunately I have a lot of the sky

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.879 
unfortunately I have a lot of the sky
unpainted<00:06:19.779> so<00:06:20.080> I'm<00:06:20.139> not<00:06:20.229> really<00:06:20.380> sure<00:06:20.469> what<00:06:20.740> to

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
unpainted so I'm not really sure what to

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.689 
unpainted so I'm not really sure what to
do<00:06:21.039> with<00:06:21.190> all<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.580> extras<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:23.639> ended<00:06:24.639> up

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
do with all of the extras I ended up

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:25.980 
do with all of the extras I ended up
trading<00:06:25.000> for<00:06:25.240> lots<00:06:25.419> of<00:06:25.539> different<00:06:25.840> high

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
trading for lots of different high

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.279 
trading for lots of different high
offsets<00:06:26.500> and<00:06:27.389> this<00:06:28.389> one<00:06:28.569> here<00:06:28.810> I<00:06:28.840> think<00:06:29.020> I

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
offsets and this one here I think I

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.779 
offsets and this one here I think I
would<00:06:29.409> only<00:06:29.529> ever<00:06:29.680> want<00:06:29.979> one<00:06:30.159> in<00:06:30.279> the<00:06:30.310> army<00:06:30.639> but

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
would only ever want one in the army but

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.640 
would only ever want one in the army but
we'll<00:06:30.969> have<00:06:31.060> to<00:06:31.150> see<00:06:31.210> now<00:06:31.990> that<00:06:32.169> the<00:06:32.259> new<00:06:32.409> book
