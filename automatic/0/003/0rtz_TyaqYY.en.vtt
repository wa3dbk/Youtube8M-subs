00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello to all as i promised when I charge 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.040
 batteries batteries start show how 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 Here shines the flashlight 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:21.010
 Acute Sirius but the battery has engendered 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.890
 I will show you how in principle he should 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.930
 shine and the fact that when unpacking this 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.890
 torch 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:35.050
 It turned out that I do not know the match brighter 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:39.100
 burning than this small flashlight such 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.310
 Obzorchik do as he shines that much 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.050
 time to take you just right now 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:51.730
 engaged in these forms for skin 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 nazhdachki their undermines a little bit now 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.820
 I will glue looking for skin 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.370
 while there is free time we will see 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.370
 how does it shine with charged batteries 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.300
 as I said this is all metal on them 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.300
 will be visible on camera 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.420
 of course sorry for the quality of the video 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.430
 this is not a camcorder this is normal 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:36.970
 the camera is just a video we see not 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:43.200
 very good quality but 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 that's how i said apple red led flashlight 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:53.500
 So he will not see the purpose can be seen in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:58.780
 here metal now let's see it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 total protons gets out here and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:10.840
 understands it turns out honestly not even 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 disassembled, too, there are seals ring 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:21.190
 rubber thread here is so good 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:28.500
 the book is so small they are here because 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.500
 how you glue either incomprehensible and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.230
 here so how to contact 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.970
 interesting here gets out even here 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:52.780
 do you honestly give me your hands 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:56.260
 did not reach here so here 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.489
 sealing ring and so I look if 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.239
 you even screw the water well 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.970
 you can throw 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:13.139
 and here it is even directly written that 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:16.139
 this led no light bulbs here 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 Light-emitting diode 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:30.540
 huge it is interesting to unscrew no 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.230
 it's already a tighter goal 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.590
 all metal 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:47.220
 he was disassembled into three parts 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:53.220
 times more precisely more than 2-4 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:57.450
 batteries 5 let 's get it quick 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.650
 let's put it on 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:08.820
 shines and finished this my gaze then 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:20.959
 I'll start shooting as I glue the skin with a blank 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:23.959
 for fine-tuning even so plump 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.959
 twist 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.240
 that's all ready 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:52.540
 the light is what I was talking about. 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.850
 the power button in the dark glows in 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.710
 This button is very, very easy in 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.650
 dark find a flashlight of course so 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.560
 important plus is quite bright 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:13.120
 the button is on, I'm honestly on maximum 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:18.310
 in the distance I even took it in 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.789
 he shines I would say very, very 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.789
 brightly 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.069
 a big spot 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:46.280
 can even be light 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:51.100
 daytime daylight then look like 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:55.990
 he was interrupting his wife white doors 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.110
 what white spot for cars for home 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.410
 conditions 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.740
 just at home a home flashlight is very very 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.740
 not bad 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:17.070
 how was the load sitting here in general 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.070
 here is a flashlight 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.740
 the most important thing of course is that it is very 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:36.700
 durable metal flashlight is not very 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:38.800
 so small compact so here 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:48.190
 Now we are like for 5 seconds 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:51.640
 about and here's a video button is burning immediately on 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.360
 you need to take and turn on is not necessary 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.530
 grope this flashlight and see immediately 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.830
 because here there is such 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:06.340
 button and very 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:12.630
 I'll tell you this is a handy thing. All right.
