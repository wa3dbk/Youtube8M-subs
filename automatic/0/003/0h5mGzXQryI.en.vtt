00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.230
 Yonsei Medical Center opened in 1885 as Korea's first Western-style hospital 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 And the Severance Hospital in the womb 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 Manage more than 10,000 outpatients per day and more than 3,000 patients 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.449
 It is a hospital organization operated through it system. Daegu 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.100
 It's our Miyo Severance program that is running. 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.940
 We have two weeks of performance verification for each company with the Browns program in the news . 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.729
 came 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.140
 We have also adopted the VMware in terms of performance and safety. 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:56.790
 The installation itself took about 3 to 5 days, 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.860
 This is about two weeks or so and now completely working 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:05.909
 It's done, but it usually takes thousands of pc replacements if 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 In case of a very short period of time 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.950
 It was a very good experience without any work to be done. 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.390
 There continues to grow very thick and large the biggest problem for the management about 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.110
 The best part of that is that after I had the nursery, 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.040
 Desk management cost has been reduced by 30% 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.580
 Flashy'm actually decreased over 30% in the number of service requests 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.760
 I doeguyo think there was a very efficient at managing daeseuta 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.880
 This vdi solution 2 not only on a typical pc, but also on a smartphone 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.570
 Real real-time career and possible 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.729
 There was a lot of demand for mobile related programs 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:52.350
 4 Re-developing the program related to the mobile again is a huge cost 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:56.640
 So I'll go into the fact deulyigo not the cost of the short-term 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.049
 There are also ways to solve this problem using desktop virtualization 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.540
 It is most effective to use PC to answer 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:12.120
 Even when it is not the time, you can use groupware by using mobile phone, 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.299
 By checking and confirming your work, you will receive great convenience and prompt notice 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.549
 It was great to know as soon as I was there . 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:25.769
 Anytime, anywhere , depending on the situation, 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:26.700
 It allows you to participate in the treatment directly to the emergency room. 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.739
 The point. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.790
 Ubiquitous health care that is really needed for every patient 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.940
 I can not tell you the affliction of the client as much as 320 times now 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.340
 There are operations using the client agent 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.370
 Oil is also a lot of language text towers , the cost of introduction, electricity or 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.690
 These parts have been saved a lot. 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.100
 We are very satisfied with the introduction of the desktop and 4r . 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 Especially, many employees are positively thinking about introducing one. 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.460
 I'm thinking. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.230
 Inside the hospital, it is a voluntary aspect or a cost aspect. 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.770
 This helps a lot like doengeot 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.770
 Thank you
