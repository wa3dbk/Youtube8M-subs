first method I'm going to show you is
crafting<00:00:19.989> golden<00:00:20.560> bracelets<00:00:21.189> so<00:00:22.180> you're

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
crafting golden bracelets so you're

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.150 
crafting golden bracelets so you're
going<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.419> need<00:00:22.599> a<00:00:22.869> bunch<00:00:23.169> of<00:00:23.349> gold<00:00:23.529> bars<00:00:23.800> and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
going to need a bunch of gold bars and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.909 
going to need a bunch of gold bars and
you're<00:00:24.550> going<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.700> need<00:00:24.880> your<00:00:25.060> bracelet<00:00:25.689> mold

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
you're going to need your bracelet mold

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.190 
you're going to need your bracelet mold
so<00:00:26.919> we're<00:00:27.279> going<00:00:27.399> to<00:00:27.460> go<00:00:27.579> over<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:28.200> falador

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
so we're going to go over to falador

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.679 
so we're going to go over to falador
because<00:00:29.500> that's<00:00:29.770> where<00:00:30.009> I<00:00:30.040> usually<00:00:30.369> go<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.790> do

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
because that's where I usually go to do

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.990 
because that's where I usually go to do
my<00:00:31.840> smelting<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:32.980> crafting<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:33.670> whatnot

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
my smelting and crafting and whatnot

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000 
my smelting and crafting and whatnot
that<00:00:34.300> has<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.450> do<00:00:34.630> with<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.809> furnace

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
that has to do with the furnace

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.840 
that has to do with the furnace
so<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> head<00:00:38.430> over<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so we're going to head over to the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
so we're going to head over to the
furnace<00:00:39.240> so<00:00:39.810> the<00:00:39.900> reason<00:00:40.020> why<00:00:40.230> crafting<00:00:40.860> gold

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
furnace so the reason why crafting gold

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.190 
furnace so the reason why crafting gold
bracelets<00:00:41.580> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> good<00:00:42.090> form<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.660> making<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
bracelets is a good form of making a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.770 
bracelets is a good form of making a
profit<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.800> raising<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.730> crafting<00:00:45.420> skill

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
profit and raising that crafting skill

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
profit and raising that crafting skill
is<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.220> buy<00:00:47.340> gold<00:00:47.550> bars<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.270> a
