much<00:00:30.029> slack<00:00:30.509> difference<00:00:30.989> there<00:00:31.200> is<00:00:31.320> between

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
much slack difference there is between

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.380 
much slack difference there is between
the<00:00:33.120> two<00:00:33.739> types<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.910> end<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:38.390> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the two types so at this end I have the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.170 
the two types so at this end I have the
car<00:00:40.200> boys<00:00:40.500> lined<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.370> end<00:00:41.580> of<00:00:41.820> a

car boys lined up with the end of a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.350 
car boys lined up with the end of a
ruler<00:00:42.740> so<00:00:43.740> don't<00:00:43.890> push<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> kiddies<00:00:44.520> back<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
ruler so don't push the kiddies back to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970 
ruler so don't push the kiddies back to
give<00:00:45.540> him<00:00:45.630> some<00:00:45.810> today<00:00:46.530> take<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.830> all<00:00:46.950> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
other way again and you'll see that they

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
other way again and you'll see that they
are<00:01:03.360> completely<00:01:03.660> compressed<00:01:04.140> all<00:01:04.860> the

couplers are completely depressed and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.090 
couplers are completely depressed and
first<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.360> letting<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.440> takes

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
first thing when letting go is it takes

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
first thing when letting go is it takes

like impression out makes about an

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.110 
like impression out makes about an
eighth<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> inch<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.100> stretch<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.760> full

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
eighth of inch if I stretch it to full

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.440 
eighth of inch if I stretch it to full
length<00:01:15.750> until<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:17.280> includable<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:17.970> slack<00:01:18.240> in

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
the drivetrain of the engine as well I

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.360 
the drivetrain of the engine as well I
goes<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:24.170> zero<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.710> focus<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
goes from zero so I'm gonna focus on

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.080 
goes from zero so I'm gonna focus on
that<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:27.710> yes<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:28.830> zero<00:01:29.220> mark<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that there yes from zero mark at the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
that there yes from zero mark at the
pilot<00:01:30.299> beam<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:31.909> about<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.940> half<00:01:33.090> inch<00:01:34.100> now

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pilot beam to about a half inch now

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.380 
pilot beam to about a half inch now
compare<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:37.940> sergeant<00:01:38.940> couple<00:01:39.330> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
compare that to the sergeant couple of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
compare that to the sergeant couple of
train<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:42.600> stretches<00:01:43.080> very<00:01:43.970> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
train and it stretches very in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.940 
train and it stretches very in
significantly<00:01:45.600> let's<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.740> about

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
significantly let's see it's going about

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.300 
significantly let's see it's going about
oh<00:01:48.380> that's<00:01:49.380> gonna<00:01:49.590> less<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.369> ties<00:01:50.780> one

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
oh that's gonna less than one ties one

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.250 
oh that's gonna less than one ties one
fold<00:01:53.310> maybe<00:01:53.580> one<00:01:53.790> full<00:01:54.060> time<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:55.020> tiny

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
fold maybe one full time little tiny

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.240 
fold maybe one full time little tiny
little<00:01:55.470> tie<00:01:57.439> do<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> difference<00:01:59.070> there

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
little tie do you see a difference there

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
little tie do you see a difference there
it's<00:01:59.430> quite<00:01:59.759> quite<00:02:00.210> obvious<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.020> look

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
it's quite quite obvious one you look

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's quite quite obvious one you look
down<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.950> length<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> train<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:04.670> polkas

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
down the length of the train and polkas

down the length of the train and polkas
daughter<00:02:05.939> though<00:02:06.270> she's<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.750> yeah<00:02:07.220> looks

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
daughter though she's not yeah looks

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.009 
daughter though she's not yeah looks
like<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.090> pushing<00:02:09.299> on<00:02:09.689> the<00:02:09.810> flat

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
like it now so I'm pushing on the flat

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.429 
like it now so I'm pushing on the flat

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
cars on both both trains and you can see

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.240 
cars on both both trains and you can see
the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the

the
significant<00:02:16.250> difference<00:02:16.610> you'll<00:02:16.849> be<00:02:16.940> hiding

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
significant difference you'll be hiding

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.820 
significant difference you'll be hiding
down<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.599> way<00:02:17.750> no<00:02:18.050> significant<00:02:18.530> difference

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
down this way no significant difference

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.680 
down this way no significant difference
between<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.220> trains<00:02:19.489> as<00:02:19.700> far<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.060> how<00:02:20.269> much<00:02:20.510> in

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
between the trains as far as how much in

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.960 
between the trains as far as how much in
the<00:02:20.720> news<00:02:21.129> now<00:02:22.129> that's<00:02:22.310> really<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.549> problem<00:02:22.700> one

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the news now that's really a problem one

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.170 
the news now that's really a problem one
with<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> other<00:02:23.269> just<00:02:25.180> interesting
