00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
game you'll see why soon because it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
game you'll see why soon because it
shows<00:00:57.230> like<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> green<00:00:58.800> flash<00:00:59.489> around<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
shows like a green flash around you and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
shows like a green flash around you and
your<00:01:00.719> player<00:01:01.379> says<00:01:01.920> dialogue<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.579> your

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
your player says dialogue like your

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
your player says dialogue like your
character<00:01:02.910> says<00:01:03.239> dialogues<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> extremely

character says dialogues and extremely
notes<00:01:05.040> something<00:01:05.369> legitimate<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> takes

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
notes something legitimate but it takes

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
notes something legitimate but it takes
12<00:01:06.390> times<00:01:06.770> there<00:01:07.770> now<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
12 times there now I think this is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
12 times there now I think this is
something<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.909> nine<00:01:11.240> or<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.290> think

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
something like nine or actually I think

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
something like nine or actually I think
those<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.460> may<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.670> been<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:14.939> point

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
those that may have been was on point

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.260 
those that may have been was on point
probably<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> am<00:01:17.100> great<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.790> it's

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
probably well I am great I think it's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
probably well I am great I think it's
this<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.630> coming<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:20.130> you

now<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.620> about<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.860> speed<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.520> quick

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
now that is about the speed of quick

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.969 
now that is about the speed of quick
revive<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.420> haven't<00:01:36.960> stopped<00:01:37.260> watched<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.800> it
