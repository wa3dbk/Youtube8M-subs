00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.440 
of death first generation 40 gig now I
thought<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.490> was<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.940> clever<00:01:03.150> here

it my hard drive in vacati when you do
this<00:02:36.060> how<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.329> make<00:02:36.510> sure<00:02:36.629> all<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.780> hard<00:02:36.989> drive

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
this how to make sure all the hard drive

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.289 
this how to make sure all the hard drive
does<00:02:37.709> not<00:02:37.950> touch<00:02:38.129> any<00:02:38.459> way<00:02:38.609> underneath<00:02:38.909> which

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
thinks it doesn't perfectly go and then

00:02:45.169 --> 00:03:04.630 
thinks it doesn't perfectly go and then
jump<00:02:46.169> amount<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:48.109> got<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.260> in

it<00:03:05.210> won't<00:03:05.390> go<00:03:05.480> any<00:03:05.569> further<00:03:05.900> invent<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.380> needs

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
it won't go any further invent it needs

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.400 
it won't go any further invent it needs
to<00:03:06.740> and<00:03:07.060> what<00:03:08.060> I've<00:03:08.150> done<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.630> I've<00:03:08.810> used<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.260> be

to and what I've done is I've used to be

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.130 
to and what I've done is I've used to be
tiny<00:03:10.220> little<00:03:11.209> clip<00:03:11.510> used<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.870> get<00:03:11.990> with<00:03:12.110> the
