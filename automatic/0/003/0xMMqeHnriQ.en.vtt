00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
alongside in mystery there were also

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.210 
alongside in mystery there were also
many<00:01:25.350> difficulties<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.909> looked<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.220> hour

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
many difficulties we looked at the hour

many difficulties we looked at the hour
tide<00:01:29.939> computer<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> said<00:01:31.110> minus<00:01:31.890> 1<00:01:32.130> degree

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110

tide computer and it said minus 1 degree
that's<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.890> cold<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:36.030> dive<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.509> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that's pretty cold for a dive and it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.969 
that's pretty cold for a dive and it
should<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.670> impossible<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
should really be impossible to have that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.039 
should really be impossible to have that
cold<00:01:41.250> water<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> actually<00:01:42.360> turns<00:01:42.840> him

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
cold water because it actually turns him

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.630 
cold water because it actually turns him
to<00:01:43.229> ice<00:01:43.880> silver<00:01:44.880> degrees<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.890> could<00:01:47.100> be

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to ice silver degrees but that could be

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.539 
to ice silver degrees but that could be
explained<00:01:48.210> by<00:01:48.329> by<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.680> movement<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.369> the

explained by by the movement of the
water<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:51.329> some<00:01:52.140> strange<00:01:52.680> phenomenon

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
water also some strange phenomenon

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.510 
water also some strange phenomenon
occurred<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.299> main<00:01:54.780> objective<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.920> dye<00:01:56.130> was

occurred a main objective of the dye was
to<00:01:56.729> film<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> object<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> yet<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> camera

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to film the object and yet the camera

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.889 
to film the object and yet the camera
stopped<00:01:59.399> working<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.479> approached

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
stopped working when they approached

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.060 
stopped working when they approached
objects<00:02:01.590> why<00:02:01.979> isn't<00:02:02.969> anything<00:02:03.299> working

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
objects why isn't anything working

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.240 
objects why isn't anything working
anything<00:02:05.070> electrical<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.250> satellite

200 meters it turned on again and what

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.180 
200 meters it turned on again and what
we<00:02:20.550> got<00:02:20.730> back<00:02:20.940> over<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> objects<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.190> didn't
