the place people seem to think that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
threat detection UAV this is not true

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
threat detection UAV this is not true
the<00:00:34.140> thing<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> keeps<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> threat

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the thing that keeps you off of a threat

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
the thing that keeps you off of a threat
detection<00:00:36.000> UAV<00:00:36.480> that's<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:36.930> where<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
detection UAV that's the one where you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
detection UAV that's the one where you
can<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.500> people<00:00:37.920> through<00:00:38.129> walls<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
can see people through walls from the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
can see people through walls from the
UAV<00:00:39.780> itself<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> module<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.760> low

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
UAV itself from that module it's low

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.540 
UAV itself from that module it's low
profile<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.260> keeps<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.710> off<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.309> our

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
profile that's what keeps you off of our

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
profile that's what keeps you off of our
makes<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.539> can't<00:00:46.379> see<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.710> through

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
makes it so they can't see you through

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
makes it so they can't see you through
those<00:00:47.160> walls<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.020> would<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.410> sense

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
those walls it kind of would make sense

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.709 
those walls it kind of would make sense
if<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> were<00:00:50.190> cold-blooded<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.910> sounds<00:00:51.600> like

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
if it were cold-blooded it sounds like

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.790 
if it were cold-blooded it sounds like
it<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> description<00:00:52.500> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it like from the description of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.229 
it like from the description of
cold-blooded<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> everything<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> sounds

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
cold-blooded and everything it sounds

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
cold-blooded and everything it sounds
like<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.510> should<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.840> cold-blooded<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
like it should be cold-blooded that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
like it should be cold-blooded that
keeps<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.300> it's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
keeps you off of that but it's not it's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840 
keeps you off of that but it's not it's
low<00:00:58.109> profile<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> there's<00:00:59.070> still<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.489> ton<00:00:59.520> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
low profile and there's still a ton of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
low profile and there's still a ton of
people<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
people out there that don't know this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889 
people out there that don't know this
and<00:01:01.800> they'll<00:01:02.280> argue<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.300> quite<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and they'll argue with me for quite a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
and they'll argue with me for quite a
long<00:01:03.960> time<00:01:04.580> insisting<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
long time insisting that it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.070 
long time insisting that it's
cold-blooded<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.450> keeps<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> off<00:01:06.869> when

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.719 
cold-blooded that keeps you off when
it's<00:01:07.200> definitely<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> am<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.340> showing

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's definitely not so I am also showing
you<00:01:08.909> proof<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.650> game<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you proof right here in this game of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
you proof right here in this game of
urban<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.060> set<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> classes

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
urban right now I set up the classes

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.020 
urban right now I set up the classes
this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> playing<00:01:13.890> against<00:01:14.130> bots<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.520> set<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> up

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
this is playing against bots I set it up

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
this is playing against bots I set it up
so<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> only<00:01:15.689> class<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.229> could<00:01:16.380> use<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so the only class that you could use is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.649 
so the only class that you could use is
this<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.630> see

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this one right here and as you can see

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
this one right here and as you can see
cold-blooded<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.830> low<00:01:20.159> profile<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.820> on

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
cold-blooded is on low profile is not on

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
cold-blooded is on low profile is not on
and<00:01:21.509> i'm<00:01:21.630> using<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.049> threat<00:01:22.290> detection<00:01:22.619> UAV

threat detection grenades at them it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
threat detection grenades at them it
does<00:01:35.220> protect<00:01:35.460> them<00:01:35.759> from<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.689> cold

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
this is on compound I just changed that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
this is on compound I just changed that
same<00:01:48.119> class<00:01:48.390> very<00:01:48.720> slightly<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> took<00:01:49.320> off

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619

same class very slightly I took off
cold-blooded<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:50.490> added<00:01:50.670> low<00:01:50.939> profile<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
cold-blooded and i added low profile so

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
cold-blooded use low profile so I know

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
cold-blooded use low profile so I know
that<00:02:21.239> was<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:21.660> quick<00:02:21.900> tip<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.170> today
