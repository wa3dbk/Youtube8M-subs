00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
sports title for the 3do but for me it

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.560 
sports title for the 3do but for me it
just<00:04:21.470> lacks<00:04:21.949> a<00:04:22.190> little<00:04:22.610> bit<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:23.000> keeps<00:04:23.419> it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
just lacks a little bit that keeps it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.290 
just lacks a little bit that keeps it
from<00:04:23.600> being<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:24.110> really<00:04:24.470> great<00:04:24.680> game<00:04:25.150> for<00:04:26.150> one

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
from being a really great game for one

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.629 
from being a really great game for one
thing<00:04:26.510> this<00:04:26.720> game<00:04:26.960> lacks<00:04:27.290> an<00:04:27.500> NBA<00:04:27.830> license<00:04:28.340> so

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
thing this game lacks an NBA license so

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.980 
thing this game lacks an NBA license so
you<00:04:28.699> don't<00:04:28.910> have<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.210> real<00:04:29.389> players<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
you don't have the real players in the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.260 
you don't have the real players in the
game<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:31.070> doesn't<00:04:31.430> really<00:04:31.580> bother<00:04:31.820> me<00:04:32.000> much

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
game this doesn't really bother me much

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.090 
game this doesn't really bother me much
but<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.720> can<00:04:32.930> see<00:04:33.110> why<00:04:33.229> someone<00:04:33.470> might<00:04:33.710> not<00:04:33.889> like

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
but I can see why someone might not like

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.310 
but I can see why someone might not like
it<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.430> don't<00:04:35.240> know<00:04:35.300> if<00:04:35.419> it's<00:04:35.540> fair<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.990> stack

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
it I don't know if it's fair to stack

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.680 
it I don't know if it's fair to stack
this<00:04:36.500> up<00:04:36.710> against<00:04:37.070> NBA<00:04:37.310> Jam<00:04:37.880> but<00:04:38.510> in

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
this up against NBA Jam but in

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.290 
this up against NBA Jam but in
comparison<00:04:39.100> slamming<00:04:40.100> Jam<00:04:40.340> just<00:04:40.760> feels<00:04:41.030> a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
comparison slamming Jam just feels a

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.659 
comparison slamming Jam just feels a
little<00:04:41.330> bland<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:42.139> me<00:04:42.250> when<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.280> remember

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
little bland to me when I remember

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.570 
little bland to me when I remember
playing<00:04:43.940> NBA<00:04:44.540> Jam<00:04:44.960> on<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.199> Atari<00:04:45.500> Jaguar<00:04:45.710> it

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
playing NBA Jam on the Atari Jaguar it

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.070 
playing NBA Jam on the Atari Jaguar it
just<00:04:46.850> seemed<00:04:47.090> like<00:04:47.210> with<00:04:47.510> each<00:04:47.630> new<00:04:47.810> player

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
just seemed like with each new player

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.020 
just seemed like with each new player
you<00:04:48.289> try<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.650> were<00:04:48.919> discovering<00:04:49.460> new<00:04:49.580> dunks

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
you try you were discovering new dunks

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.600 
you try you were discovering new dunks
whereas<00:04:50.810> with<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.080> game<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.710> seemed<00:04:52.220> like<00:04:52.460> it

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
whereas with this game it seemed like it

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.279 
whereas with this game it seemed like it
didn't<00:04:52.850> take<00:04:52.970> long<00:04:53.210> before<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.780> felt<00:04:54.020> like<00:04:54.169> I

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
didn't take long before it felt like I

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.159 
didn't take long before it felt like I
had<00:04:54.380> seen<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.770> all<00:04:55.090> Plus<00:04:56.090> everything<00:04:56.539> in<00:04:56.810> NBA

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
had seen it all Plus everything in NBA

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.170 
had seen it all Plus everything in NBA
