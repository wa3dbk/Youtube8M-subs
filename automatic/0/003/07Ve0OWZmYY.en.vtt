finish<00:00:05.100> product<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.700> two<00:00:05.910> raccoons<00:00:06.300> today<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
finish product is two raccoons today and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.930 
finish product is two raccoons today and
garbage<00:00:07.290> can<00:00:07.529> have<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.830> dinner<00:00:08.099> now<00:00:08.670> let's

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
garbage can have a dinner now let's

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.160 
garbage can have a dinner now let's
begin<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.420> look<00:00:09.570> at<00:00:09.720> the<00:00:09.809> mechanism

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
begin to look at the mechanism

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.650 
begin to look at the mechanism
I<00:00:12.400> always<00:00:13.400> try<00:00:13.670> to<00:00:13.700> design<00:00:14.090> the<00:00:14.150> handle<00:00:14.540> to

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
I always try to design the handle to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.060 
I always try to design the handle to
reflect<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:15.140> piece<00:00:15.320> on<00:00:15.500> building<00:00:15.830> in<00:00:15.980> this

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
reflect the piece on building in this

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.620 
reflect the piece on building in this
case<00:00:16.310> it's<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.610> bone<00:00:16.760> from<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.090> garbage<00:00:17.450> a

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
case it's a bone from the garbage a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.970 
case it's a bone from the garbage a
directional<00:00:18.080> arrow<00:00:18.230> helps<00:00:18.620> point<00:00:18.800> the

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
directional arrow helps point the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
directional arrow helps point the
direction<00:00:19.370> to<00:00:19.460> turn

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
direction to turn

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.870 
direction to turn
this<00:00:22.440> is<00:00:22.620> the<00:00:22.710> main<00:00:22.890> part<00:00:23.190> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> mechanism

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
this is the main part of the mechanism

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.930

turn the heads and you can see the shaft

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.979 
turn the heads and you can see the shaft
that<00:03:11.819> makes<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.150> little<00:03:12.359> mouse<00:03:12.480> on<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.750> front

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
that makes a little mouse on the front

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.300 
that makes a little mouse on the front
cup<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.470> down<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.829> big<00:03:13.980> wheel<00:03:14.129> on<00:03:14.220> the

finally this is how the whole mechanism

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.250 
finally this is how the whole mechanism
works<00:03:20.910> when<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.270> all<00:03:21.390> together<00:03:21.600> well<00:03:22.170> the
