alright so this is going to be the first
in<00:00:10.430> a<00:00:10.850> handful<00:00:11.389> of<00:00:11.450> upgrade<00:00:12.410> videos<00:00:12.799> I'm<00:00:13.040> going

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
in a handful of upgrade videos I'm going

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.230 
in a handful of upgrade videos I'm going
to<00:00:13.250> upload<00:00:14.120> soon<00:00:14.570> I<00:00:14.809> will<00:00:15.799> be<00:00:15.980> making<00:00:16.309> a<00:00:16.610> memory

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
to upload soon I will be making a memory

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.929 
to upload soon I will be making a memory
upgrade<00:00:17.450> to<00:00:17.840> my<00:00:17.960> laptop<00:00:18.439> it<00:00:19.130> already<00:00:19.340> has<00:00:19.550> four

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
upgrade to my laptop it already has four

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.359 
upgrade to my laptop it already has four
gigs<00:00:20.119> of<00:00:20.390> memory<00:00:20.540> which<00:00:20.840> is<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.080> max<00:00:21.369> however

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
gigs of memory which is the max however

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.740 
gigs of memory which is the max however
it<00:00:22.430> does<00:00:22.550> not<00:00:22.700> have<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.000> fastest<00:00:23.509> memory

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
it does not have the fastest memory

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.260 
it does not have the fastest memory
possible<00:00:24.470> it<00:00:24.619> has<00:00:26.619> ddr2<00:00:27.619> 667<00:00:28.460> installed<00:00:29.060> right

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
possible it has ddr2 667 installed right

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.130 
possible it has ddr2 667 installed right
now<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:30.050> I<00:00:30.140> will<00:00:30.200> be<00:00:30.500> installing<00:00:30.950> ddr2<00:00:32.140> 800

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
now and I will be installing ddr2 800

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.900 
now and I will be installing ddr2 800
which<00:00:33.980> is<00:00:34.070> significantly<00:00:34.700> faster<00:00:36.280> pc2<00:00:37.280> 6400

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910

upgrade hardware components because it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.620 
upgrade hardware components because it
has<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.740> make<00:03:39.890> sure<00:03:39.920> all<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.580> drivers<00:03:41.240> work

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
after you first upgrade hardware and see

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.110 
after you first upgrade hardware and see
the<00:03:54.560> bios<00:03:54.860> was<00:03:55.040> able<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.430> load<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.760> just<00:03:55.910> fine

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the bios was able to load it just fine

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.360 
the bios was able to load it just fine
it<00:03:56.300> didn't<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:56.570> any<00:03:56.750> problem<00:03:57.170> it's<00:03:58.040> already

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
it didn't have any problem it's already

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.520 
it didn't have any problem it's already
starting<00:03:58.700> windows<00:03:59.000> so<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.840> far<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:03.140> seems<00:04:03.170> to

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
starting windows so so far it seems to

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.150 
starting windows so so far it seems to
be<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.800> nice<00:04:04.040> successful<00:04:04.750> replace<00:04:06.010> upgrade<00:04:07.010> of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
be a nice successful replace upgrade of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.690 
be a nice successful replace upgrade of
memory

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.640 

already<00:04:14.450> when<00:04:14.660> does<00:04:14.780> seven<00:04:15.080> professionals

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.699 
already when does seven professionals
loaded<00:04:16.989> actually<00:04:17.989> did<00:04:18.109> not<00:04:18.139> take<00:04:18.440> all<00:04:18.590> that

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
loaded actually did not take all that

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.229 
loaded actually did not take all that
long<00:04:18.769> probably<00:04:19.430> because<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:19.760> has<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:20.030> same

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
long probably because it has the same

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:31.370 
long probably because it has the same
amount<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.690> memory<00:04:20.900> it's<00:04:21.169> just<00:04:21.350> faster

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.070 

seems<00:04:32.220> you're<00:04:32.400> taking<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:33.660> bit<00:04:33.870> longer

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
seems you're taking a little bit longer

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.490 
seems you're taking a little bit longer
once<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:34.410> log<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:36.170> really<00:04:37.170> not<00:04:37.290> all<00:04:37.470> that

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
once you log in but really not all that

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.780 
once you log in but really not all that
bad<00:04:38.060> I'm<00:04:39.060> not<00:04:39.240> sure<00:04:39.300> maybe<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.870> takes<00:04:40.050> some

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
bad I'm not sure maybe it takes some

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.100 
bad I'm not sure maybe it takes some
longer<00:04:41.790> when<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.120> upgrade<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.720> amount<00:04:42.960> of

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
longer when you upgrade the amount of

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.600 
longer when you upgrade the amount of
memory<00:04:43.290> but<00:04:43.560> not<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> speed<00:04:44.130> because<00:04:44.580> it

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
memory but not the speed because it

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.820 
memory but not the speed because it
might<00:04:44.850> have<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.210> have<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.110> operating<00:04:46.470> system

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
might have to have the operating system

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.640 
might have to have the operating system
figure<00:04:47.100> out<00:04:47.250> how<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.430> utilize<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:49.050> different

faster slightly larger hard drive and I

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.140 
faster slightly larger hard drive and I
would<00:05:16.170> just<00:05:16.290> like<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.710> say<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.640> quick<00:05:17.790> thank<00:05:17.880> you

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
would just like to say a quick thank you

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.520 
would just like to say a quick thank you
at<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.390> end<00:05:18.480> for<00:05:18.540> my<00:05:18.750> dad<00:05:18.930> who<00:05:19.110> ordered<00:05:19.410> these

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
parts for me this will just be a short

parts for me this will just be a short
little<00:05:21.720> clip<00:05:22.290> you<00:05:22.470> can<00:05:22.620> see<00:05:22.830> right<00:05:22.860> there<00:05:23.310> that

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
megs of memory and if you know how to do

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.600 
megs of memory and if you know how to do
the<00:05:30.780> calculation<00:05:31.380> 4096<00:05:32.390> actually<00:05:33.390> counts<00:05:33.780> for

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
the calculation 4096 actually counts for

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.310 
the calculation 4096 actually counts for
60<00:05:35.610> gigabytes<00:05:35.790> so<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:36.720> can<00:05:36.870> see<00:05:37.050> with<00:05:37.170> all<00:05:37.290> the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
60 gigabytes so you can see with all the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.290 
60 gigabytes so you can see with all the
formatting<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:38.280> is<00:05:38.370> actually<00:05:38.580> utilizing

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
formatting it is actually utilizing

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.330 
formatting it is actually utilizing
quite<00:05:39.600> a<00:05:39.630> bit<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.080> memory<00:05:40.410> I've<00:05:40.890> seen<00:05:41.130> some

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
quite a bit of the memory I've seen some

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.310 
quite a bit of the memory I've seen some
people's<00:05:41.670> computers<00:05:42.150> with<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:42.390> 64-bit

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
people's computers with a 64-bit

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.440 
people's computers with a 64-bit
operating<00:05:43.590> system<00:05:44.060> using<00:05:45.060> way<00:05:45.180> less<00:05:45.420> than

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
operating system using way less than

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.800 
operating system using way less than
that<00:05:45.690> when<00:05:45.990> they<00:05:46.080> have<00:05:46.230> four<00:05:46.560> gigs<00:05:47.250> installed

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
that when they have four gigs installed

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.570 
that when they have four gigs installed
so<00:05:48.810> yep<00:05:49.530> you<00:05:49.650> can<00:05:49.800> see<00:05:49.950> it's<00:05:50.070> already<00:05:50.220> good<00:05:50.460> to

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
so yep you can see it's already good to

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.700 
so yep you can see it's already good to
go
