00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.710 
I'll have distance tests coming up soon
but<00:02:22.090> I'm<00:02:22.599> not<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.019> do<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.260> today

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
but I'm not going to do that today

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:51.170 
but I'm not going to do that today
find<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> right

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.580 

that's<00:02:52.180> what<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> doors<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.989> windows<00:02:53.140> all

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that's what the doors and windows all

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:13.830 
that's what the doors and windows all
shut

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.390 

like<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.960> said<00:03:15.020> I'm<00:03:15.740> not<00:03:15.800> going<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.280> do<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
like I said I'm not going to do a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430 
like I said I'm not going to do a
distance<00:03:16.880> test<00:03:17.180> today<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:18.230> will<00:03:18.320> be

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
distance test today but that will be

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.390 
distance test today but that will be
coming<00:03:18.710> up<00:03:19.300> sometime<00:03:20.950> hopefully<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.160> won't<00:03:22.280> be

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
coming up sometime hopefully I won't be

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.510 
coming up sometime hopefully I won't be
using<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.760> crappy<00:03:22.970> camera<00:03:23.390> while<00:03:23.540> I'm<00:03:23.630> doing<00:03:23.870> it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.040 

all<00:03:28.520> right<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.910> guess<00:03:29.120> they<00:03:29.300> sound<00:03:29.540> pretty<00:03:29.690> good

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
all right I guess they sound pretty good

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.370 
all right I guess they sound pretty good
they're<00:03:30.350> pretty<00:03:30.560> loud<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:32.330> am<00:03:32.780> going<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.200> put

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
they're pretty loud I am going to put

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.790 
they're pretty loud I am going to put
some<00:03:33.530> capacitors<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.460> them<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:36.110> block<00:03:36.350> out<00:03:36.560> all

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
some capacitors on them to block out all

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.540 
some capacitors on them to block out all
the<00:03:38.140> low-frequency<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:40.400> they're

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
the low-frequency because they're

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.110 
the low-frequency because they're
getting<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.820> little<00:03:41.030> bit<00:03:41.150> distorted<00:03:41.750> from<00:03:41.900> that

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
getting a little bit distorted from that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.340 
getting a little bit distorted from that
so<00:03:44.120> after<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.510> I'll<00:03:44.720> make<00:03:44.870> some<00:03:45.170> distance

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
so after that I'll make some distance

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.340 
so after that I'll make some distance
