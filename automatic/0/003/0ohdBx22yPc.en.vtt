00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.970
 they see the plantain and they do not know your value 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.219

 there and we suffer all that a cockiness 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.020
 add a little more butter 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.870
 because this would be like cooking the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.790
 butter not to fry it add 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.619
 a little less fat and remain as 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.810
 that once they soften they're 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.280
 tenderies that are cooked what we are going 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.630

 You can go with everything and aluminum foil 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.729
 because it will not enter the oil is a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.620
 way of cooking just like what

 oil will not be to contrast oil 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.780
 like the mentions with the breast but 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.970

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.629

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.290
