00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
just spring off the face they just it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.820 
just spring off the face they just it
just<00:02:02.400> gets<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.150> there<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.830> it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
just gets right up there and it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
distance as well I forget the distance
it<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.870> further<00:02:19.080> than<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.320> expected<00:02:19.860> as<00:02:20.010> well

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
it was further than I expected as well

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.430 
it was further than I expected as well
yeah<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> bit<00:02:21.120> thicker<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.840> thought<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.140> was

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
yeah a bit thicker and I thought I was

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.479 
yeah a bit thicker and I thought I was
gonna<00:02:22.530> hate<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.920> thought<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.250> gonna<00:02:23.370> be

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
gonna hate it I thought it's gonna be

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.740 
gonna hate it I thought it's gonna be
too<00:02:23.640> hard<00:02:23.910> off<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.060> face<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.540> they're<00:02:24.630> not

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
too hard off the face but they're not

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.449 
too hard off the face but they're not
actually<00:02:24.930> they're<00:02:25.260> really<00:02:25.350> soft<00:02:25.709> which<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.220> I

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
actually they're really soft which is I

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.670 
actually they're really soft which is I
wasn't<00:02:27.150> expecting<00:02:27.690> at<00:02:27.780> all<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.110> they're<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
wasn't expecting at all but they're the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.620 
wasn't expecting at all but they're the
currently<00:02:28.980> good<00:02:29.100> distance<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.630> manageable

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
currently good distance and manageable

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.150 
currently good distance and manageable
flight<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.019> viruses<00:02:31.410> which<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.980> good

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
flight of viruses which is good

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.880 
flight of viruses which is good
especially<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.610> wind
