00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.110
 hi my name is alexey i am 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.539
 company engineer video max and today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 I will tell you about such a high 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.770
 reliable we do not serve the solution saw 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.019
 maksis and our production and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.029
 video technologies used in it max 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.769
 m is an unattended computer with 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.470
 intel core i7 processor 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 its main purpose is building 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.279
 CCTV systems in heavy 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 conditions namely where it is very dirty 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.880
 dusty cold or hot with like 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.540
 can see he is missing 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.450
 fans 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.830
 it allows to increase service life 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.140
 eliminates the need for maintenance 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.910
 so how exactly is the cooling fan like 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 rule fails first 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.450
 Queue surveillance required 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 significant disk volumes 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 storage space for video archives 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.360
 when using hard drives 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.890
 server class large volume we 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.430
 face the challenge of strong 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.770
 heating 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 information carriers and since this 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.060
 the solution is not service and not 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.009
 implies the installation of fans 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.020
 hard drive cooling problem 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.549
 unsolvable by standard means 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 let's do a little experiment 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.350
 To begin, measure the temperature of the disk 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.480
 subsystems under conditions at temperature 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 environment 26 degrees without 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.260
 additional cooling as seen 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.850
 disk temperature even at such 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.740
 outside temperature is behind 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 limit of normal operating range 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 if we neglect this fact as 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.320
 comes in and which manufacturer then 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.840
 disc life will be short and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 cry when developing this solution 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 we had a difficult task 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.360
 there was a lot of heat dissipation from the disks 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.580
 suggested options and even more 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.799
 the tests performed in the end 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.690
 having fulfilled all possible ways we 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 stopped on the most effective of them 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.370
 this is the peltier element the peltier element 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 thermoelectric converters in 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.640
 which when leaking 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.830
 current temperature difference occurs 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.840
 simple words when passing 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.700
 electric current through this circuit 1 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.369
 strange element will absorb heat 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 other allocate however from idea to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.299
 the realization was coming a very long way 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.189
 on which we are faced with new 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.920
 difficulties and for effective removal 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.789
 heat and efficiency of the system 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.860
 cooling were undertaken by us 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.120
 special measures and developed 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.120
 unique design solutions 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.569
 I want to note that it is warm 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.849
 removed from hard drives through 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.069
 the peltier element on the main radiator is not 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.760
 affects the operation of the computer as a whole so 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.380
 like a radiator 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 due to its design very 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.690
 effectively dissipates heat into the surrounding 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 medium to illustrate efficiency 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.640
 cooling solutions we have developed 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.160
 drives take video max video server and 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.709
 sam and put it in an insulated cabinet 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.050
 this cabinet is specially made for 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.660
 testing similar solutions in it 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.000
 installed climate control system 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.890
 maintaining the set temperature but 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.030
 from words to deeds 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.370
 expose in the closet temperature 30 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.350
 degrees after the cabinet warmed up 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.959
 look at the temperature readings 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.120
 sensor inside the hard disk as seen 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.760
 even at ambient temperature 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.110
 above 30 degrees disk subsystem 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.090
 not overheated 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.100
 operated in normal heat 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.900
 mode and it all becomes possible 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.580
 even in the absence of any 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.100
 fans and other systems 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.680
 mechanical cooling is significantly 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.600
 increases reliability and service life 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.489
 equipment item peltier is so 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.890
 effective in certain modes and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.200
 operating conditions may turn into 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.660
 in an emergency refrigerator to avoid 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.859
 hypothermia us was designed 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.109
 special microprocessor and module 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.760
 thermoregulation which controls 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.500
 disk temperature conditions 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.660
 system and controls the operation of the element 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.670
 peltier turns on and off and in 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.130
 depending on the temperature you see 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.140
 which are often nontrivial and difficult 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.430
 solutions we use to and develop 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.590
 video maks equipment 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.760
 everything is done in order to enhance 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.410
 their effectiveness 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.410
 reliability and create advanced solutions 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.980
 most fully meet the requirements 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.459
 modern market in cctv 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.459
 Thanks for attention
