to<00:00:43.429> handle<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.940> bike<00:00:44.120> because<00:00:44.420> it's<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:44.840> rocky

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
to handle the bike because it's so rocky

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.220 
to handle the bike because it's so rocky

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
very useful it's very useful to practice

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.669 
very useful it's very useful to practice
here<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:56.420> food<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:56.870> good<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:59.199> yeah<00:01:00.199> normally

the<00:01:00.800> weather<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.190> good<00:01:01.960> but<00:01:02.960> in<00:01:03.140> someone<00:01:03.530> might

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the weather is good but in someone might

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.180 
the weather is good but in someone might
be<00:01:03.859> too<00:01:04.010> hot<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.610> today<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.900> day<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.140> ok<00:01:06.530> we

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
be too hot and today the day is ok we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.560 
be too hot and today the day is ok we
are<00:01:07.370> staying<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.730> little<00:01:07.820> long<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.120> we<00:01:08.480> are

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
are staying a little long so we are

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.470 
are staying a little long so we are
staying<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:08.960> two<00:01:09.080> weeks<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.760> we<00:01:10.760> came<00:01:11.150> to

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
staying for two weeks and we came to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.720 
staying for two weeks and we came to
train<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.080> World<00:01:12.440> Championships<00:01:13.040> which

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
train for the World Championships which

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.180 
train for the World Championships which
will<00:01:13.940> be<00:01:14.060> here<00:01:14.270> in<00:01:14.300> Israel<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.380> August<00:01:15.860> I

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
will be here in Israel in in August I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.460 
will be here in Israel in in August I
think<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.880> makes<00:01:17.060> sense<00:01:17.180> because<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.900> get<00:01:18.410> a

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
think it makes sense because you get a

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.560 
think it makes sense because you get a
feeling<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.430> maps<00:01:19.640> are<00:01:19.760> may<00:01:19.940> get<00:01:20.180> made<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
feeling the maps are may get made and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.570 
feeling the maps are may get made and
what<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.050> terrain<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.070> what's

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
what the terrain is like and what's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.550 
what the terrain is like and what's
special<00:01:22.850> about<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.110> should<00:01:24.350> make

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
special about it and if you should make

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.370 
special about it and if you should make
some<00:01:24.800> adjustments<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.700> bike<00:01:25.910> so<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:27.140> think

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
some adjustments to the bike so I think

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.520 
some adjustments to the bike so I think
it's<00:01:27.970> quite<00:01:28.970> good<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.570> go<00:01:29.930> there<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.380> it's

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's quite good to go there and it's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.010 
it's quite good to go there and it's
also<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.130> course<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:32.060> was<00:01:32.210> cold<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:32.630> wet<00:01:32.750> but

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
also of course it was cold and wet but

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.560 
also of course it was cold and wet but
it's<00:01:33.140> still<00:01:33.320> warmer<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.210> warmer<00:01:35.210> than<00:01:35.450> in

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
it's still warmer and warmer than in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:52.190 
it's still warmer and warmer than in
Austria<00:01:35.930> take<00:01:36.560> my<00:01:36.740> hand

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.260 

here<00:01:53.200> most<00:01:53.470> trails<00:01:53.770> are<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> bit<00:01:54.190> are<00:01:54.369> big<00:01:54.640> but

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
here most trails are a bit are big but

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.670 
here most trails are a bit are big but
still<00:01:55.479> difficult<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:56.020> write<00:01:56.170> because<00:01:56.470> there

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
still difficult to write because there

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.609 
still difficult to write because there
are<00:01:56.770> many<00:01:56.920> rocks<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:58.690> it's<00:01:58.869> very<00:01:59.290> bumpy

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
are many rocks and so it's very bumpy

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.249 
are many rocks and so it's very bumpy
but<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.310> like<00:02:00.549> it<00:02:00.729> they're<00:02:01.390> quite<00:02:01.750> difficult<00:02:01.960> to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
but I like it they're quite difficult to

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.880 
but I like it they're quite difficult to
ride<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.119> maybe<00:02:04.299> better<00:02:04.600> for<00:02:04.869> full<00:02:05.170> suspension

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
ride so maybe better for full suspension

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.260 
ride so maybe better for full suspension
bike<00:02:06.430> then<00:02:06.729> for<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.030> hardtail<00:02:07.600> but<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:09.340> really

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
bike then for a hardtail but I really

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.210 
bike then for a hardtail but I really
enjoy<00:02:10.509> writing<00:02:10.660> here<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.230> enjoyed<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.010> very

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
enjoy writing here I enjoyed it very

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.790
