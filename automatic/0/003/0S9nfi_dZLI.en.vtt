wood at the University of Oregon and
it's<00:02:29.160> uh<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.640> grounded<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.900> public

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
it's uh it's grounded in the public

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.670 
it's uh it's grounded in the public
trust<00:02:31.620> doctrine<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.280> Commons<00:02:32.670> law<00:02:32.850> which<00:02:33.209> are

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
trust doctrine and Commons law which are

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.199 
trust doctrine and Commons law which are
super<00:02:34.680> old<00:02:34.830> laws<00:02:35.190> are<00:02:35.430> actually<00:02:35.760> fundamental

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
super old laws are actually fundamental

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.070 
super old laws are actually fundamental
to<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> Constitution<00:02:36.990> oh<00:02:37.110> yeah<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
to the Constitution oh yeah and the the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.750 
to the Constitution oh yeah and the the
approach<00:02:40.080> basically<00:02:40.560> says<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.640> our

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
approach basically says that that our

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.860 
approach basically says that that our
governments<00:02:42.120> actually<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> legal

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
governments actually have the legal

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.840 
governments actually have the legal
responsibility<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.250> consider<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
atmosphere as a public trust and this

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.690 
atmosphere as a public trust and this
this<00:02:48.959> doctrine<00:02:49.560> has<00:02:49.739> been<00:02:49.920> used<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.340> behalf<00:02:50.550> of

like specific areas of land and water

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.680 
like specific areas of land and water
but<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.400> never<00:02:53.640> actually<00:02:53.910> been<00:02:54.209> been<00:02:54.480> used

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
but it's never actually been been used

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.180 
but it's never actually been been used
on<00:02:54.810> behalf<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> atmosphere<00:02:55.590> as<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> whole
