00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.190 

to<00:01:01.520> use<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:01.880> as<00:01:02.060> a<00:01:02.090> wheel<00:01:02.330> of<00:01:02.360> course<00:01:02.720> you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
to use this as a wheel of course you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.650 
to use this as a wheel of course you
need<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.410> center<00:01:03.920> for<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:05.120> easiest<00:01:05.420> way

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
wheels are not very attractive as they

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.819 
wheels are not very attractive as they
are<00:03:51.829> because<00:03:52.730> they've<00:03:52.910> got<00:03:53.060> square<00:03:53.389> edges<00:03:53.829> so

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
are because they've got square edges so

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.830 
are because they've got square edges so
the<00:03:54.950> application<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.730> bit<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.030> sandpaper

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.980 

and<00:04:25.370> here's<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.060> wheel<00:04:26.210> after<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:26.810> been

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and here's the wheel after it's been

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:35.230 
and here's the wheel after it's been
rounded<00:04:27.500> on<00:04:27.770> both<00:04:28.010> sides<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.120> the
