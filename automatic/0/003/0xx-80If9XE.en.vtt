so<00:00:14.800> we<00:00:14.920> basically<00:00:15.250> take<00:00:15.610> our<00:00:16.269> different

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
so we basically take our different

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.410 
so we basically take our different
sorted<00:00:17.500> glass<00:00:17.710> by<00:00:18.100> color<00:00:18.369> into<00:00:19.000> different

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
sorted glass by color into different

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.560 
sorted glass by color into different
totes<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:21.430> bring<00:00:21.670> them<00:00:21.760> in<00:00:21.940> dump<00:00:22.300> them<00:00:22.449> into

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
totes we bring them in dump them into

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.359 
totes we bring them in dump them into
the<00:00:22.660> hopper<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:23.439> this<00:00:23.590> case<00:00:23.859> it<00:00:24.010> happens<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.279> be

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
the hopper in this case it happens to be

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.990 
the hopper in this case it happens to be
clear<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.830> we<00:00:26.980> have<00:00:27.160> some<00:00:27.550> brown<00:00:27.760> and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
clear and here we have some brown and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.900 
clear and here we have some brown and
green<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.560> we<00:00:29.590> just<00:00:29.859> simply<00:00:30.039> load<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.519> hopper

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
green so we just simply load the hopper

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.069 
green so we just simply load the hopper
and<00:00:31.029> then<00:00:33.269> we<00:00:34.269> could<00:00:34.420> have<00:00:34.449> shoot<00:00:34.659> this<00:00:34.809> video

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
and then we could have shoot this video

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.430 
and then we could have shoot this video
so<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.379> can<00:00:35.710> give<00:00:35.889> you<00:00:35.979> a<00:00:36.039> sound<00:00:36.339> perspective

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so you can give you a sound perspective

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.129 
so you can give you a sound perspective
so<00:00:39.449> everything<00:00:40.449> comes<00:00:40.569> up<00:00:40.809> through<00:00:41.019> that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:41.139 
so everything comes up through that

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:44.639 
so everything comes up through that
conveyor<00:00:41.530> into<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.719> discharge<00:00:44.109> chute<00:00:44.350> into

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
conveyor into the discharge chute into

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.610 
conveyor into the discharge chute into
the<00:00:44.739> hammers

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the hammers

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.500 
the hammers
breaks<00:00:47.620> up<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.799> glass<00:00:48.089> comes<00:00:49.089> into<00:00:49.389> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
breaks up the glass comes into the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.609 
breaks up the glass comes into the
trommel<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.850> tumbles<00:00:52.269> it<00:00:52.389> the<00:00:53.319> finished

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
trommel it tumbles it the finished

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.079 
trommel it tumbles it the finished
product<00:00:53.949> goes<00:00:54.069> down<00:00:54.280> into<00:00:54.489> here<00:00:54.760> into<00:00:54.969> these

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
product goes down into here into these

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.930 
product goes down into here into these
tubs<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:57.699> we<00:00:57.879> then<00:00:58.359> inventory<00:00:58.839> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:01:00.670> we

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
tubs which we then inventory and then we

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.140 
tubs which we then inventory and then we
also<00:01:01.119> have<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:02.229> discharge<00:01:02.789> chute<00:01:03.789> here<00:01:03.969> where

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
also have the discharge chute here where

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.450 
also have the discharge chute here where
all<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.330> paper<00:01:04.770> and<00:01:05.770> that<00:01:06.009> kind<00:01:06.219> of<00:01:06.280> stuff

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
all the paper and that kind of stuff

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.230 
all the paper and that kind of stuff
comes<00:01:06.700> out<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:08.740> bits<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.700> metals<00:01:10.060> and

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
comes out so little bits of metals and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.630 
comes out so little bits of metals and
lids<00:01:10.509> and<00:01:10.840> things<00:01:11.079> like<00:01:11.229> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
lids and things like that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.740 
lids and things like that
so<00:01:12.640> what<00:01:13.000> we're<00:01:13.149> gonna<00:01:13.210> do<00:01:13.479> is<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:14.500> run<00:01:15.750> this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
so what we're gonna do is is run this

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.510 
so what we're gonna do is is run this
sample<00:01:17.229> through<00:01:17.380> for<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.649> show<00:01:18.189> you<00:01:18.219> what<00:01:18.460> it

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
sample through for you show you what it

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.529 
sample through for you show you what it
sounds<00:01:18.670> like<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.710> then<00:01:21.210> normally<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.270> put<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
sounds like and then normally I put the

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.330 
sounds like and then normally I put the
vacuum<00:01:22.689> on<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.140> which<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.649> dust<00:01:23.859> suppressant

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
vacuum on it which is a dust suppressant

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.240 
vacuum on it which is a dust suppressant
looks<00:01:24.640> very<00:01:24.909> very<00:01:25.090> well<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.070> meantime

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
looks very very well in the meantime

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.609 
looks very very well in the meantime
let's<00:01:27.820> start<00:01:28.060> her<00:01:28.149> up<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.420> run<00:01:28.570> this<00:01:28.750> see<00:01:29.590> what

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
let's start her up and run this see what

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.880 
let's start her up and run this see what
it<00:01:29.770> sounds<00:01:29.859> like<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:30.310> we<00:01:30.549> put<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.789> trommel<00:01:31.149> on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it sounds like so we put the trommel on

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.700 
it sounds like so we put the trommel on
then<00:01:32.890> we<00:01:32.979> put<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.249> pull<00:01:33.429> very

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.190 

and<00:01:36.190> then<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.460> conveyor

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.899 

so<00:01:39.710> it'll<00:01:39.890> give<00:01:40.009> us<00:01:40.040> an<00:01:40.220> idea<00:01:40.549> of<00:01:40.670> what<00:01:40.820> it

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
so it'll give us an idea of what it

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.010 
so it'll give us an idea of what it
sounds<00:01:41.090> like<00:01:41.299> as<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.380> can<00:01:42.530> see<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:44.570> products

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
sounds like as you can see the products

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.300 
sounds like as you can see the products
coming<00:01:45.200> out<00:01:45.350> here

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.640 

and<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.000> labels<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.600> paper<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.140> caps<00:01:53.380> are

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
and the labels of paper and caps are

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.880 
and the labels of paper and caps are
going<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.830> be<00:01:53.890> coming<00:01:54.070> out<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.460> way

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.219 

and<00:01:58.370> basically<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:59.060> want<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.480> hear<00:01:59.690> what

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.070 

the<00:02:04.409> machine<00:02:04.710> sounds<00:02:05.130> like

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
the machine sounds like

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.510 
the machine sounds like
I<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.040> little<00:02:08.310> folder

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.300 

it's<00:02:14.450> basically<00:02:14.930> just

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.700 

glass<00:02:18.380> bottles<00:02:19.380> jars

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:39.640 

later<00:02:22.340> on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 

so<00:02:40.159> you<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.370> see<00:02:40.549> it's<00:02:40.670> not<00:02:40.879> a<00:02:40.909> super<00:02:41.330> loud

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
so you can see it's not a super loud

00:02:41.480 --> 00:03:13.059 
so you can see it's not a super loud
machine

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.740 

normally<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.790> would<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.180> back.you<00:03:14.390> wire

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
normally I would have the back.you wire

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.890 
normally I would have the back.you wire
to<00:03:15.019> stop<00:03:15.260> back

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
to stop back

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.440
