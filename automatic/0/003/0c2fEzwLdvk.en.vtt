00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.429
 At this point we have finished the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.970
 step 1 and 2 we are going to read step 3 and what 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.820
 let's execute 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.740
 well step 3 asks us to create a 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.660
 new layer called guides using the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.400
 respects line with a thickness of 4 pixels 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.529
 use a color through a projection 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.200
 of the port of the Cape as well as 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.550
 it shows and rather I recommend it 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.250
 better to use a group because 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.140
 what is photoshop cs 6 is a bit more 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.440
 difficult that in the cs5 version and you want 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.350
 4 create 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.350
 traced on the same layer we are going to 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 create a group called guides to do 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 a little easier and we started 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.240
 and the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.660
 line tool has as method 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:03.620
 abbreviated the key 1 I already have it pre 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.650
 presented with a magenta color already 4 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.550
 pixels without filling 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.010
 all right 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.440
 remember to pass a tool 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 to another because the line tool is 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.060
 well down inside what are you 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.640
 tools that go the tools of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.979
 stroke 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.800
 they are fine well well down then with 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.770
 chips and um to pass without needing 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.740
 have to enter the whole range well 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.510
 let's start let's try to do the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.180
 projection this is not something that is 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.400
 completely necessary to be but it is a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.460
 good practice to make a good 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.660
 designer is practically necessary 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.000
 to be able to create predictions of 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.880
 elements that we are going to use to 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.470
 create a line you just give a click 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.830
 at the starting point they want to 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.400
 start the line and 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.560
 from there they hold it 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.490
 but first let's grow this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.700
 chef that I have here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 let's use the tool move and 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.840
 we give you control 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.840
 and we make it grow 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.820
 in theory it 's fine we go with the other 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.240
 guide again the line tool and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.860
 we do what I was explaining to them 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 the part that you want me to start 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.120
 in the line to the point where you 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.600
 they need it to end and we're going to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.310
 go stretching in this case I did not throw them 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.140
 proportionally because the other side already 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 is large then the one that requires the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.630
 on one side like I do with the branch with 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.910
 the move control tool presses you 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.470
 the shift key I go to the corner that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.360
 is the one I want to stretch with the key 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.569
 which is pressed 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.269
 and it is already 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.799
 let's create the other cam guide the 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.010
 same procedure that we have been 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.010
 doing 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.689
 again 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.049
 as he just grew up from this corner 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.510
 then just that one with chip pressed and 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.689
 here we go 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.870
 you have to create this projection of this 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.870
 here 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.300
 here and we drag 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.670
 good point we want to get 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.960
 again with pressed chips we have 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.830
 to do the same 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.830
 What we want 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.340
 let's 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.460
 create this forgiveness I'm here is if not 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.090
 lack 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.090
 create it 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.140
 we do not make it grow 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.300
 using the shift key this one was left 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.770
 a little detached where are we going to 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.780
 use the selection tool 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.770
 direct that has as method has 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.260
 shone the key 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.550
 and let's see if we can some 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.550
 way followers 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.980
 here look how they can see the building 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.540
 it is not completely straight 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.540
 It has a kind of curve 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.470
 more than everything we need in the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.760
 projections to understand how it is that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.379
 goes 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.379
 and this would be 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.980
 step number 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.489
 completed 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.889
 well at this point we have already done 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.039
 three steps we are going to perform what is the 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.500
 step number four I have already hidden what 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.629
 which is right now the guides layer not 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.050
 let's occupy I'll hide everything that 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:48.530
 is the group guides 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.060
 well let's read what is step number 4 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.710
 says that we duplicate the difficult layer 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.650
 because you get to make some mistake and 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.970
 block and hide the cape dificio back in 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.550
 some lines in the middle part of 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.830
 building in the new layer created that is 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.110
 about the copy building layer using 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.110
 the pen tool let's see 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.150
 so here we have the building let's go 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.070
 to duplicate it to duplicate it we just go 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.150
 to press control jo command j if 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.070
 we're in mac and I'm going to block the layer 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.710
 fictional 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.139
 I choose the cap building cop and I approach and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.710
 I'm going to create him 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:31.740
 the square that they ask for there more or less 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.740
 that square walks in what they are 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.960
 four or three flame window lines 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.169
 let's review it right here it's good that 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.050
 get close enough and try to be 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.000
 quite precise with the stroke 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.150
 so that it looks a little more real 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.990
 let's see are 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.990
 with a 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.190
 two three four shelf lines here 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.270
 we have 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.270
 from the first 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.090
 at this point that cheat a little bit 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.090
 eye 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.500
 who who won a young title 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.020
 and let's go 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:21.470
 plotting this point and we're going to 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:24.160
 count 1 2 3 4 for here you must finish 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.160
 my layout 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.970
 here 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.970
 and that being a bit precise 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:43.190
 and then only what is mine here are already 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.920
 we already have the block well 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.990
 let's see to see interpret says 3 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.760
 using the pen tool you can 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.440
 use to paint us cortex processor to 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.900
 selection of trans expression control 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.420
 hot or command drop and name the layer 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.820
 created block 1 then today I'm over 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.290
 lacap building copy I'm not on the 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.170
 building because about the building I'm not going 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.400
 to be able to buy anything I will not save 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.620
 power because it's obviously is 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.050
 blocked I'm already in building copy of 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.190
 enter control 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.969
 and then command j or control j 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.480
 and I already have this layer 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:21.440
 this layer is called 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.440
 block 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.240
 all right 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.939
 How strange that it looks like that to me 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.370
 like to see the issues seats we're going 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:33.310
 to go to ballots 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:38.560
 when the jons and we are going to give it 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:41.139
 medium or large and dull that I can already 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.949
 see it like I like to see it see 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:47.770
 exactly what do I have right now 

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:51.180
 we have block one and with that we have 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.180
 finished what is step number 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.980
 4
