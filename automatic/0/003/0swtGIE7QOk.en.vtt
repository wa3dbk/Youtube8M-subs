00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
cheapo Brinkmann i modded it didn't seem

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.380 
cheapo Brinkmann i modded it didn't seem
to<00:00:12.840> hold<00:00:13.139> any<00:00:13.320> heat<00:00:15.260> so<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.730> made<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.880> dapper

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to hold any heat so I made these dapper

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.650 
to hold any heat so I made these dapper
holes<00:00:19.039> one<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.160> each<00:00:20.310> side<00:00:20.340> right<00:00:21.240> here

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
holes one on each side right here

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
holes one on each side right here
I<00:00:21.980> just<00:00:22.980> riveted<00:00:23.400> them<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:26.510> added<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I just riveted them on I added this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
I just riveted them on I added this
temperature<00:00:28.140> gauge<00:00:29.210> alright<00:00:30.769> okay<00:00:32.600> and<00:00:34.190> last

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
temperature gauge alright okay and last

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.639 
temperature gauge alright okay and last
but<00:00:35.430> more<00:00:35.700> importantly<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.630> added<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> whole

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
but more importantly I added this whole

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.369 
but more importantly I added this whole
bottom<00:00:38.070> here<00:00:38.809> they<00:00:39.809> didn't<00:00:40.050> come<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
bottom here they didn't come with the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.750 
bottom here they didn't come with the
bottom<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.070> open

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
bottom it was open

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.790 
bottom it was open
and<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.899> thought<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.770> just

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and I just thought that that was just

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.020 
and I just thought that that was just
ridiculous

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
ridiculous

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.910 
ridiculous
too<00:00:45.600> much<00:00:45.780> air<00:00:45.989> flow<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> got<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.430> bottom

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
too much air flow so I got this bottom

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
too much air flow so I got this bottom
from<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.760> flea<00:00:51.210> market<00:00:51.660> or

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
from I think the flea market or

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.299 
from I think the flea market or
something<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.379> 10<00:00:52.680> bucks<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
something like that for 10 bucks is the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
something like that for 10 bucks is the
old<00:00:53.520> old<00:00:53.760> smoker<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> pretty<00:00:55.800> good

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
yeah I made it just like a weber where i

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.950 
yeah I made it just like a weber where i
try<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.610> give<00:01:49.060> me<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.149> minute<00:01:49.299> let<00:01:49.539> me<00:01:49.570> lift<00:01:49.780> it

up<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:55.119> here's<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.830> more<00:01:57.100> important

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
up see here's the the more important

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.410 
up see here's the the more important
part<00:01:57.819> I<00:01:58.030> think<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.929> this<00:02:00.000> charcoal<00:02:01.000> bottom

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
part I think is this charcoal bottom

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.730 
part I think is this charcoal bottom
that<00:02:02.259> controls<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.310> air<00:02:03.490> flow<00:02:03.819> and<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:05.170> made

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
that controls the air flow and I made

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.529 
that controls the air flow and I made
this<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.399> on<00:02:06.610> Weber<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.149> want<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.390> buy<00:02:07.509> a

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
this is on Weber if you want to buy a

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.210 
this is on Weber if you want to buy a
Weber<00:02:07.869> one<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.289> like<00:02:08.350> forty<00:02:08.830> dollars

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
Weber one it's like forty dollars

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.940 
Weber one it's like forty dollars
ridiculous<00:02:09.910> right

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
ridiculous right

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.960

probably<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> inch<00:02:58.459> all<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.519> way<00:02:59.730> around

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
probably like a inch all the way around

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.280 
probably like a inch all the way around
when<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.390> put<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.690> people<00:03:01.019> top<00:03:01.349> on<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:04.080> fix

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
when you put the people top on so to fix

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.250 
when you put the people top on so to fix
that<00:03:04.440> problem<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:07.910> made<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> slit<00:03:09.629> all<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
that problem I just made a slit all the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.000 
that problem I just made a slit all the
way<00:03:10.380> down<00:03:10.680> here<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:12.620> don't<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.830> can

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
way down here I don't know if you can

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.819 
way down here I don't know if you can
see<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.340> look<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:15.660> what<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.170> did<00:03:16.410> was<00:03:16.590> is

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
see that look and then what I did was is

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.850 
see that look and then what I did was is
like<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.690> squeezed<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.930> together<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.590> little

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
like I squeezed this together a little

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.729 
like I squeezed this together a little
bit<00:03:20.099> and<00:03:20.370> kind<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.849> hugged<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.810> top<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
bit and kind of hugged the top and the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.330 
bit and kind of hugged the top and the
bottom<00:03:22.920> here<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.360> way<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:25.160> there's<00:03:26.160> no

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
bottom here so that way now there's no

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.120 
bottom here so that way now there's no
air<00:03:26.610> coming<00:03:26.880> through<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.450> bottom<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:29.099> just

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
air coming through the bottom and I just

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.780 
air coming through the bottom and I just
riveted<00:03:29.760> these<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.209> here<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.640> can

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
riveted these right here but as you can

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.420 
riveted these right here but as you can
see<00:03:33.950> when<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.040> put<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> lid<00:03:35.579> on<00:03:35.930> there's<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
see when you put the lid on there's the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.460 
see when you put the lid on there's the
gap<00:03:38.700> closed<00:03:40.430> considerably<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.900> I'm<00:03:43.139> hoping

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
gap closed considerably so I'm hoping

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.370 
gap closed considerably so I'm hoping
that's<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.510> big<00:03:45.510> factor<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
that's going to be a big factor and the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.930 
that's going to be a big factor and the
good<00:03:46.590> cooking<00:03:47.069> today<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.519> going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.730> cook

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
good cooking today I'm going to cook

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.370 
good cooking today I'm going to cook
some<00:03:48.829> brisket<00:03:49.829> let's<00:03:50.069> see<00:03:50.220> how<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.400> comes<00:03:50.670> out

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
some brisket let's see how it comes out

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.099 
some brisket let's see how it comes out
and<00:03:52.380> that's<00:03:52.530> my<00:03:52.799> break<00:03:53.069> when<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:54.600> can<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.930> it

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
and that's my break when you can do it

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.319 
and that's my break when you can do it
too
