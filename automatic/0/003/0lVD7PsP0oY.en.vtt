have our chess set that's opened up as

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.799 
have our chess set that's opened up as
you<00:00:37.670> can<00:00:37.790> see<00:00:37.970> there's<00:00:38.180> multiple<00:00:38.660> materials

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
you can see there's multiple materials

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.410 
you can see there's multiple materials
and<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.620> white<00:00:39.800> background<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.730> again

recenter<00:00:42.290> our<00:00:42.410> viewport<00:00:42.850> now<00:00:43.850> all<00:00:44.630> of<00:00:44.690> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
recenter our viewport now all of the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.720 
recenter our viewport now all of the
materials<00:00:45.680> are<00:00:45.800> listed<00:00:46.130> in<00:00:46.219> this<00:00:46.370> big<00:00:46.550> long

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
materials are listed in this big long

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.400 
materials are listed in this big long
list<00:00:47.030> on<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.360> side<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.809> they're<00:00:48.260> all

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
list on the side and they're all

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.069 
list on the side and they're all
represented<00:00:49.040> by<00:00:49.160> little<00:00:49.399> triangles<00:00:50.090> off<00:00:50.329> this

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
represented by little triangles off this

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.139 
represented by little triangles off this
main<00:00:51.350> node<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:52.160> kind<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.399> difficult<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.940> work

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
main node it's kind of difficult to work

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.750 
main node it's kind of difficult to work
with<00:00:53.210> them<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.660> way<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.280> what<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.610> have

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
with them that way and so what we have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.580 
with them that way and so what we have
is<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:55.969> material<00:00:56.300> picker<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.020> will<00:00:57.170> allow<00:00:57.559> us

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
is a material picker that will allow us

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.779 
is a material picker that will allow us
to<00:00:57.879> click<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.030> isolate<00:00:59.600> each<00:01:00.260> material

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
to click and isolate each material

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.680 
to click and isolate each material
individually<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.000> if<00:01:02.059> i<00:01:02.149> wanted<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.480> click

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
individually so if i wanted to click

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.259 
individually so if i wanted to click
just<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.110> red<00:01:03.350> chess<00:01:03.620> piece<00:01:03.949> i<00:01:04.219> click<00:01:05.030> there

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
just this red chess piece i click there

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.060 
just this red chess piece i click there
and<00:01:05.299> i<00:01:05.449> can<00:01:05.600> see<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.899> materials<00:01:06.619> called<00:01:06.799> red

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
and i can see the materials called red

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.709 
and i can see the materials called red
set<00:01:07.399> if<00:01:07.609> i<00:01:07.729> click<00:01:07.939> over<00:01:08.240> here<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:08.600> the

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
set if i click over here in the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.739 
set if i click over here in the
background<00:01:09.229> or<00:01:09.529> on<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.799> floor<00:01:09.950> or<00:01:10.579> on<00:01:10.749> the

background or on the floor or on the
different<00:01:12.079> pieces<00:01:12.259> i<00:01:12.560> can<00:01:12.770> quickly<00:01:13.009> jump<00:01:13.159> to

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
different pieces i can quickly jump to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.940 
different pieces i can quickly jump to
those<00:01:13.670> materials<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.420> work<00:01:14.600> with<00:01:14.779> them<00:01:14.959> now

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
those materials and work with them now

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.309 
those materials and work with them now
if<00:01:16.130> materials<00:01:16.700> are<00:01:16.850> hidden<00:01:17.119> behind<00:01:17.840> other

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
if materials are hidden behind other

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.109 
if materials are hidden behind other
materials<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.039> can<00:01:19.069> use<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:19.579> middle<00:01:19.819> mouse

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
materials you can use the middle mouse

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.239 
materials you can use the middle mouse
button<00:01:20.149> and<00:01:20.719> it<00:01:21.319> will<00:01:21.349> bring<00:01:21.499> up<00:01:21.649> a<00:01:21.799> list<00:01:21.829> that

button and it will bring up a list that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.699 
button and it will bring up a list that
will<00:01:22.459> allow<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:22.819> to<00:01:22.969> select<00:01:23.209> them<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:23.929> even

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
will allow you to select them so even

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.169 
will allow you to select them so even
though<00:01:24.829> there<00:01:24.979> are<00:01:25.069> multiple<00:01:25.399> materials<00:01:25.670> and

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
though there are multiple materials and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.629 
though there are multiple materials and
objects<00:01:26.539> stacked<00:01:26.869> up<00:01:27.109> if<00:01:27.349> I<00:01:27.499> middle<00:01:28.039> clicked<00:01:28.369> I

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
objects stacked up if I middle clicked I

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.059 
objects stacked up if I middle clicked I
was<00:01:29.359> able<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.899> come<00:01:30.079> bring<00:01:30.259> up<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.499> list<00:01:30.529> and

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
was able to come bring up a list and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.919 
was able to come bring up a list and
jump<00:01:31.369> directly<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.179> material<00:01:32.689> that<00:01:32.869> I

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
jump directly to the material that I

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.870 
jump directly to the material that I
wanted<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.409> edit<00:01:34.419> let's<00:01:35.419> take<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.689> look<00:01:35.929> at<00:01:36.109> a<00:01:36.289> a

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
wanted to edit let's take a look at a a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:46.389 
wanted to edit let's take a look at a a
tan<00:01:38.049> chess<00:01:39.049> piece<00:01:39.349> here<00:01:42.609> now<00:01:44.950> we'll<00:01:45.950> see<00:01:46.130> here

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
tan chess piece here now we'll see here

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.649 
tan chess piece here now we'll see here
that<00:01:46.429> it's<00:01:46.700> got<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.239> lot<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.569> different

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
that it's got a lot of different

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.239 
that it's got a lot of different
parameters<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.679> glossy<00:01:49.130> material

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
parameters and it's a glossy material

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.190 
parameters and it's a glossy material
and<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:49.759> can<00:01:49.909> adjust<00:01:50.239> the<00:01:50.359> specularity<00:01:50.869> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
and we can adjust the specularity and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.769 
and we can adjust the specularity and
roughness<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.829> thin-film<00:01:52.630> interactions<00:01:53.630> and

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
roughness and thin-film interactions and

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.620 
roughness and thin-film interactions and
bumping<00:01:54.169> normal<00:01:54.560> maps<00:01:54.739> and<00:01:55.009> opacity<00:01:55.539> but<00:01:56.539> what

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
bumping normal maps and opacity but what

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.209 
bumping normal maps and opacity but what
I'd<00:01:56.719> like<00:01:56.749> to<00:01:56.929> look<00:01:57.139> at<00:01:57.319> is<00:01:57.469> right<00:01:57.649> now<00:01:57.799> is<00:01:58.009> it's

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
I'd like to look at is right now is it's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.019 
I'd like to look at is right now is it's
got<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.700> image<00:01:59.209> map<00:01:59.779> set<00:02:00.169> as<00:02:00.380> its<00:02:01.189> diffuse

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.029 
got a image map set as its diffuse

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:05.469 
got a image map set as its diffuse
Channel<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.950> anytime<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.759> we<00:02:04.999> want<00:02:05.209> to<00:02:05.270> use<00:02:05.329> a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
Channel so anytime that we want to use a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.210 
Channel so anytime that we want to use a
color<00:02:05.929> image<00:02:06.169> and<00:02:07.720> use<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:08.959> octane<00:02:09.410> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
color image and use it in octane that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.569 
color image and use it in octane that
should<00:02:10.489> be<00:02:10.610> set<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.060> an<00:02:11.330> image<00:02:11.719> type<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.680> we<00:02:13.459> are

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
should be set to an image type if we are

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.789 
should be set to an image type if we are
using<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:14.090> black<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.599> white<00:02:14.629> image<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.379> like<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
using a black and white image so like a

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.110 
using a black and white image so like a
bump<00:02:16.189> map

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
bump map

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.039 
bump map
we<00:02:17.360> want<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.750> turn<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.230> into<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.799> float<00:02:19.549> image

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
we want to turn that into a float image

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.869 
we want to turn that into a float image
that<00:02:21.049> will<00:02:21.230> save<00:02:21.530> video<00:02:21.890> card<00:02:22.220> ram<00:02:22.489> because<00:02:22.760> it

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
that will save video card ram because it

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.309 
that will save video card ram because it
will<00:02:23.030> take<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.480> only<00:02:23.810> load<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.170> as<00:02:24.290> a

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
will take and only load it as a

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.530 
will take and only load it as a
grayscale<00:02:25.099> image<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:26.030> that's<00:02:26.209> all<00:02:26.390> that's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
grayscale image and that's all that's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.170 
grayscale image and that's all that's
needed<00:02:26.750> for<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.110> bump<00:02:27.379> map<00:02:27.590> anyway<00:02:28.040> whereas<00:02:29.030> if

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
needed for a bump map anyway whereas if

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210 
needed for a bump map anyway whereas if
we<00:02:29.209> were<00:02:29.390> using<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.720> normal<00:02:29.959> map<00:02:30.379> we<00:02:30.830> would<00:02:31.040> want

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
we were using a normal map we would want

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.289 
we were using a normal map we would want
to<00:02:31.370> use<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.480> an<00:02:32.920> image<00:02:33.920> type<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.940> will<00:02:35.090> use

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
to use the an image type that will use

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.030 
to use the an image type that will use
the<00:02:35.480> full<00:02:35.690> colors<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:36.290> we'll<00:02:36.379> use<00:02:36.560> more<00:02:36.769> video

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
the full colors and we'll use more video

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.949 
the full colors and we'll use more video
card<00:02:37.310> ram<00:02:37.579> but<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:37.940> will<00:02:38.060> still<00:02:38.239> use<00:02:38.299> all<00:02:38.720> of

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
card ram but it will still use all of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.410 
card ram but it will still use all of
the<00:02:39.079> colors<00:02:39.409> if<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:40.400> wanted<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.760> change<00:02:41.150> this

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
the colors if we wanted to change this

change into other image files and load

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.280 
change into other image files and load
them<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.200> see<00:03:09.920> how<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.510> how<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.629> looks<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
them and see how the how it looks on the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.599 
them and see how the how it looks on the
model<00:03:13.870> which<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:14.989> also<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.290> scale<00:03:15.620> button<00:03:15.920> that

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
model which is also a scale button that

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.319 
model which is also a scale button that
will<00:03:16.640> allow<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.420> change<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> scaling<00:03:18.379> of

will allow you to change the scaling of

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.780 
will allow you to change the scaling of
the<00:03:20.329> texture<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.980> get<00:03:22.099> various<00:03:22.430> different

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the texture to get various different

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.080 
the texture to get various different
effects<00:03:23.060> bring<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.690> back<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.940> can

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
effects bring that back to one you can

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.909 
effects bring that back to one you can
also<00:03:26.269> change<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.849> gamma<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.500> texture

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
also change the the gamma of the texture

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.920 
also change the the gamma of the texture
itself<00:03:32.379> and<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:35.090> could<00:03:35.239> adjust<00:03:35.510> all<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> other

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
itself and we could adjust all the other

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.809 
itself and we could adjust all the other
parameters<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.680> see<00:03:36.919> what<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.370> material

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
parameters and see what the material

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.940 
parameters and see what the material
looks<00:03:38.299> like<00:03:38.480> we<00:03:39.139> could<00:03:39.290> change<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.919> a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
looks like we could change it to a

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.670 
looks like we could change it to a
diffuse<00:03:40.400> material<00:03:41.060> or<00:03:41.750> change<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.319> back<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.500> a

diffuse material or change it back to a
glossy<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:44.169> adjust<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:45.230> specularity<00:03:45.739> and

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
glossy and adjust the specularity and

glossy and adjust the specularity and
all<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> different<00:03:46.609> parameters<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.299> change

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
all the different parameters to change

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.740 
all the different parameters to change
its<00:03:47.810> appearance<00:03:48.910> now<00:03:49.910> if<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.239> wanted<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.599> work

specular material glassy material let me
get<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.109> little<00:04:03.230> background<00:04:03.680> behind<00:04:03.889> it<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:04.250> it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
get a little background behind it so it

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.920 
get a little background behind it so it
looks<00:04:04.459> kind<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.760> cool<00:04:07.629> one<00:04:08.629> of<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.780> neat

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
looks kind of cool one of the neat

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.530 
looks kind of cool one of the neat
things<00:04:08.959> about<00:04:09.410> working<00:04:10.239> interactively<00:04:11.239> is<00:04:11.389> we

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
things about working interactively is we

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.270 
things about working interactively is we
can<00:04:11.690> change<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.109> index<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.590> refraction<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
can change the index of refraction and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.860 
can change the index of refraction and
we<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.549> see<00:04:13.730> exactly<00:04:14.030> how<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.329> refraction

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
we can see exactly how the refraction

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.439 
we can see exactly how the refraction
changes<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:16.489> might<00:04:16.639> actually<00:04:16.849> find<00:04:17.269> an

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
changes so you might actually find an

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.509 
changes so you might actually find an
artistic<00:04:18.019> index<00:04:18.500> refraction<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:19.340> looks

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
artistic index refraction that looks

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.550 
artistic index refraction that looks
index<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.419> refraction<00:04:20.449> that<00:04:21.079> looks<00:04:21.229> better

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
index of refraction that looks better

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.540 
index of refraction that looks better
even<00:04:21.919> though<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.130> technically<00:04:22.460> not

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
even though it's technically not

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.490 
even though it's technically not
accurate<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.750> can<00:04:23.780> move<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.169> around<00:04:24.229> until

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
accurate you can move it around until

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.930 
accurate you can move it around until
you<00:04:24.740> find<00:04:24.770> something<00:04:25.190> visually<00:04:25.729> that's

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you find something visually that's

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.420 
you find something visually that's
pleasing<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:27.680> would<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.919> difficult<00:04:28.070> to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
pleasing and that would be difficult to

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.370 
pleasing and that would be difficult to
do<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.760> traditional<00:04:29.270> renderer<00:04:29.719> it<00:04:30.169> can<00:04:30.289> also

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
do in a traditional renderer it can also

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.060 
do in a traditional renderer it can also
change<00:04:30.740> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
change the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.860 
change the
color<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.400> glass<00:04:31.580> by<00:04:32.030> clicking<00:04:32.420> and<00:04:32.600> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
color of the glass by clicking and the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.710 
color of the glass by clicking and the
little<00:04:33.260> RGB<00:04:33.770> spectrum<00:04:34.010> box<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.760> we<00:04:35.330> could<00:04:35.510> set

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
little RGB spectrum box and we could set

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:44.800 
little RGB spectrum box and we could set
it<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.900> number<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.890> different<00:04:36.980> parameters<00:04:43.810> now

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
it a number of different parameters now

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.290 
it a number of different parameters now
I've<00:04:44.990> reset<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.650> chest<00:04:46.040> scene<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.580> i'm

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
I've reset this chest scene and i'm

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.610

going<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.540> show<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.720> an<00:04:47.900> example<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.410> how<00:04:48.470> to

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
going to show you an example of how to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.490 
going to show you an example of how to
create<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.040> material<00:04:49.630> using<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:51.020> node<00:04:51.260> editor

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
create a material using the node editor

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.830 
create a material using the node editor
and<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.760> do<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:52.970> I'm<00:04:53.210> going<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.390> work<00:04:53.690> on

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
and so to do that I'm going to work on

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
and so to do that I'm going to work on
this<00:04:53.960> red<00:04:54.200> piece<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.770> I'm<00:04:55.430> going<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.610> create<00:04:55.880> a

this red piece and I'm going to create a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.020 
this red piece and I'm going to create a
unrealistic<00:04:57.860> material<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.730> show<00:04:58.970> you

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
the example and the power of nodes so

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.580 
the example and the power of nodes so
down<00:05:01.820> in<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.390> graph<00:05:02.810> editor<00:05:03.020> i'm<00:05:03.320> going<00:05:03.530> to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
down in the graph editor i'm going to

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.770 
down in the graph editor i'm going to
right<00:05:03.800> click<00:05:03.830> and<00:05:04.670> i'm<00:05:04.790> going<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.060> add<00:05:05.240> three

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
right click and i'm going to add three

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.370 
right click and i'm going to add three
textures<00:05:06.170> i'm<00:05:06.470> going<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.740> add<00:05:06.860> an<00:05:07.010> RGB<00:05:07.340> texture

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
textures i'm going to add an RGB texture

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
textures i'm going to add an RGB texture
i'm<00:05:09.380> going<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.710> add<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.520> gaussian<00:05:11.510> spectrum<00:05:12.050> and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
i'm going to add a gaussian spectrum and

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.980 
i'm going to add a gaussian spectrum and
i'm<00:05:13.400> going<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.700> add<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:14.650> checks<00:05:16.720> texture<00:05:17.720> so

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
i'm going to add a checks texture so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.450 
i'm going to add a checks texture so
this<00:05:18.140> is<00:05:18.230> a<00:05:18.260> checkerboard<00:05:18.800> pattern<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.370> we're

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
this is a checkerboard pattern and we're

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.400 
this is a checkerboard pattern and we're
going<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.640> create<00:05:19.790> two<00:05:20.030> colors<00:05:20.420> now<00:05:21.200> I'm<00:05:21.290> going

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
going to create two colors now I'm going

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.780 
going to create two colors now I'm going
to<00:05:21.470> add<00:05:21.590> another<00:05:21.710> texture<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:22.490> going<00:05:22.730> to

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
to add another texture that's going to

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.780 
to add another texture that's going to
allow<00:05:22.850> me<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.330> mix<00:05:23.780> those<00:05:24.080> together<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.920> then

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
allow me to mix those together and then

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.790 
allow me to mix those together and then
I'm<00:05:25.970> going<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:26.240> make<00:05:26.420> a<00:05:26.450> material<00:05:26.720> which<00:05:27.380> is<00:05:27.410> on

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
I'm going to make a material which is on

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.620 
I'm going to make a material which is on
glossy<00:05:28.460> material<00:05:28.580> which<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.120> I'm<00:05:29.390> going<00:05:29.540> to

connect together all of these materials

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.240 
connect together all of these materials
now<00:05:32.330> what<00:05:32.480> just<00:05:32.660> happened<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.230> clicked<00:05:33.770> on<00:05:33.920> the

texture nodes when selected I'm going to

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.850 
texture nodes when selected I'm going to
enable<00:05:55.670> that<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.180> now<00:05:56.930> when<00:05:57.170> i<00:05:57.200> select<00:05:57.500> these

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
enable that and now when i select these

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.400 
enable that and now when i select these
nodes<00:05:58.250> i<00:05:58.520> can<00:05:58.760> see<00:05:59.000> each<00:05:59.210> individual<00:05:59.900> texture

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.300 
nodes i can see each individual texture
i'm<00:06:01.250> going<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.700> change<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:03.440> scale<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.130> size

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
i'm going to change the scale and size

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.990 
i'm going to change the scale and size
of<00:06:04.700> my<00:06:05.110> checkerboard<00:06:06.110> check<00:06:06.680> our<00:06:06.830> ball<00:06:07.000> i'm

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
of my checkerboard check our ball i'm

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.960 
of my checkerboard check our ball i'm
going<00:06:08.270> to<00:06:08.390> also<00:06:08.510> change<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.960> color<00:06:09.320> of<00:06:09.530> my<00:06:10.460> RGB

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
going to also change the color of my RGB

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.770 
going to also change the color of my RGB
spectrum<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.820> gaussian<00:06:14.270> spectrum<00:06:14.660> is<00:06:14.750> a

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
spectrum the gaussian spectrum is a

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.300 
spectrum the gaussian spectrum is a
great<00:06:15.020> way<00:06:15.170> to<00:06:15.230> adjust<00:06:15.380> color<00:06:15.860> it's

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
great way to adjust color it's

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.010 
great way to adjust color it's
controlled<00:06:16.760> by<00:06:16.880> a<00:06:16.910> Gaussian<00:06:17.390> distribution<00:06:17.630> of

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
controlled by a Gaussian distribution of

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.320 
controlled by a Gaussian distribution of
wavelengths<00:06:18.440> of<00:06:18.560> light<00:06:18.620> so<00:06:19.130> you<00:06:19.220> can<00:06:19.340> change

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
wavelengths of light so you can change

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.680 
wavelengths of light so you can change
the<00:06:20.540> width<00:06:20.750> of<00:06:21.020> how<00:06:21.530> wide<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:22.220> the<00:06:23.180> spectrum

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
the width of how wide the the spectrum

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.020 
the width of how wide the the spectrum
is<00:06:23.900> and<00:06:24.170> then<00:06:24.710> where<00:06:24.950> the<00:06:25.100> wavelength<00:06:25.580> is<00:06:25.820> and

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
is and then where the wavelength is and

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.000 
is and then where the wavelength is and
you<00:06:26.090> need<00:06:26.240> some<00:06:26.390> beautiful<00:06:26.840> colors<00:06:27.200> this<00:06:27.800> way

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
you need some beautiful colors this way

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.520 
you need some beautiful colors this way
and<00:06:28.390> then<00:06:29.390> we<00:06:29.510> have<00:06:29.660> this<00:06:29.810> mixed<00:06:30.200> texture

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
and then we have this mixed texture

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.740 
and then we have this mixed texture
which<00:06:30.680> is<00:06:30.830> three<00:06:31.130> different<00:06:31.610> inputs<00:06:32.030> I'm

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
which is three different inputs I'm

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.420 
which is three different inputs I'm
going<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.170> take<00:06:33.290> the<00:06:33.470> checks<00:06:33.770> texture<00:06:34.220> and<00:06:34.310> put

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
going to take the checks texture and put

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.310 
going to take the checks texture and put
it<00:06:34.520> to<00:06:34.610> the<00:06:34.640> amount<00:06:35.060> that's<00:06:35.390> going<00:06:35.660> to<00:06:35.720> control

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
it to the amount that's going to control

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.050 
it to the amount that's going to control
the<00:06:37.040> mixture<00:06:37.640> between<00:06:37.850> these<00:06:38.480> two<00:06:39.050> colors<00:06:39.290> and

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
the mixture between these two colors and

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.480 
the mixture between these two colors and
then<00:06:41.060> we've<00:06:41.240> got<00:06:41.270> a<00:06:41.720> mixture<00:06:42.320> between<00:06:42.590> those

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
then we've got a mixture between those

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.570 
then we've got a mixture between those
two<00:06:43.640> colors

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
two colors

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.909 
two colors
even<00:06:44.789> though<00:06:44.879> it's<00:06:44.970> ugly<00:06:45.210> and<00:06:45.530> then<00:06:46.530> we<00:06:46.800> have

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
even though it's ugly and then we have

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.010 
even though it's ugly and then we have
this<00:06:47.039> mixed<00:06:47.400> texture<00:06:47.789> I<00:06:47.970> want<00:06:48.539> to<00:06:48.629> connect<00:06:48.900> it

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
this mixed texture I want to connect it

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.390 
this mixed texture I want to connect it
to<00:06:49.139> this<00:06:49.229> glossy<00:06:49.650> material<00:06:49.770> the<00:06:50.189> first

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
to this glossy material the first

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.249 
to this glossy material the first
triangle<00:06:50.849> is<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.210> diffuse<00:06:51.629> channel<00:06:52.050> so<00:06:52.199> i'm

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
triangle is the diffuse channel so i'm

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.409 
triangle is the diffuse channel so i'm
going<00:06:52.439> to<00:06:52.500> click<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:52.919> there<00:06:53.129> now<00:06:53.939> we<00:06:54.000> click<00:06:54.270> on

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
going to click it there now we click on

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.029 
going to click it there now we click on
the<00:06:54.539> glossy<00:06:54.750> material<00:06:55.050> we<00:06:55.530> see<00:06:55.740> that<00:06:55.949> the

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
the glossy material we see that the

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.040 
the glossy material we see that the
glossy<00:06:56.280> material<00:06:56.550> is<00:06:56.969> indeed<00:06:57.240> glossy<00:06:57.840> and

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
glossy material is indeed glossy and

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.350 
glossy material is indeed glossy and
that<00:06:58.590> it's<00:06:58.860> color<00:06:59.250> is<00:06:59.370> controlled<00:07:00.090> by<00:07:00.180> this

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
that it's color is controlled by this

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.409 
that it's color is controlled by this
node<00:07:01.199> mixture<00:07:01.889> that<00:07:02.009> we<00:07:02.129> have<00:07:02.280> here<00:07:02.550> I<00:07:02.669> know

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
node mixture that we have here I know

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.749 
node mixture that we have here I know
that<00:07:03.810> the<00:07:03.930> fourth<00:07:04.229> triangle<00:07:04.919> over<00:07:05.189> is<00:07:05.340> the<00:07:05.370> red

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
that the fourth triangle over is the red

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.399 
that the fourth triangle over is the red
one<00:07:05.969> I'm<00:07:06.210> just<00:07:06.719> going<00:07:06.840> to<00:07:06.870> connect<00:07:07.229> those

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
one I'm just going to connect those

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:09.619 
one I'm just going to connect those
together<00:07:07.620> now<00:07:08.069> click<00:07:08.370> here<00:07:08.669> and<00:07:08.759> now<00:07:09.449> we<00:07:09.509> have

piece now in order to further adjust
these<00:07:14.909> nodes<00:07:15.300> I'm<00:07:15.599> going<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.050> turn<00:07:16.289> off<00:07:16.620> these

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 
these nodes I'm going to turn off these

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.930 
these nodes I'm going to turn off these
two<00:07:18.050> buttons<00:07:19.050> so<00:07:19.830> that<00:07:20.009> when<00:07:20.129> I<00:07:20.159> collect<00:07:20.639> them

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
two buttons so that when I collect them

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.330 
two buttons so that when I collect them
I<00:07:21.180> get<00:07:21.750> the<00:07:21.900> settings<00:07:22.289> /<00:07:22.560> on<00:07:22.740> in<00:07:22.979> the<00:07:23.099> node

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 
I get the settings / on in the node

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.040 
I get the settings / on in the node
inspector<00:07:23.940> but<00:07:24.120> yet<00:07:24.240> I<00:07:24.270> can<00:07:24.509> still<00:07:24.539> see<00:07:25.020> the

inspector but yet I can still see the
chest<00:07:25.469> scene<00:07:25.710> so<00:07:26.460> I<00:07:26.490> could<00:07:26.819> adjust<00:07:27.300> let's<00:07:27.599> say

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
chest scene so I could adjust let's say

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.689 
chest scene so I could adjust let's say
if<00:07:27.810> i<00:07:27.930> wanted<00:07:28.229> to<00:07:28.289> adjust<00:07:28.919> these<00:07:29.099> and<00:07:29.400> make<00:07:29.520> the

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699 
if i wanted to adjust these and make the

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.230 
if i wanted to adjust these and make the
checkerboard<00:07:30.210> pattern<00:07:30.599> much<00:07:31.590> bigger<00:07:32.060> in<00:07:33.060> fact

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 
checkerboard pattern much bigger in fact

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.899 
checkerboard pattern much bigger in fact
it's<00:07:33.479> a<00:07:33.509> little<00:07:33.750> difficult<00:07:33.930> to<00:07:34.289> see<00:07:34.729> since<00:07:35.729> the

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:35.909 
it's a little difficult to see since the

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:37.879 
it's a little difficult to see since the
material<00:07:36.060> so<00:07:36.539> glossy<00:07:36.870> so<00:07:37.349> i'm<00:07:37.409> going<00:07:37.560> to<00:07:37.650> turn

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:37.889 
material so glossy so i'm going to turn

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.119 
material so glossy so i'm going to turn
the<00:07:38.129> specularity<00:07:38.669> down<00:07:39.029> and<00:07:39.830> then<00:07:40.830> we<00:07:40.979> could

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:41.129 
the specularity down and then we could

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:43.670 
the specularity down and then we could
also<00:07:41.279> go<00:07:41.639> and<00:07:41.879> change<00:07:42.210> let's<00:07:42.779> say<00:07:43.020> the<00:07:43.289> colors

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 
also go and change let's say the colors

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.570 
also go and change let's say the colors
and<00:07:45.259> that's<00:07:46.259> how<00:07:46.409> you<00:07:46.469> could<00:07:46.800> procedurally

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 
and that's how you could procedurally

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.269 
and that's how you could procedurally
make<00:07:48.090> a<00:07:48.120> complex<00:07:48.690> material<00:07:49.289> that<00:07:49.710> takes<00:07:49.740> up<00:07:50.099> no

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:50.279 
make a complex material that takes up no

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.219 
make a complex material that takes up no
video<00:07:50.580> memory<00:07:50.879> if<00:07:51.599> you'd<00:07:51.810> like<00:07:51.870> to<00:07:51.990> see<00:07:52.199> a

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:52.229 
video memory if you'd like to see a

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:54.260 
video memory if you'd like to see a
great<00:07:52.469> example<00:07:52.770> this<00:07:53.039> again<00:07:53.400> open<00:07:53.849> up<00:07:54.000> the

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.270 
great example this again open up the

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.839 
great example this again open up the
chest<00:07:54.509> set<00:07:55.020> that's<00:07:55.259> labeled<00:07:55.860> procedural<00:07:56.669> and

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:56.849 
chest set that's labeled procedural and

00:07:56.849 --> 00:07:58.580 
chest set that's labeled procedural and
you'll<00:07:57.300> see<00:07:57.479> how<00:07:57.509> all<00:07:57.779> the<00:07:57.900> marbles<00:07:58.139> and<00:07:58.500> all

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:58.590 
you'll see how all the marbles and all

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.350 
you'll see how all the marbles and all
the<00:07:58.680> materials<00:07:59.159> were<00:07:59.310> created<00:07:59.789> we're<00:08:00.000> using

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 
the materials were created we're using

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.209 
the materials were created we're using
complex<00:08:00.960> nodes<00:08:01.349> and<00:08:01.560> that<00:08:01.680> would<00:08:01.800> be<00:08:01.830> a<00:08:01.949> great

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:02.219 
complex nodes and that would be a great

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:04.249 
complex nodes and that would be a great
way<00:08:02.250> to<00:08:02.430> study<00:08:02.819> to<00:08:03.539> see<00:08:03.750> how<00:08:03.779> you<00:08:03.930> can<00:08:04.110> make

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 
way to study to see how you can make

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:05.839 
way to study to see how you can make
some<00:08:04.469> complex<00:08:04.860> materials<00:08:05.490> but<00:08:05.610> I<00:08:05.669> hopefully

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:05.849 
some complex materials but I hopefully

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:07.550 
some complex materials but I hopefully
this<00:08:06.210> will<00:08:06.360> give<00:08:06.539> you<00:08:06.629> a<00:08:06.690> little<00:08:06.870> more<00:08:07.050> comfort

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 
this will give you a little more comfort

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.499 
this will give you a little more comfort
and<00:08:07.710> how<00:08:08.099> to<00:08:08.159> connect<00:08:08.580> together<00:08:08.699> a<00:08:08.969> material

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:09.509 
and how to connect together a material

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.059 
and how to connect together a material
and<00:08:09.599> explore<00:08:10.080> and<00:08:10.349> figure<00:08:10.500> out<00:08:10.620> how<00:08:10.800> you<00:08:10.860> can

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:11.069 
and explore and figure out how you can

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:15.620 
and explore and figure out how you can
do<00:08:11.190> very<00:08:11.400> complex<00:08:11.940> and<00:08:12.240> neat<00:08:12.870> materials
