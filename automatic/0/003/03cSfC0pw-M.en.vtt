00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.890 

alright<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:50.440> actually<00:02:51.570> debating<00:02:52.570> with<00:02:52.720> it

alright so I'm actually debating with it

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.060 
alright so I'm actually debating with it
whether<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.410> get<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:55.080> Zipit<00:02:56.080> coin<00:02:56.290> purse<00:02:56.590> but

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
whether to get the Zipit coin purse but

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.620 
whether to get the Zipit coin purse but
I<00:02:57.100> think<00:02:57.489> I'll<00:02:57.610> just<00:02:57.820> stick<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.239> this<00:02:58.390> one

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
I think I'll just stick to this one

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.539 
I think I'll just stick to this one
because<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.019> more<00:02:59.590> practical<00:03:00.540> and

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
because this is more practical and

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.289 
because this is more practical and
slimmer<00:03:03.549> than<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.739> zipa<00:03:05.739> coin<00:03:05.920> purse<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:07.150> who

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
slimmer than the zipa coin purse but who

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.780 
slimmer than the zipa coin purse but who
knows<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.959> know<00:03:08.110> might<00:03:08.290> decide<00:03:08.590> later<00:03:08.799> on<00:03:08.980> but
