00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.610
 our focus was to demonstrate the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.240
 procedure for uniform sanding 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.220
 avoid creating with donations on the glass and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 removing the larger risks 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.619
 noting that some materials may be 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.580
 with a little more rigid and some less 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.699
 making it difficult to 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.949
 our work 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.519
 unfortunately with the use of these lines 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:49.600
 discard this piece was not 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:52.449
 view and analyze all service using 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.269
 only the diamonds and at the end 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:00.369
 of our work we will have a surface 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.890
 flat and uniform without donations to 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:05.530
 then we can do the stage of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 final polishing using 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.180
 felt and cerium oxide or possibly 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.750
 some other type of trash like the three 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.020
 3m gear for final polishing 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 Throughout these videos, we 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.920
 identify risks where we need them 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.020
 involve grinding sanding steps to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.350
 surface in a correct way to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.310
 avoid corrugations difficulties in the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.090
 glass repair process 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.700
 as final considerations personal after 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.890
 Our Glass Repair Job 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.549
 in some areas to add the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.200
 first point the technique of movement 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.250
 should always be as uniform as possible 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.649
 second point the lubrication of water is 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.079
 fundamental in this process 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.470
 It's natural that in the beginning when people 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.950
 is starting this type of service this 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.709
 type of repair we encounter with 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.730
 not knowing the weight of 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:19.000
 junk to use and as you go 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.500
 running your tests you will notice that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 some risks 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.769
 You can quietly use sandpapers. 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.080
 thinner and in others up to here use 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.200
 thicker sanding 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.580
 this you will learn in the course of 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.920
 your services 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.590
 some people recommend that the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.130
 the final polishing process is done 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 dry or nearly dry it will be the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.489
 I would prefer to end the whole 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.170
 process as a lubrication with water 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.420
 constant and durability of lists 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.519
 of this model that I have used in 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.100
 videos here is great 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.370
 certainly greater than the three acts 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.620
 the host 3m glass hope 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.720
