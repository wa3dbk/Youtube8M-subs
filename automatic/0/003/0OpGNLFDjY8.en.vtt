it on it slides in very nicely almost so

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.640 
it on it slides in very nicely almost so
nicely<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.720> I<00:01:49.750> thought<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.470> was<00:01:50.560> going

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
nicely that I thought that it was going

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.170 
nicely that I thought that it was going
to<00:01:50.710> rattle<00:01:50.980> around<00:01:51.190> when<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.760> got<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.030> there

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
to rattle around when it got in there

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.210 
to rattle around when it got in there
but<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.450> did<00:01:52.630> not<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.380> slides<00:01:53.620> in<00:01:53.920> really

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
but it did not so it slides in really

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.340 
but it did not so it slides in really
nice<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.610> put<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.909> bottom<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:56.020> very

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
sure why they put that there whether

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.560 
sure why they put that there whether
it's<00:03:33.680> for<00:03:33.860> protection<00:03:34.070> or<00:03:34.760> maybe<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.390> has

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
it's for protection or maybe that has

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.970 
it's for protection or maybe that has
something<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.989> do<00:03:36.200> with<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.470> flash<00:03:36.739> not

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980

sleep/wake button hole hey so just the

sleep/wake button hole hey so just the
kind<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.750> an<00:05:53.870> FYI<00:05:54.230> I've<00:05:54.800> been<00:05:55.100> rocking<00:05:55.430> it<00:05:55.670> both

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
kind of an FYI I've been rocking it both

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.700 
kind of an FYI I've been rocking it both
ways<00:05:56.060> and<00:05:56.390> then<00:05:56.450> after<00:05:57.110> a<00:05:57.140> day<00:05:57.230> or<00:05:57.500> two<00:05:57.680> I

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
ways and then after a day or two I

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.350

noticed that that little nipple is

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.810 
noticed that that little nipple is
designed<00:06:00.170> to<00:06:00.560> catch<00:06:00.830> that<00:06:01.040> sleep-wake<00:06:01.580> hole

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
designed to catch that sleep-wake hole

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.870 
designed to catch that sleep-wake hole
so<00:06:02.300> it<00:06:02.960> gives<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.350> a<00:06:03.440> really<00:06:03.770> nice<00:06:04.100> secure<00:06:04.580> fit
