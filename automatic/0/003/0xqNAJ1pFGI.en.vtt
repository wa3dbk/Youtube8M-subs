00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
some of my artwork and thought that I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
some of my artwork and thought that I
would<00:01:24.270> need<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.530> she<00:01:25.710> held<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
would need to have it and so she held on

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300 
would need to have it and so she held on
to<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.680> wasn't<00:01:29.070> until

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to it and then I think it wasn't until

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.649 
to it and then I think it wasn't until
like<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.700> eight<00:01:29.880> months<00:01:30.180> later<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659

which is a sacred Inca symbol every
level<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> resembles<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.439> different

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
level kind of resembles a different

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.550 
level kind of resembles a different
state<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> underworld<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.049> Middle

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
state so like the underworld the Middle

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
state so like the underworld the Middle
Earth<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.979> sky<00:01:59.219> above<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> goes

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
Earth the sky above but then it goes

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630 
Earth the sky above but then it goes
several<00:02:00.930> different<00:02:01.170> ways<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> idea<00:02:02.549> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
several different ways but the idea is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.209 
several different ways but the idea is
that<00:02:02.759> each<00:02:03.240> Terrace<00:02:03.990> isn't<00:02:04.770> necessarily

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that each Terrace isn't necessarily

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
that each Terrace isn't necessarily
above<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.850> another<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.689> circles

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
above one another because it circles

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.730 
above one another because it circles
back<00:02:07.320> over

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
back over

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.279 
back over
I'm<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.700> best<00:02:08.910> health<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> think<00:02:10.140> I've

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
I'm in the best health that I think I've

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.020 
I'm in the best health that I think I've
ever<00:02:10.319> been<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.739> actually<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.520> stronger<00:02:12.000> now

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
ever been in actually I'm stronger now

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.100 
ever been in actually I'm stronger now
than<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.870> was<00:02:13.110> before<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.220> pregnant

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
than I was before I was pregnant

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.750 
than I was before I was pregnant
definitely<00:02:16.110> feel<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.280> sexiest<00:02:17.849> now
