00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do it 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.389
 hello i am rijn and in this review 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.889
 we look at a very beautiful vacuum cleaner 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.070
 for people with allergies 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.209
 it is the miele s8 optic lean and that 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.920
 we do of course from it 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.920
 inspirience center of miele 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.170
 if we take the miele s8 on deeply to the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.910
 we first see packaging 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.990
 Of course this beautiful vacuuming which 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.860
 very suitable for people with a 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.869
 allergy 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.910
 then we have a vacuum cleaner hose here 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.129
 we have a three-part telescope tube 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.440
 And in addition, we already have ergotec 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.820
 mouthpiece and that is a mouthpiece what see 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.350
 you are suitable for those with a 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.949
 allergy because it gives with a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.899
 indicator that green orange or red 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.309
 indicator gives or gives an indication 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.780
 he explained exactly how clean it is 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.429
 surface is what you are sucking 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.530
 and we are also one 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.679
 special mouthpiece to clean mattresses 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.679
 suck 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.710
 what makes the mouthpiece of this optic 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.359
 well so interesting 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.489
 there's an indicator here to get you on it 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.499
 the moment you enter he gives one here 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.059
 color and that color that gives exactly 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.880
 how clean the surface is you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.979
 is going to suck the green is 99.9 percent 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.869
 the dirt has disappeared which is red 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.310
 it heavily contaminated and during it 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.500
 suck you will then see the color 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.719
 change to your desired color 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.890
 which I assume is green 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.079
 otherwise this is of course just one 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.149
 combi mouthpiece with a special 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.439
 possibility to package and hard floors 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.390
 to suck 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.649
 then of course we have the s8 on it 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.780
 that clean itself 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.409

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.789
 people who are very sensitive to dust 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.200
 or dust particles 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.329
 make you see here in a moment 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.740
 all in here is a button here 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.649
 at the top if I do that 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.119

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.829

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.600
 naturally the air goes out 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.649
 and here it is indicated with which 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.729
 suction work again and we can 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.020
 very easy to adjust with the foot 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.149
 by entering a plus and minus 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.770
 and then we choose here 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.289
 the substrate where we are sucking 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.789
 are this button there we draw the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.710
 plug and cord inside 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.900
 and you will see it with Miele throughout 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.940

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780
 checked 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.030

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.209
 off here and there here is your on and on 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.159
 button and what I find very useful 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.110
 offer to these miele vacuum cleaners 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.870
 is that here the parking position shit but 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.360
 that there is also a parking position at the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.860
 side and as here they are capable 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 with the brush 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.940
 it could predatory dinosaurs more time 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.160
 on the other hand, and yes, I think so 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.330
 just a very smart solutions smart 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.440
 innovation 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.849
 Look here for a while to the bottom 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.410
 naturally have 3 casters that 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.959
 ensure that they are behind you without any problems 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.000
 led to it and then here we come to it 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.250
 interior work is extraordinary 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.709
 important in mill is all these s8 anyway 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 look very good to you anyway 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.859
 when it comes to blowing out skies 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.629
 looks no cracks in the vacuum 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.220
 through which the air goes out to 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.440
 it is very important for allergy 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.049
 who is also a real one 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.989
 active hepa filter and that takes care of it 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.269
 sure 99.99 percent of all 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.290
 dust particles that may still be in the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.549
 exhausted air 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.870
 to disappear 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.790
 and then we have a filter here 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.739
 that nature ensures that also the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.090
 engine remains clean 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.480
 they then have a 4 and a half liters 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.560
 large vacuum sinks through wall momentarily 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.819
 close 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.430
 let's have a look here and see 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.840
 here are three more accessories 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.840
 furniture mouthpiece you a deer that egmond 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.329
 piece very suitable yes bevoorbeeld 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.160
 and the piano keys to clean and 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.870
 I have here a crevice tje 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.489
 well that is does not last 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.769
 unimportant and then you will recover 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.269
 those places where you are not with the big ones 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.639
 brush can come with the miele s8 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.790
 optics lean really turns everything around 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.470
 beauty to clarity to hygiene and 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.540
 that of course has everything to do with 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.489
 the implementation of this vacuum cleaner 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.109
 And yes that is simply made for 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.389
 people who are just allergic to it 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.980
 dirty and whether you really are or you 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.480
 it's just to lash 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 but you just want your house all the way 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.690
 have clean 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.419
 well and there is this vacuum cleaner close 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.739
 ideally suited for natural sitting 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.629
 here again such an adjustable 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.910
 telescope tube but there is a whole 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.380
 special mouthpiece and that mouthpiece 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.579
 I want to show you 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.750
 because at the moment we now have the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.750
 turn on the vacuum cleaner 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.990
 then you'll see 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.730
 that a light comes on below 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.320
 I'll turn it off for a while because then you can do it 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.280
 to see another light is that 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.220
 light green 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.419
 then your floor is completely spiked and span 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.940
 the light orange 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.230
 then you have some work to do is it 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.060
 light red 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.500
 Well then you really have to be firm 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.780
 get started but then you have at least 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.190
