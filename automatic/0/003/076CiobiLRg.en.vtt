00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.369 
mean I would dip I would dip into it
yeah<00:04:08.699> I<00:04:08.940> picked<00:04:09.569> this<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.980> one<00:04:11.280> and

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
yeah I picked this one this one and

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.180 
yeah I picked this one this one and
tighten<00:04:13.379> star<00:04:13.799> fat<00:04:14.069> fall<00:04:14.419> very<00:04:15.419> good<00:04:15.599> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
tighten star fat fall very good and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.589 
tighten star fat fall very good and
obviously<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.640> only<00:04:17.849> reason<00:04:18.269> we<00:04:18.419> won't

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
obviously the only reason we won't

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.990 
obviously the only reason we won't
really<00:04:18.780> want<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.079> do<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.370> we<00:04:20.459> can<00:04:20.489> get

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
really want to do this is so we can get

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.460 
really want to do this is so we can get
NX<00:04:21.419> sameed<00:04:21.870> what

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
NX sameed what

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.910 
NX sameed what
23<00:04:22.950> different<00:04:23.100> cards<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:24.050> 17<00:04:25.050> manners<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:25.740> we

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
23 different cards and 17 manners so we

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.100 
23 different cards and 17 manners so we
are<00:04:26.040> an<00:04:26.190> aggro<00:04:26.520> deck<00:04:26.730> so<00:04:26.940> we<00:04:26.970> won't<00:04:27.330> pay<00:04:27.570> we

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
are an aggro deck so we won't pay we

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.660 
are an aggro deck so we won't pay we
won't<00:04:28.290> play<00:04:28.500> actually<00:04:28.860> what<00:04:29.010> not<00:04:29.430> we<00:04:29.640> need

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
won't play actually what not we need

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.670 
won't play actually what not we need
another<00:04:29.880> card<00:04:30.300> which<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.990> perfect<00:04:31.380> because<00:04:31.410> i

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
another card which is perfect because i

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.400 
another card which is perfect because i
can<00:04:31.860> pick<00:04:32.240> since<00:04:33.240> one<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.480> them<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:34.140> man

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
can pick since one of them is a man

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.930 
can pick since one of them is a man
after<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.770> i<00:04:34.920> can<00:04:35.130> pick<00:04:35.430> heightened

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
after that i can pick heightened

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.880 
after that i can pick heightened
strength<00:04:36.320> heightened<00:04:37.320> strength<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.710> to

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
strength heightened strength is to

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.750 
strength heightened strength is to
complete<00:04:38.460> blowout<00:04:38.820> in<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.270> heroic<00:04:39.870> decks

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
complete blowout in the heroic decks

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.120 
complete blowout in the heroic decks
essentially<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:43.110> does<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:43.950> much

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
essentially it it just does so much

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.370 
essentially it it just does so much
damage<00:04:44.430> depending<00:04:44.910> on<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.900> know<00:04:45.930> flying

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
damage depending on you know flying

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.930 
damage depending on you know flying
lifelink<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.280> then<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.550> tighten<00:04:47.790> your

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
lifelink and then you tighten your

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.450 
lifelink and then you tighten your
strength<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.480> one<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:49.380> becomes<00:04:49.860> 6<00:04:50.280> damage

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
strength this one it becomes 6 damage

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.070 
strength this one it becomes 6 damage
and<00:04:50.940> then<00:04:51.930> likely<00:04:52.190> just<00:04:53.190> fantastic<00:04:54.080> obviously

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
and then likely just fantastic obviously

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.520 
and then likely just fantastic obviously
white<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.310> very<00:04:57.270> very<00:04:57.510> that's<00:04:57.900> where<00:04:58.110> most<00:04:58.380> of

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
white is very very that's where most of

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.190 
white is very very that's where most of
all<00:04:58.680> bombs<00:04:58.860> are<00:04:59.130> going<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.340> be<00:04:59.780> blue<00:05:00.780> which<00:05:01.050> can

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
all bombs are going to be blue which can

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.080 
all bombs are going to be blue which can
trigger<00:05:01.350> heroic<00:05:01.890> pretty<00:05:02.130> easily<00:05:02.340> in<00:05:02.610> blue<00:05:02.820> and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
trigger heroic pretty easily in blue and

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.230 
trigger heroic pretty easily in blue and
