bring this table up now what I'd like to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.650 
bring this table up now what I'd like to
do<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.830> install<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.040> series<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> fiddles<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
do is install a series of fiddles on the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
top of this table a fiddle is sort of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
top of this table a fiddle is sort of
like<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> backsplash<00:01:22.250> there's<00:01:23.250> something

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like a backsplash there's something

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.860 
like a backsplash there's something
that's<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:24.000> prevent<00:01:24.240> items<00:01:24.720> for

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
that's going to prevent items for

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.850 
that's going to prevent items for
getting<00:01:25.080> pushed<00:01:25.380> off<00:01:25.730> so<00:01:27.470> we're<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> use

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
getting pushed off so we're going to use

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
getting pushed off so we're going to use
this<00:01:29.010> material<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.790> called<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.360> sack<00:01:30.720> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this material that's called a sack it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.190 
this material that's called a sack it's
a<00:01:31.260> building<00:01:32.160> material<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.150> we're<00:01:34.050> going<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a building material and we're going to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.220 
a building material and we're going to
cut<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.620> down<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> certain<00:01:35.940> size<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
cut it down to a certain size so that

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.330 
cut it down to a certain size so that
essentially<00:01:37.980> creates<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.430> backsplash<00:01:39.000> here

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
essentially creates a backsplash here

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.390 
essentially creates a backsplash here
here<00:01:41.870> here<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.050> here

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
here here and here

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.520 
here here and here
and<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.300> leave<00:01:45.450> gaps<00:01:45.900> in<00:01:46.320> these

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and I want to leave gaps in these

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.220 
and I want to leave gaps in these
corners<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.460> when<00:01:47.580> we<00:01:47.730> go<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.880> wash<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.960> bait

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
corners so when we go to wash the bait

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.480 
corners so when we go to wash the bait
residue<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> evacuate<00:01:51.750> now

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
residue off as a way to evacuate now

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.110 
residue off as a way to evacuate now
this<00:01:53.490> size<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:55.020> big<00:01:55.230> for<00:01:55.260> our<00:01:55.530> purposes<00:01:56.120> so

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
this size is too big for our purposes so

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.719 
this size is too big for our purposes so

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
good now the next step is we want to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.250 
good now the next step is we want to
prominently<00:03:14.430> fasten<00:03:15.030> these<00:03:15.209> pedals<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:16.139> the

prominently fasten these pedals to the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.979 
prominently fasten these pedals to the
tabletop<00:03:16.939> so<00:03:17.939> we'll<00:03:18.209> go<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.659> drill<00:03:18.959> press

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
tabletop so we'll go to the drill press

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.660 
tabletop so we'll go to the drill press
next<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:20.010> don't<00:03:20.189> have<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> drill<00:03:20.639> press

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
next if you don't have a drill press

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.360 
next if you don't have a drill press
right<00:03:21.209> over<00:03:21.329> hand<00:03:21.510> roll<00:03:21.750> who<00:03:21.870> are<00:03:22.079> have<00:03:23.010> skip

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
right over hand roll who are have skip

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.360 
right over hand roll who are have skip
pre-drill<00:03:24.329> some<00:03:24.359> holes<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:26.010> we'll<00:03:26.159> get

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
pre-drill some holes and then we'll get

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:36.030 
pre-drill some holes and then we'll get
to<00:03:26.549> screwing<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.060> down<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.599> table<00:03:27.840> table

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.940

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
you know let's skip okay now that we've

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.520 
you know let's skip okay now that we've
got<00:04:24.940> our<00:04:25.090> fiddles<00:04:25.479> installed<00:04:25.930> what<00:04:26.199> I<00:04:26.229> want<00:04:26.470> to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
got our fiddles installed what I want to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.240 
got our fiddles installed what I want to
do<00:04:26.650> next<00:04:26.889> is<00:04:27.160> install<00:04:27.900> two<00:04:28.900> flat<00:04:29.590> plates<00:04:29.860> on

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.580 
I'm thinking we'll put one here and one
here<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.340> they'll<00:04:36.520> both<00:04:36.669> be<00:04:36.729> about<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.840> long

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
then skit is going to route grooves in

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.550 
then skit is going to route grooves in
this<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.180> purpose<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.690> this<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.169> put

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
this and the purpose of this is to put

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.490 
this and the purpose of this is to put
small<00:04:50.949> tools<00:04:51.250> on<00:04:51.580> or<00:04:52.270> egg<00:04:52.630> sinkers<00:04:53.169> which<00:04:53.380> we

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
small tools on or egg sinkers which we

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500 
small tools on or egg sinkers which we
use<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.860> rigging<00:04:54.070> baits<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.030> I'll<00:04:55.150> prevent
