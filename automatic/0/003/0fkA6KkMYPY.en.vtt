00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
tricky than I thought that would be

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
tricky than I thought that would be

I have no clue where Trump but it looks

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
I have no clue where Trump but it looks
just<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.350> bunny<00:00:58.680> except<00:00:59.219> he<00:00:59.370> has<00:00:59.489> eyebrows

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

just like bunny except he has eyebrows
and<00:01:00.449> Benny<00:01:00.750> dozen<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.340> least<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and Benny dozen or at least not on the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.990

mini<00:01:03.390> figure<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.250> just<00:01:05.250> noticed<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.729> mini

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
mini figure I just noticed this mini

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.649 
mini figure I just noticed this mini
figure<00:01:06.299> has<00:01:06.479> its<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> i<00:01:08.610> guess<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.299> you've

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
figure has its here so i guess if you've

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
figure has its here so i guess if you've
seen<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> movie<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> you've<00:01:11.340> seen<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.880> bunny

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
seen the movie and you've seen one bunny

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
seen the movie and you've seen one bunny
he's<00:01:13.220> upset<00:01:14.220> maybe<00:01:15.020> maybe<00:01:16.020> maybe<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.740> could

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
he's upset maybe maybe maybe that could

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
he's upset maybe maybe maybe that could
work<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> blue<00:01:18.509> piece<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
work what and then the blue piece in the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.130 
work what and then the blue piece in the
back<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.650> isn't<00:01:20.610> too<00:01:21.270> hard<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> find<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.960> long

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
back here isn't too hard to find as long

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.850 
back here isn't too hard to find as long
as<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.830> older<00:01:23.189> lego<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.680> it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
as you have some older lego and so it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.560 
as you have some older lego and so it's
basically<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> blue<00:01:26.939> monochrome

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
basically like a blue monochrome

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.890 
basically like a blue monochrome
minifigure<00:01:28.049> he's<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> pretty<00:01:29.600> big<00:01:30.600> smile

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
minifigure he's got a pretty big smile

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.850 
minifigure he's got a pretty big smile
so<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.920> pretty<00:01:32.040> cool<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.650> he

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so it's pretty cool and i think he

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.490 
so it's pretty cool and i think he
turned<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.280> pretty<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.570> only<00:01:36.960> thing<00:01:37.259> i

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
turned out pretty well the only thing i

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.550 
turned out pretty well the only thing i
would<00:01:37.619> say<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.869> why<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> can't<00:01:40.200> tell<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
would say is that why you can't tell it
