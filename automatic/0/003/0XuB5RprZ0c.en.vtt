that first comes in contact with holes
on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> drum<00:01:41.010> then<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.330> drum<00:01:42.600> spins

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
on the drum then as the drum spins

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.990 
on the drum then as the drum spins
another<00:01:43.680> part<00:01:43.980> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.160> skin<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.550> peeled<00:01:44.790> off

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
potato for use Sasaki was originally

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
potato for use Sasaki was originally
involved<00:01:57.870> in<00:01:58.170> development<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.920> machine

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
involved in development of a machine

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.180 
involved in development of a machine
that<00:01:59.730> screen<00:02:00.060> potatoes<00:02:00.600> by<00:02:00.810> size<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
that screen potatoes by size but it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.920 
that screen potatoes by size but it
resulted<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.790> small<00:02:03.180> potatoes<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:03.870> are

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
resulted in small potatoes that are

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
resulted in small potatoes that are
still<00:02:04.350> good<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.830> eat<00:02:05.040> being<00:02:05.400> screen<00:02:05.730> out<00:02:05.970> as

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
still good to eat being screen out as

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:18.830 
still good to eat being screen out as
non<00:02:06.750> saleable<00:02:07.380> product<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.920> disposal<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.600> was

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
non saleable product for disposal it was

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.320 
non saleable product for disposal it was
my<00:02:19.020> job<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:20.010> at<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> same<00:02:20.550> time<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.150> was

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
my job but at the same time it was

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.000 
my job but at the same time it was
creating<00:02:21.810> products<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.410> would<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.590> thrown

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
creating products that would be thrown

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.510 
creating products that would be thrown
out<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.810> asked<00:02:24.810> myself<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.980> was<00:02:26.100> some<00:02:26.340> way

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
out I asked myself if there was some way

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.810 
out I asked myself if there was some way
to<00:02:26.550> add<00:02:26.820> value<00:02:26.850> here<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:29.250> could<00:02:29.459> generate

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
to add value here if this could generate

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.180 
to add value here if this could generate
income<00:02:30.480> somehow<00:02:33.230> Sasaki<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:34.470> came<00:02:34.800> up<00:02:34.830> with

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
income somehow Sasaki then came up with

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.150 
income somehow Sasaki then came up with
the<00:02:35.340> idea<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> selling<00:02:36.330> pre<00:02:36.570> peeled<00:02:36.930> potatoes

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the idea of selling pre peeled potatoes

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.550 
the idea of selling pre peeled potatoes
first<00:02:39.820> he<00:02:40.210> made<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> machine<00:02:40.660> with<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> drummer

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
first he made a machine with a drummer

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.190 
first he made a machine with a drummer
with<00:02:41.710> small<00:02:42.220> holes<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.970> blade<00:02:43.210> but<00:02:43.840> he<00:02:43.960> soon

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
with small holes and a blade but he soon

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.620 
with small holes and a blade but he soon
ran<00:02:44.470> into<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> problem<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.730> blaze<00:02:46.000> wore<00:02:46.390> out

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
ran into a problem the blaze wore out

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.700 
ran into a problem the blaze wore out
too<00:02:47.020> quickly<00:02:50.670> Joe<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.600> thought<00:02:52.930> take<00:02:53.470> away

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
too quickly Joe then I thought take away

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.310 
too quickly Joe then I thought take away
the<00:02:53.890> blades<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:55.330> then<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.540> had<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> hard<00:02:56.110> time

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
the blades but then I had a hard time

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.560 
the blades but then I had a hard time
figuring<00:02:56.620> out<00:02:56.980> how<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.460> peel<00:02:57.910> without<00:02:58.240> using

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
figuring out how to peel without using

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.300 
figuring out how to peel without using
blades<00:03:00.750> there's<00:03:01.750> no<00:03:01.960> formula<00:03:02.860> for<00:03:03.220> these

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
blades there's no formula for these

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.300 
blades there's no formula for these
kinds<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.880> machines<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.500> just<00:03:05.770> have<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.070> try

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
kinds of machines you just have to try
