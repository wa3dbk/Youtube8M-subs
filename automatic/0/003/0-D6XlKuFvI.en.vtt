you have to pull them up these are
pretty<00:02:02.570> thin<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.140> these<00:02:03.289> will<00:02:03.500> stretch<00:02:03.920> fairly

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
pretty thin so these will stretch fairly

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.210

a bunch of times try and get these long

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.280 
a bunch of times try and get these long
as<00:02:10.099> close<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.700> can

nothing pulls it to one side of the
other<00:02:28.000> with<00:02:28.299> these<00:02:28.480> thin<00:02:29.170> sides<00:02:29.530> they<00:02:29.859> tend<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
other with these thin sides they tend to

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.940 
other with these thin sides they tend to
do<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.549> sometimes<00:02:31.469> trying<00:02:32.469> to<00:02:32.590> lay<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.739> all

down<00:02:32.980> at<00:02:33.430> once<00:02:35.879> just<00:02:36.879> like<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:40.709> just<00:02:41.709> give<00:02:41.950> it

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
down at once just like that just give it

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.690 
down at once just like that just give it
some<00:02:42.099> firm<00:02:42.640> pressure<00:02:42.879> on<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.239> edges<00:02:43.780> out<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
some firm pressure on the edges out the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.990 
some firm pressure on the edges out the
back<00:02:46.409> back<00:02:47.409> is<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:47.950> as<00:02:48.219> difficult<00:02:48.250> as<00:02:48.849> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
back back is not as difficult as the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.210
