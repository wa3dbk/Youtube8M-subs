my previous video where I did some
testing<00:01:49.900> in<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.350> virtual<00:01:50.500> lobby<00:01:50.890> with<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
testing in the virtual lobby with the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.040 
testing in the virtual lobby with the
submachine<00:01:51.760> guns<00:01:52.120> you<00:01:52.240> can<00:01:52.270> see<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:52.720> was<00:01:52.870> a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
submachine guns you can see it was a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.070 
submachine guns you can see it was a
five<00:01:53.380> hit<00:01:53.710> kill<00:01:54.040> at<00:01:54.280> close<00:01:55.000> range<00:01:55.420> now<00:01:56.050> I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
five hit kill at close range now I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.530 
five hit kill at close range now I
actually<00:01:56.440> think<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.310> legitimately<00:01:57.760> think<00:01:58.300> that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
actually think I legitimately think that

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.300 
actually think I legitimately think that
this<00:01:58.690> was<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.080> bug<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.680> was<00:01:59.860> something<00:02:00.130> that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
this was a bug this was something that

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.370 
this was a bug this was something that
they've<00:02:00.729> got<00:02:01.060> wrong<00:02:01.330> why<00:02:01.930> do<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.080> think<00:02:02.200> that

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
they've got wrong why do I think that

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.719 
they've got wrong why do I think that
why<00:02:02.650> do<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.800> not<00:02:02.979> think<00:02:03.159> they<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.520> got<00:02:03.640> the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
why do I not think they just got the

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.790 
why do I not think they just got the
balance<00:02:03.880> wrong<00:02:04.210> because<00:02:05.140> if<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.470> look<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.710> the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
balance wrong because if you look at the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.119 
balance wrong because if you look at the
official<00:02:06.280> advanced<00:02:07.000> warfare<00:02:07.170> gay<00:02:08.170> game<00:02:08.860> guide

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
official advanced warfare gay game guide

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.850 
official advanced warfare gay game guide
made<00:02:09.429> by<00:02:09.610> bradygames<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.569> says<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.379> ASM

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
made by bradygames it says that the ASM

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.100 
made by bradygames it says that the ASM
one<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.370> three<00:02:12.909> hit<00:02:13.120> kill<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.480> close-range

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
one is a three hit kill a close-range

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.070 
one is a three hit kill a close-range
why<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> official<00:02:15.610> guide<00:02:16.180> say<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.930> was

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
why would the official guide say it was

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.350 
why would the official guide say it was
a<00:02:17.110> three<00:02:17.409> hit<00:02:17.620> kill<00:02:17.860> range<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.849> then<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> not

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
a three hit kill range and then it not

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.180 
a three hit kill range and then it not
be<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:19.780> game<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.770> think<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.040> they

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
be in the game I just think that they

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.650 
be in the game I just think that they
messed<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.550> up<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.819> think<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.150> messed<00:02:22.300> up<00:02:22.450> all

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
messed it up I think they messed up all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.480 
messed it up I think they messed up all
the<00:02:22.870> balance<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> lot<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.130> weapons

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
the balance we have a lot of the weapons

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.400 
the balance we have a lot of the weapons
and<00:02:24.610> now<00:02:25.090> they're<00:02:25.300> fixing<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.050> any

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
and now they're fixing it so any

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.200 
and now they're fixing it so any
I<00:02:26.440> i<00:02:26.830> guess<00:02:27.430> i<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:27.550> put<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:27.940> out<00:02:28.000> there<00:02:28.060> and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
I i guess i just put it out there and

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.850 
I i guess i just put it out there and
thought<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.420> know<00:02:28.540> i'm<00:02:28.840> sure<00:02:29.140> people<00:02:29.320> notice

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
thought you know i'm sure people notice

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.070 
thought you know i'm sure people notice
if<00:02:30.100> it's<00:02:30.280> kind<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.550> broken<00:02:30.760> but<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.480> ESM<00:02:31.930> one

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
if it's kind of broken but the ESM one

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.900 
if it's kind of broken but the ESM one
is<00:02:32.260> now<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> three-hit<00:02:33.070> keel<00:02:33.280> over<00:02:33.430> range<00:02:33.730> it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
is now a three-hit keel over range it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.010 
is now a three-hit keel over range it
does<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.240> quite<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.480> slow<00:02:34.720> fire<00:02:34.960> rate

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
does have quite a slow fire rate

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.230 
does have quite a slow fire rate
compared<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> some<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.190> other<00:02:36.370> SMGs<00:02:36.880> but

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
compared to some of the other SMGs but

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.420 
compared to some of the other SMGs but
it<00:02:37.360> does<00:02:37.570> have<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.170> largest<00:02:38.530> magazine<00:02:39.250> as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
it does have the largest magazine as

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.610 
it does have the largest magazine as
well<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.940> very<00:02:40.300> reminiscent<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
well it's very reminiscent now of the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.400 
well it's very reminiscent now of the
PDW<00:02:42.460> from<00:02:42.700> black<00:02:42.880> ops<00:02:43.060> 2<00:02:43.330> which<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.870> course<00:02:43.900> was

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
PDW from black ops 2 which of course was

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.440 
PDW from black ops 2 which of course was
an<00:02:44.560> extremely<00:02:45.130> strong<00:02:45.340> weapon<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.910> lot<00:02:46.360> of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
an extremely strong weapon a lot of

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.270 
an extremely strong weapon a lot of
people<00:02:46.600> enjoyed<00:02:46.960> using<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.560> I've<00:02:47.800> gotta<00:02:48.040> do

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
people enjoyed using so I've gotta do

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.310 
people enjoyed using so I've gotta do
the<00:02:48.490> royalty<00:02:48.940> SMGs<00:02:49.480> next<00:02:49.840> after<00:02:50.080> I've<00:02:50.170> done

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
the royalty SMGs next after I've done

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.170 
the royalty SMGs next after I've done
the<00:02:50.440> assault<00:02:50.710> rifles<00:02:51.070> I've<00:02:51.220> nearly<00:02:51.700> done<00:02:51.970> them

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the assault rifles I've nearly done them

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.700 
the assault rifles I've nearly done them
I'm<00:02:52.450> gonna<00:02:52.600> be<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.200> through<00:02:53.500> all<00:02:53.680> of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
I'm gonna be going and through all of

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.960 
I'm gonna be going and through all of
them<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.010> I'm<00:02:54.160> looking<00:02:54.400> forward<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.760> using

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
them and I'm looking forward to using

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.880 
them and I'm looking forward to using
them<00:02:55.270> looks<00:02:55.450> at<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> ASM<00:02:56.080> one<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.410> now<00:02:56.740> an

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
them looks at the ASM one is now an

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.530 
them looks at the ASM one is now an
absolute<00:02:57.460> Boise<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.180> expect<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
absolute Boise then you can expect to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.930 
absolute Boise then you can expect to
see<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.320> lot<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.530> lobbies<00:02:59.920> now<00:03:00.130> plus<00:03:00.760> with

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
see in a lot of lobbies now plus with

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.250 
see in a lot of lobbies now plus with
the<00:03:00.970> k5<00:03:01.480> as<00:03:01.630> well<00:03:01.780> doesn't<00:03:01.990> know<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.140> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
the k5 as well doesn't know that the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.290 
the k5 as well doesn't know that the
care<00:03:02.470> fives<00:03:02.740> had<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.220> big<00:03:03.430> change<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:04.030> still<00:03:04.240> a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
care fives had a big change it's still a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.580 
care fives had a big change it's still a
three-hit<00:03:04.660> queue<00:03:04.840> up<00:03:04.930> close<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.470> was

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
three-hit queue up close like it was

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.290 
three-hit queue up close like it was
before<00:03:05.740> but<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:06.610> people<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.030> didn't

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
before but I think people just didn't

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.360 
before but I think people just didn't
really<00:03:07.390> realize<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.900> weren't<00:03:08.680> using<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
really realize that weren't using it and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.700 
really realize that weren't using it and
now<00:03:10.240> I<00:03:10.270> think<00:03:10.660> people<00:03:11.020> are<00:03:11.110> looking<00:03:11.380> back<00:03:11.530> in

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
now I think people are looking back in

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.200 
now I think people are looking back in
CS<00:03:11.920> mgs<00:03:12.250> again<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.490> think<00:03:12.550> people<00:03:12.790> will<00:03:12.940> notice

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
CS mgs again I think people will notice

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.270 
CS mgs again I think people will notice
that<00:03:13.240> so<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.780> think<00:03:14.140> you'll<00:03:14.290> see<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.500> lot<00:03:14.620> more<00:03:14.680> k5

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
that so I think you'll see a lot more k5
