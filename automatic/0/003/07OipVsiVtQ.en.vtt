right here which is going offer a little

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.740 
right here which is going offer a little
more<00:01:04.250> protection<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.089> knee<00:01:05.239> joint<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.689> the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
more protection to the knee joint on the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.800 
more protection to the knee joint on the
outside<00:01:06.619> as<00:01:07.429> far<00:01:07.640> as<00:01:07.759> up<00:01:07.969> in<00:01:08.149> this<00:01:08.299> region<00:01:08.689> this

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
outside as far as up in this region this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.499 
outside as far as up in this region this
is<00:01:08.869> dual<00:01:09.170> density<00:01:09.380> foams<00:01:09.829> on<00:01:10.159> both<00:01:10.700> sides<00:01:10.999> so

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
is dual density foams on both sides so

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.370 
is dual density foams on both sides so
let's<00:01:11.539> go<00:01:11.719> offer<00:01:11.929> a<00:01:11.960> little<00:01:12.140> more<00:01:12.229> protection

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
let's go offer a little more protection

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.529 
let's go offer a little more protection
to<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.069> outer<00:01:13.249> portions<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.119> leg<00:01:14.329> and

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
to the outer portions of the leg and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.389 
to the outer portions of the leg and
then<00:01:15.140> as<00:01:15.259> we<00:01:15.409> go<00:01:15.530> ahead<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:15.920> look<00:01:16.159> at<00:01:16.280> the

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
then as we go ahead and look at the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.370 
then as we go ahead and look at the
inside<00:01:16.819> you<00:01:17.240> can<00:01:17.329> see<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.600> strapping<00:01:17.990> system

inside you can see the strapping system

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.569 
inside you can see the strapping system
here<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:18.859> what<00:01:18.979> they're<00:01:19.100> called<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
portion connected to it too so you can

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.109 
portion connected to it too so you can
kind<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.649> help<00:01:39.859> customize<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.670> fit<00:01:40.819> a<00:01:40.880> little

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
kind of help customize the fit a little

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.910 
kind of help customize the fit a little
bit<00:01:41.270> with<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.569> as<00:01:41.780> well<00:01:42.259> as<00:01:42.350> take<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.649> out<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
bit with this as well as take it out to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.069 
bit with this as well as take it out to
decrease<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.549> drawing<00:01:43.819> time<00:01:44.149> all<00:01:44.840> right<00:01:44.929> so

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
decrease that drawing time all right so

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.480 
decrease that drawing time all right so
now<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.319> I<00:01:45.380> go<00:01:45.499> ahead<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:45.799> try<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.310> pad

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
now as I go ahead and try on the pad

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.340 
now as I go ahead and try on the pad
first<00:01:47.359> thing<00:01:47.569> you'll<00:01:47.659> notice<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.109> a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
first thing you'll notice it is a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.529 
first thing you'll notice it is a
narrower<00:01:48.799> profile<00:01:49.189> like<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.459> mentioned<00:01:49.880> so

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
narrower profile like I mentioned so

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.690 
narrower profile like I mentioned so
first<00:01:50.869> I'll<00:01:51.049> go<00:01:51.139> ahead<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.619> put<00:01:51.859> the<00:01:52.009> anchor

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
first I'll go ahead and put the anchor

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.669 
first I'll go ahead and put the anchor
strap<00:01:52.969> on<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:53.420> I'll<00:01:53.539> go<00:01:53.659> across<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.200> top<00:01:54.409> or

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
strap on so I'll go across the top or

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.620 
strap on so I'll go across the top or
the<00:01:54.740> upper<00:01:55.039> portion<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.520> calf<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.090> so

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the upper portion of the calf and so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.609 
the upper portion of the calf and so
that's<00:01:56.749> gonna<00:01:56.869> lock<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.289> pad<00:01:57.469> in<00:01:57.590> place

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
that's gonna lock the pad in place

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.959 
that's gonna lock the pad in place
that's<00:01:57.979> gonna<00:01:58.069> do<00:01:58.219> most<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.609> work<00:01:58.670> I'm

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
that's gonna do most of the work I'm

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.819 
that's gonna do most of the work I'm
keeping<00:01:59.299> it<00:01:59.389> in<00:01:59.420> place<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.899> then<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.560> lower

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
keeping it in place and then this lower

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.169 
keeping it in place and then this lower
one<00:02:01.039> will<00:02:01.249> just<00:02:01.429> go<00:02:01.520> around<00:02:01.639> the<00:02:01.849> bottom

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
one will just go around the bottom

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.160 
one will just go around the bottom
portion<00:02:02.359> of<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.719> pad

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170
