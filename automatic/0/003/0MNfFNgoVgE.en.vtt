but this was not a SummerSlam match in
my<00:00:19.619> mind<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:20.039> all<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> three-hour<00:00:21.060> raw

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
my mind at all this was a three-hour raw

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.870 
my mind at all this was a three-hour raw
match<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.769> waste<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> match

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
match if that waste of a match

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
match if that waste of a match
uninteresting<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.900> didn't<00:00:25.140> care<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
uninteresting I didn't care about it it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089 
uninteresting I didn't care about it it
was<00:00:26.599> about<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.810> good<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.349> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.650> expected

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
was about as good as I kind of expected

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
was about as good as I kind of expected
it<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.449> way<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it to be which in some way is a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.639 
it to be which in some way is a
compliment<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.189> some<00:00:32.430> ways<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.239> isn't<00:00:33.649> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
compliment and in some ways it isn't I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.610 
compliment and in some ways it isn't I
would<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.280> rather<00:00:35.460> had<00:00:35.940> them<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:37.590> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
would have rather had them do a lot of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
would have rather had them do a lot of
other<00:00:37.860> things<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.969> what

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
other things I don't really know what

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.369 
other things I don't really know what
necessarily<00:00:39.750> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> top<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.230> head

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
necessarily at the top of my head

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
necessarily at the top of my head
because<00:00:40.879> it<00:00:41.879> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.239> depends<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.629> what

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
because it kind of all depends on what

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
because it kind of all depends on what
their<00:00:42.960> plans<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> other<00:00:44.120> people<00:00:45.120> on

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
their plans are for the other people on

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.569 
their plans are for the other people on
the<00:00:45.360> card<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.829> Daniel<00:00:47.370> Bryan

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the card but I don't like Daniel Bryan

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
the card but I don't like Daniel Bryan
and<00:00:47.700> Kane<00:00:47.910> working<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.450> together<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.930> think

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and Kane working well together I think

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.750 
and Kane working well together I think
they've<00:00:49.559> had<00:00:49.739> enough<00:00:49.980> matches<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> they

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
they've had enough matches and they

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.139 
they've had enough matches and they
should<00:00:50.910> move<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> lot<00:00:53.760> better<00:00:53.879> than

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
should move on it was a lot better than

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
should move on it was a lot better than
my<00:00:54.180> expectations<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.129> exceeded

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
my expectations actually it exceeded

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
my expectations actually it exceeded
mine<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.300> thought<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> keep

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
mine I thought it was a good way to keep

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
mine I thought it was a good way to keep
the<00:00:59.010> momentum<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> show<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.120> honestly

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the momentum of the show going honestly

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
the momentum of the show going honestly

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
he's pretty limited but Brian kind of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.890 
he's pretty limited but Brian kind of
picked<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> pace<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> made<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> match

enjoyable and came throwing a tantrum is
funny<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> watch<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.900> thought<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> kept<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
funny to watch so I thought to kept the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.980 
funny to watch so I thought to kept the
momentum<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> show<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.930> it's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
momentum of the show going well but it's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.639 
momentum of the show going well but it's
it's<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> few<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.490> redundant<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649
