 isn't<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.830> plot<00:01:44.160> twist<00:01:44.930> five<00:01:45.930> years

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
 isn't that a plot twist five years

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.320 
 isn't that a plot twist five years
ago<00:01:46.350> he<00:01:46.590> attempted<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.220> build<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.640> gaygent<00:01:48.060> sort

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
ago he attempted to build a gaygent sort
