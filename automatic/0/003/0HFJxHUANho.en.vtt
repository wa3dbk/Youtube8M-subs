 coup I will be delighted to meet you I 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.109
 know that there are often who hesitate to 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.520
 come to see me because they did not want to 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.689

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.850

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.860
 extremely pleasure to meet you and 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.470
 to talk to you so on Thursday as I 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.440
 say it will be for me especially for 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.540
 visit the convention and after that we 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.290
 is going to go to plan as we go 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.210
 see together 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.910
 so it's big enough 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.400
 we're going to talk about the social corner 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.320
 which will interest us us so bye to 3 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.830
 3 pavilions game not if we can call 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.930
 that like that 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.730
 in any case you see that there are people 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.850
 there is something to do at the stands 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.250
 and suddenly me that night that lag to death 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.870
 or lolo hockey and so I think 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.110
 that we could meet at the social 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 sochaux for a corner simply because 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.620
 that bath and meetings a little bit 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.050
 subscribers and all who are going to be made there 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.990
 I guess so it will be in the pavilion 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.860
 3 next to gamesactu points like 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.800
 square enix from nightmare to and forgiveness 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.780
 I'm wrong I do not see too far 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.410
 alienware asus game one when you 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.820
 see it directly on the screen the plan 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.440
 I will put you the link to the paris 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.030
 games week the paris games week site 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.140
 if you want to come or if you do not 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.070
 not yet at the ticket or you want 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.050
 just information in the description 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.200
 so here we will be there so from 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.000
 14h on Friday and Saturday 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.760
 so that way it gives you time to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.580
 to come that lets you two 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.440
 have visited a little bit in the morning to 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.330
 those who get up late also that you 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.290
 give time to get up so here you go 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.180
 the ground corner on Friday and Saturday in 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.070
 from 14 hours there are no ends 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.780
 specific is when there is more than 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.190
 world that comes or when you have more 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.960
 of questions asked there would be 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.280
 really I could ask myself all 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.720
 questions you want even if you 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.280
 cross me too but there it will be 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.120
 really reserved for everyone this is at 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.370
 tell everyone will be there everyone 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.540
 will be able to trade you between you can 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:06.580
 discuss and so that's the idea that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:09.010
 I think so after yes we go 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.950
 move on to the game since I know it 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.030
 is not smooth in 1 interested so 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.470
 there are plenty of games going to be 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.510
 finally presented the cheek again cry 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.620
 assassin's creed you need is titles 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.870
 who speak I do not know half 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.050
 more than half in my opinion at stake 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.690
 video I'm really not an expert 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.270
 so that's it so I let you look 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.470
 there too you go on on the games that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.830

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.680
 so the exhibitors 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.960

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.260
 there is nintendo philips xbox a little bit of 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.270
 whorehouse 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:52.130

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:53.090

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.590
 machine that passed on the street 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.130
 I hope it did not destroy you 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.870
 ears so you baves walaja the fnac 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.050
 people like that I do not understand 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.090
 why they come but good too bad 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.320
 asus alienware for blacks too 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.670
 closer to gaming even if they 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.990
 also say but well done no matter 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.880
 they are there and at the level of the place so 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.270
 it is in paris expo porte de versailles 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.310
 so far south we'll say west of 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.680
 Paris 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.210
 so that's so if you do not know where it is 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.340
 you can type in paris expo door of 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.240
 versailles on google maps and he 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.580
 will offer you without hesitation me I know 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.750
 Well, it's not finally, it's not 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.490
 center of paris of the coup it's a little 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.520
 little transport but good anyway 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.520
 when it's to stop or elsewhere 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.540
 know exactly where it is when 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.280
 it's japan expo 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:49.490
 I am it is north of Paris but I 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.960
 more exactly where yeah I'm not I 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.360
 thought it's there in the games area 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:01.750
 not too much to watch paris expo villepinte 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.750
 no citypin citypinte ditch city 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.290
 here it is it is very far it is 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.800
 very very very far 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.180
 but good after that is part of my 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.620
 paris what yeah that's true it's 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.000
 before charles de gaulle which cuba is 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.980
 normal they are not in the city center 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.660
 because low and has a lot of people 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.720
 a job at the japan expo izagirre cent 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.620
 thousand people can you imagine that 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.880
 in full paris hundred thousand people 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.990
 it's a bit complicated so it's a 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.340
 little bit outside but that's when 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.080
 even less outside than by 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.750
 expos it's still it's close 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.320
 of Paris that's all right but I hope 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.460
 to see you many 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.290
 so if you meet me in the 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.849
 convention and any time no matter 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.669
 their come to see and if ever 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.619
 you can not be here I can 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.679
 send me on twitter or whatever and 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:46.889
 that you would be happy to meet me 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:48.479
 if anyway as I say I 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:51.509
 say them for the japan expo welcomes the 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.229
 I'll film again so I'll film with 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:56.309
 my little camera who knows where 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.149
 simply because I know that 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:58.559
 not everyone has the chance to come 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:02.119
 and I know that this is a 

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:04.499
 it's a super convention in general 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:06.029
 just because I meet you and 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:09.509
 that I rediscover things and that's 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:11.789
 So here I know that there are people 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.610
 for example from morocco or canada or 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.860
 others who do not have that kind of 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.479
 convention at home which are precisely 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.569
 a bit sad of the shot to take in 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.719
 video and show it to you it's nice 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.490
 shows you a little bit what it is 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:27.419
 so here I will film for those 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.490
 who can not come do you 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.419
 worry I'll show you game everything 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.490
 what I discovered a little bit 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.349
 there is in any case I hope when 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.319
 even see a maximum of people I hope 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:39.449
 also see other youtuber be it 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:41.759
 for dofus or other little matter month 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.949
 to see everyone that it tempts me well 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.869
 and discover lots of people that's why 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:49.439
 that I continue to do that too 

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:51.689
 that I therefore meet in part you 

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:52.709
 but also other people from youtube and 

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:54.479
 it was really nice
