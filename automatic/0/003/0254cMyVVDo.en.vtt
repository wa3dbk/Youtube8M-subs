00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.779
 only this part say let's go to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.779
 Remove the lid 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.590
 let's also take the part of 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.690
 this glass of coffee or frape we are going to 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:43.210
 occupy only the top all this stage 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 We will fill it well and already 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 we are ready to start 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.710
 the first step is to paint the lid 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.870
 our frappe we are going to paint all 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.579
 our around and even here with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.579
 acrylic white paint 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.810
 the next step is to prepare the color 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.340
 for our bread and I quote this is going to be 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.040
 our bread success in the under the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.500
 Now I'm going to reserve gelatin and go 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.780
 to prepare the color what I did is in a 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.690
 container in a glass of those that do not 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.480
 use with what enough of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.450
 flesh red color and I'm going to add a little 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.150
 of the dark brown color if you 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.370
 get a beige middle brown or 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 of the color that you like can be 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.550
 use me in this case I will do 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.970
 this mixture to get the color 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.970
 wanted 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.170
 all you have to do is start 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.170
 paint our bread success 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.070
 Now what we 're going to do is decorate the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.560
 part above we will use the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.010
 coffee color to simulate that you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.190
 we pour chocolate so I'll start 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.430
 make waves and right now they will see how it goes 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 to stay 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.800
 Hahaha 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:03:01.060
 all right 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:03:04.000
 and start decorating and the only thing 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.420
 let's do is take our pens 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.070
 of gel and we're going to make like little sticks 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.070
 on the entire surface of the chocolate 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.849
 and that's how we are staying in the 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.730
 top part and right now if you can see 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.049
 I made small spots simulating that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.090
 well we passed a little bit the 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.980
 chocolate if you want what can 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.069
 leave only with one up and what 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.349
 You can leave like that according to how you like it 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.180
 you like it if you do not want it very 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.250
 charged can not stop this way 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.670
 I'm going to put a little detail right now 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.630
 more then that little detail more is to place 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.030
 little 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.610
 beads or shakira 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.670
 I'm going to paste over the entire surface 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.650
 even in the white part I'm going to 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.990
 try to put a little more I will 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.890
 use a little silicon to 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.890
 help me with this 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.930
 nothing 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.010
 for cerecita the only thing that we are going to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.810
 to do is to use the match we are going to 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.139
 give a little bit of shape 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.930
 folded and we're going to remove this part if 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.240
 You can do it this way 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.590
 so we are going to remove it so as not to cut 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.930
 very well and now what we are going to use 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.920
 it's a bit of facing we're left with 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.020
 this way 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.690
 already with the tie and the only thing we're going to 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.360
 to do is to stick it to the pompom this is going to be 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.289
 our little branch of our selection at 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.080
 only thing to do is place it 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.439
 and close the pompom a little so that it 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.439
 stick 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.910
 thus 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.729
 and we press a little until it stays 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.830
 and we believe that it stays fixed 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.479
 in this case I decided to place what in the 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.849
 Orillita already put a little bit of 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:15.160
 cold silicon and the only thing that has to be 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:18.550
 to do is accommodate the pompom 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.650
 and let's wait a little while 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.150
 and that's how we have our bread 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.690
 cited as you can see here has its 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.300
 cervecita and I tried to assimilate although 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.030
 It would have looked like a stick 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.920
 milk chocolate in this case you 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.190
 well, they can play with colors 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.470
 If it's for a girl, they can place it 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.020
 pink and the pompom also colored 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.540
 pink if it is for a child then blue and 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.120
 arms you can play with this 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.730
 idea is only how I comment is 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.280
 an idea you can improve it and 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.460
 they can do it much better I invite them 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.770
 that if they do they send their photos to me 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.110
 facebook of carl and things and good 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.880
 I hope to be watching you in another video the 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.310
 I send many greetings and I thank you 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.500
 all the people who have supported me and 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.420
 who are still watching my videos I send them 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.190
 a hug very strong and good we are 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.190
 watching in another video bye bye 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.289
 two
