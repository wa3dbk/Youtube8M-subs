00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.460
 what to say here it is handsome here you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:16.789
 understand the lens and at 14 aperture the floor 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 intestine fixed fifty dollars with 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.560
 light sensitivity 14 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.240
 Well, I took it on purpose 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.689
 bought for videoing because he 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.410
 it happens very useful when 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.219
 the room is dark darkish that is he 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 rude and indispensable well here i have 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:45.270
 Ketsky ordinary Chinese lens 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:47.969
 chik-chik 1855 of course as for the initial 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 starting level he's just cool on 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.680
 really someone will say 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.340
 photographer yes it's all bullshit really 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.329
 the lens is worthy of its quality for 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 such a sum of which represents 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.489
 worth it if someone buys with such 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.770
 lens 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.650
 some amateur has never 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.830
 I used a DSLR for him to be 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.890
 it is a class heaven and earth 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:24.320
 So I bought for video shooting, that is 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.230
 Quite well worth the quality but 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.830
 how to say now is not enough not 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.720
 let's see how it will look in our 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.930
 fifty dollars 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:43.400
 On our . yes compared to whale 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.810
 lens. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.810
 harder will be 1 of 4 why 14 bought 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.110
 some say yes why not 18 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.510
 It seems to be the aperture there it does not hurt 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.230
 different you can do it 8 because 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.350
 what's the amount 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.430
 price differs me at times as first 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.060
 too atom counted on 18 there for 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.250
 photo he basically one can equally 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.150
 be there something different blur 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.550
 background but for video 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.560
 when i tried 141 and 818 from here it is 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.160
 here he is here here is a fragile little ring 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.630
 who the fuck so and strives to lubricate 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.600
 the focus is 14 of course he is here 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.410
 such a rubberized ring such 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.000
 rubberized 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 which is much more comfortable better 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.630
 be focused in any 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.440
 He on stand trip on 100 dikami 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.160
 you can just like and focus 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.190
 calm focus i already tried his focus 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.480
 focusing it straight smoothly clear 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:02.060
 so slow that is lubricate lubricate 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.570
 hard of course you can lubricate any on 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.390
 any lens but this is for me 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.020
 liked more and I survived naturally 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.000
 pretty tidy him and 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.190
 bought 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.930
 what they said for photo 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.900
 when the photo he is also very cool in 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.460
 premises that is with 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.890
 photosensitivity 14 you just 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.190
 superski 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.090
 fulfills their money here that 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.700
 more every photographer every 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.070
 videographer has availability 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:46.850
 14 fix a half a kilo there lens 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.090
 just awesome with him I shot 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.290
 different things the rooms that is if 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.410
 let's say ketovsky lens with him 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.000
 aperture 1335 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.760
 minimum that is maximum 35 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.660
 the diaphragm opens then it is natural 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:11.660
 miss very big noise and and sos 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:15.560
 lifted shutter lowered then nowhere 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.820
 There is he in this plan not cope 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.500
 Of course, it would still be possible to take 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.620
 some titmouse 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.330
 you can't count on canon because 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.569
 that price is a very expensive thing for someone 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.490
 have grandmas let him buy them 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.369
 but I think in the future somehow 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.110
 buy sigma for Crop of course 

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:46.159
 1770 most likely though recommends me 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:48.979
 yet in 2480 but still I think that in 1770 with 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:52.369
 light and sensitive shorter with 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.309
 diaphragm 2 and 8 will be constantly I thought 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:59.899
 quite enough for my eyes and zoom there 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:05:02.930
 there is an aperture ratio but it has enough 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:07.849
 Fifty with its 14 simply irreplaceable 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.999
 as they say in dark rooms or in 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.709
 twilight either sometime with shooting if u 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:14.899
 you have light then you can not here 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:16.879
 I speak right away 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.629
 light does not fuck do not need, and so on so 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:22.309
 Iâ€™ll better shoot with light 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.769
 welcome, of course ask me this 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:27.949
 there is no light, and so on a microphone to it already 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:32.209
 I came I have a microphone and a tripod with 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.459
 tonic and so on that is like 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:38.979
 says someone will say more but he 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:42.080
 so uncomfortable only shoots here 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.629
 staged scenes yes it is designed for 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.419
 staging scene well, you can 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:50.889
 put together of course and so on but all 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.539
 have to do with their feet if it affects 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.119
 do not treat the sport do not want 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.939
 run buy data cable pieces from you 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:01.339
 like an elephant's trunk then swept over 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:03.949
 moved ev3 don't shoot 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:07.339
 let's say on the video that there once and 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:13.219
 shot once and moved like that 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:16.039
 Here's the case, I chose it myself fifty years old 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:20.360
 and run legs here and there 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:23.899
 ran ran ran ran thing 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.900
 class advise everyone if you shoot 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:27.960
 video 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.910
 on the SLR then such a lens 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:36.449
 you should be in your pocket of course 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:41.699
 same 1 and 2 it goes only with us fifty dollars 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:42.660
 it costs him a fucking cloud of money in principle 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:47.699
 difference 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:51.889
 with 1 and 4 hire know the difference if only 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.340
 12 heavy more heavy he damn it 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:57.930
 by far 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:04.949
 of probably 800 grams worth this weighs 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:09.389
 ug probably how many grams probably can 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:10.229
 be 250 300 just can not say but 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:16.680
 one 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:18.840
 barely it is worth just that 14 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.539
 the coolest best option if 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.810
 You can certainly shoot at 18 because 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.090
 someone has no money for 18 watts but this 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.210
 Here is a heartless little ring damn it so 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.139
 uncomfortable and tries to fuck focus 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.139
 take it
