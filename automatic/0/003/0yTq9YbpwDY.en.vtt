00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.360
 Hi there, you're on alex beach and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.730
 today's issue will be dedicated 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.400
 Tachaydi sensors did not have time to start 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.750
 first sales of iphone 5s like on the internet 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.480
 articles have already appeared 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.189
 and then a video about how easy hackers are 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.590
 hacked this tricky defense 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.169
 some videos are so realistic 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.300
 It shows how this is done that at first I 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.250
 and really believed this nonsense myself 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.560
 imprinting process 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.780
 a thick layer of toner of course no 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.510
 no problem but the following 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.040
 unlocking iphone 5s with this 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.440
 dash paper from drawing on it 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.540
 foundation of my father caused 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.580
 doubts father specialty 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.830
 electronic engineer and after viewing this 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.350
 video his there was no doubt 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.390
 what is it fake that apple is not kindergarten and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.240
 Dacha disco it takes from the finger not only 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.160
 imprint in the end to resolve the dispute 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.210
 we have tried other methods of application 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.640
 imprint 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.799
 but unlock the phone with a piece of paper and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.619
 failed pity but we just for nothing 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.140
 spent a lot of time on a dry piece of paper 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.659
 the sensor does not react at all, but to a wet one 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 any kinds of prints are asked twice 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.929
 to repeat 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.909
 and then enter the password I will tell you one thing 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.859
 who makes such a beautiful video 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.139
 knows what to make people massive 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.249
 interest in your commercials is only possible 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:29.229
 on the apple side 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.179
 so about anything else and do not soar 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.759
 tell so let's all the same 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.009
 let 's review the tachadi sensor and see 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.049
 How does he work 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:45.179
 To set up, go to 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:49.569
 building key passwords imprint 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.340
 prints and add a fingerprint when 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.709
 You may wish to add a few 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.029
 prints 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.119
 scan your finger with several 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:01.200
 touches to the sensor 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.149
 may ask to do this up to 10 times 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.939
 after the scan is completed, click 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.910
 continue button 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.990
 that's all the data saved takachidi ready 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.640
 to use 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.470
 holy moment unlock your 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.160
 phone you can not only with 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.340
 password 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.470
 believe in practice it is very convenient in 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.140
 one touch opens your phone 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.690
 pleases also that now it is not necessary 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.200
 the problem of forgotten passwords 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.240
 you may notice that the identification 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.410
 everything happens fine without 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.780
 any glitches 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.000
 one touch and phone unlocked 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.370
 very comfortable and I already managed it 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 like to download the application site mts 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.000
 webstore 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.890
 as you see just one touch we see 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.140
 application in download mode 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.909
 to scan a print at all 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.790
 do not have to hold the phone every time 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.989
 in the same position 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.989
 want to hold the phone horizontally 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.620
 everything will work fine even if 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.620
 you take your phone riding down 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.730
 tachadi absolutely no difference 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:21.420
 do not doubt it as you wish 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.120
 Tachadi sensor is the introduction of which 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.099
 there is a big future in the conclusion I will show 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.739
 one example for those who are still 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.450
 and continue to believe that fake video or 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.640
 even if not believing but being 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.440
 supporter android tries somehow 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.670
 sting the owners in the best in the world 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.470
 phone iphone 5s agree if 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.660
 save on such a sensor 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.660
 imprint something from a glass of nothing 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:51.180
 you cannot even scan it 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.489
 if you give the owners of iphone 5s sleeping pills 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.639
 anyway find a body part which 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.560
 saved by phone the sensor will fail 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.500
 iphone absolutely no difference what 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 scan the lobe or even his 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.200
 the outside reality is chatting 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.329
 iphone 5s sensor is much smarter than we are 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.489
 can imagine before him 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.459
 introducing your product engineer and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.739
 corrected a lot of different tests a little 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.750
 the fact that the sensor also measures 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.479
 resistance capacity and other parameters 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.820
 of our body in addition to this program with 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.940
 which he collects every time 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.530
 and you have more and more information and in 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.020
 near future with updates 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.389
 scanner firmware this program will become 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.190
 even more intellectual work 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.289
 scanner will be close to ideal 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.110
