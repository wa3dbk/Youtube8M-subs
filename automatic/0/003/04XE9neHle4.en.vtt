simulation<00:03:27.050> so<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.220> want<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.550> play

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
simulation so if you want to play

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.540 
simulation so if you want to play
authentic<00:03:29.570> sports<00:03:29.870> simulations<00:03:30.560> come<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.400> EA

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
authentic sports simulations come to EA

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.580 
authentic sports simulations come to EA
Sports<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.690> want<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.930> play<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.170> story<00:03:33.440> of

Sports if you want to play the story of
frequency<00:03:34.100> vibrations<00:03:34.700> go<00:03:35.269> somewhere<00:03:35.660> else

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
frequency vibrations go somewhere else

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.000 
frequency vibrations go somewhere else
wretches<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.570> man<00:03:38.750> register<00:03:39.500> man<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.860> got

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
wretches the man register man I got

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.060 
wretches the man register man I got
couple<00:03:40.280> more<00:03:40.400> questions<00:03:40.580> i'ma<00:03:40.970> let<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.209> go<00:03:41.360> oh

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
couple more questions i'ma let you go oh

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.670 
couple more questions i'ma let you go oh
the<00:03:43.239> passing<00:03:44.239> how<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:44.989> call<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.320> was<00:03:45.650> a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
the passing how you call it was a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.710 
the passing how you call it was a
passing<00:03:46.190> cinematic<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.150> guys<00:03:47.330> have

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
passing cinematic that you guys have

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.449 
passing cinematic that you guys have
added<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> game<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:48.980> when<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.160> throw<00:03:49.340> the

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
added to the game so when you throw the

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.640 
added to the game so when you throw the
ball<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:49.820> zooming<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.540> talk<00:03:51.380> about

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
ball it's like zooming in talk about

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.500 
ball it's like zooming in talk about
that<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.160> will<00:03:52.580> we<00:03:52.670> see<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.030> more<00:03:53.330> areas

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
that and will we see that in more areas

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.690 
that and will we see that in more areas
of<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.900> game<00:03:54.110> because<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:54.380> think<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.700> changes

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
of the game because I think that changes

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.370 
of the game because I think that changes
the<00:03:55.850> game<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.300> brings<00:03:56.570> more<00:03:56.810> excitement<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.350> it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
the game it brings more excitement to it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.520 
the game it brings more excitement to it

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
from NFL Films is really just pushing

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.660 
from NFL Films is really just pushing
the<00:04:03.290> envelope<00:04:03.320> in<00:04:03.890> terms<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:04.220> cameras<00:04:04.640> and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the envelope in terms of cameras and

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.670 
the envelope in terms of cameras and
what<00:04:04.910> we're<00:04:05.060> doing<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.840> if<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.019> play<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:06.410> zoom

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
what we're doing so if you play in zoom

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.380 
what we're doing so if you play in zoom
camera<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:07.310> year<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.730> pass<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.209> ball

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
camera this year and you pass the ball

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.300 
camera this year and you pass the ball
you'll<00:04:09.019> see<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.440> camera<00:04:09.739> gets<00:04:09.860> closer<00:04:10.190> and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
you'll see the camera gets closer and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.190 
you'll see the camera gets closer and
actually<00:04:10.610> follows<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.090> ball<00:04:11.269> in<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:12.019> get<00:04:12.170> a

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
actually follows the ball in to get a

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.960 
actually follows the ball in to get a
much<00:04:12.410> more<00:04:12.590> cinematic<00:04:13.070> version<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.760> catch

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
much more cinematic version of the catch

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.819 
much more cinematic version of the catch
and<00:04:14.570> now<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:14.959> have<00:04:14.989> multiplayer<00:04:15.380> catch

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
and now that we have multiplayer catch

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.229 
and now that we have multiplayer catch
interactions<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:17.000> get<00:04:17.090> these<00:04:17.180> really

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
interactions you get these really

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.930 
interactions you get these really
amazing<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.979> know<00:04:19.010> interactions<00:04:19.760> where<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
amazing you know interactions where the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.370 
amazing you know interactions where the
DB<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.540> wide<00:04:20.660> receiver<00:04:21.019> are<00:04:21.079> fighting

amazing<00:04:25.280> now<00:04:25.640> player<00:04:26.060> stats<00:04:26.260> now<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.710> played<00:04:28.190> a

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
amazing now player stats now I played a

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.550 
amazing now player stats now I played a
lot<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.610> mana<00:04:28.760> games<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.450> some<00:04:30.229> better<00:04:30.470> than

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
lot of mana games and some better than

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.550 
lot of mana games and some better than
others<00:04:30.770> obviously<00:04:31.180> but<00:04:32.180> sometimes<00:04:33.169> i<00:04:33.350> feel

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
others obviously but sometimes i feel

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.880 
others obviously but sometimes i feel
like<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.370> stats<00:04:34.729> don't<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:36.169> actually<00:04:36.620> match

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
like the stats don't like actually match

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.770 
like the stats don't like actually match
the<00:04:37.400> player<00:04:37.610> abilities<00:04:38.150> at<00:04:38.330> times<00:04:38.539> for

the player abilities at times for

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.590 
the player abilities at times for
example<00:04:39.229> you<00:04:39.740> already<00:04:40.490> know<00:04:40.610> beast<00:04:40.880> mode<00:04:41.120> is

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
example you already know beast mode is

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.240 
example you already know beast mode is
bespoke<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.440> don't<00:04:42.590> saying<00:04:42.800> Marshawn

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
bespoke you don't saying Marshawn

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.190 
bespoke you don't saying Marshawn
Lynch's<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.700> do<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.510> sometimes<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.990> feel

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
Lynch's that do but sometimes I feel

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.070 
Lynch's that do but sometimes I feel
like<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.850> second<00:04:46.850> stream<00:04:47.060> running<00:04:47.270> back<00:04:47.539> it's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
like a second stream running back it's

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.390 
like a second stream running back it's
doing<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.320> same<00:04:48.470> things<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:48.890> he's<00:04:49.130> doing
