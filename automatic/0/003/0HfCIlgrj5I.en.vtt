00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.949
 greetings gal that andré we are 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.230
 back in the deadly kombat 10 for one more 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.570
 combo tutorial and this time a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.039
 combo tutorial with when che in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.679
 wizard variation and this time the how 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.600
 The guys work there, you saw them there. 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.320
 prove that all functional defending with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.850
 the bodies 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 he hit school to defend himself 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.399
 automatically he is arguing that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.860
 the combo left 37% damage that is only 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 a bar as pretty cool enough 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.789
 there and who lived this combo was victor 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.860
 denis 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.800
 he had sent a commander with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.620
 Kochi who took approximately only 50% of damage 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.440
 that the combo was unfeasible and then I 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.149
 I took it out of the air like your opponent. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 could defend in the middle of the combo and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.460
 this was what happened with opinion 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.010
 perfect and 50% damage is a lot but 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.590
 unfortunately had this problem 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.619
 I do not know if it was a one update that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.570
 did and ended up taking this combo or 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.790
 if it was really a slip but at least 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.119
 any way to redeem the 20th 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.640
 victor sent me this combo here 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.439
 which is quite strong and draws 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 37% damage 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.579
 if you are not playing in the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.799
 playstation 4 conversion of commands 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.040
 is there in the description well enough and how 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.650
 he may have got off the ground with the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.939
 simple combo resuscitator that is behind 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.650
 x triangle ball or we can start 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:49.340
 giving that famous cascudo 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.750
 Okay, there you go, whatever you think 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.960
 easy 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.870
 well I'll start with a rattlesnake because 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.250
 I do not think it's difficult and we win cause 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.850
 more damage 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.890
 You saw that I made the end of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.520
 end of the rescuer suspends the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.200
 opponent 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.220
 so we have to hit the ball only 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 But it rose close ball after 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.900
 Send me the ball, you send the traffic. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.180
 backwards x does not have to be fast 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.510
 too much can be but it can be softer 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.820
 so it does not have to be desperate because 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.340
 enough time for you to send the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.530
 trance sent the traffic the enemy goes 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.090
 come in your direction 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.890
 done that we have to send the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.600
 combo annihilation and cancel in burst 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.330
 terrestrial but it has to be burst 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.010
 land and it has to be 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.940
 improved 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.640
 first of all let's learn to walk 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.870
 already terrestrial next is simple people 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.850
 will ask you back down 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.580
 square 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.580
 We'll keep holding back. 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.600
 thus 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.500
 so she'll always leave next now 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.920
 I do not know if it's a problem, or what? 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.500
 it's no use hitting r2 together 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.900
 of the square 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.250
 I do not know, it almost never works 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.510
 now it 's working not always 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.989
 it works 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.840
 I do not know when it tightens together 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:31.280
 exactly together does not work if the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.330
 squeeze otpp together together again not 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.150
 it works 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.220
 pressing the frame or r2 button 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.330
 to work together does not work but if 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.330
 you press later 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.820
 works to improve this 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.440
 ground burst 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.930
 You have to squeeze both after 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.140
 pressing the square does not 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.390
 r2 next to the square 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.390
 sure my tip that I give the following 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.310
 look me and twice the r2 because you 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.380
 will annihilate annihilation anyway 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.630
 canceling this will cancel annihilation 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.700
 in the blast until this next you go 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.230
 send all direct movements as 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.640
 if it were one thing and that is what the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.010
 cancel né 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.690
 only you cancel without improving 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.630
 but as soon as you finish tightening the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.340
 trs raja square next you go 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.890
 keep holding back and will stay 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.520
 pressing the r2 like a madman 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:31.900
 so it will hone and this way 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.940
 looks have four times of r 2 and even more 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.169
 now that's how we get better 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.350
 let's see how is fighting this 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.350
 stage 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:48.319
 From here until this stage 32% damage is already a 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.059
 as quite good is relatively easy 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.369
 Just get the moms these tips I 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.080
 I left you guys who have no 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:55.729
 opponent is going to rise now is part one 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.259
 A little more complicated here, but I 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.069
 went up quickly you have to send the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:04.039
 squatting with the payment portal of the 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.869
 portal, rather than down to the 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.229
 down down down down 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:11.449
 and triangle face that I'm sleepy 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.930
 so what happens you 'll send 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.979
 This blow here you have to send 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.569
 It's kind of bizarre because you're going to 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.999
 in another special face then you have 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.330
 to be quick to get out of this way to 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.409
 We're going to fall and the wind 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.849
 next 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.149
 When it is high on you 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.620
 Send the worsening beauty portal 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:37.209
 so let's see how is the combo 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.209
 complete once more 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.850
 hence 37% of damage as quite legal 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.530
 enough there and I came back I liked it 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.120
 call I got out I found that not 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.970
 finish with this grip of the 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.880
 portal right after this special 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.560
 here is I think it gets interesting 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.210
 This is a little hard to be 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.710
 because you have to get the team 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.880
 one last tip I can leave to 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.860
 you the following point is not sending the 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.150
 grabbing the portal straight as if 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.150
 it was one thing 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.250
 you have to stop sending it is that 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.620
 time you have to get the one 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.760
 part more complicated if as here it is 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.090
 this end 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:29.600
 that's when we'll try again 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:31.430
 wrong paper there one more time just get 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.700
 this team if you do it straight will not 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:39.260
 then workout and only train if 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:43.670
 this stage and only this stage that first 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:46.900
 I think it will help right? 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.900
 this more complicated step 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.870
 There, beauty, there you go, picking it up. 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.490
 Time for sure you'll be sending 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.889
 straight as the rest 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.320
 the first part is quite simple no 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:02.820
 You have no mystery 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.770
 I'll end this video by 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.449
 here thank you very much for having watched 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.830

 subscribe to the channel will follow the 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.009
 twitter facebook 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.570
 the link is in the description does not leave 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.759

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.289
 video if you greatly help the channel 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.850
 time you saw mandel as while 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.919
 I was not even talking to you 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.389
 concentrate is just a matter of picking up the team 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.370
 it 's training question 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.470
 even though it is legal to send to 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.870
 Let's leave it in the video comments. 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.520
 all the steps of the combo 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.800
 just can not be a field that has passed 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.479
 here is obviously a combo of a 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.110
 variation that has already passed through 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.210
 on here 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.610
 the thigh for example is you can no longer 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.530
 send a variation 1 as in the evaluation 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.259
 wizard has another evaluation of the thigh also 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.030
 We already did but now I do not remember. 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.430
 You want to know which evaluation has passed 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.280
 here is just a click on the playlist of 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.780
 mortal kombat the link is in the inscription 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.039
 guys will finalizing the video here 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.960
 again thank you very much until 

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.960
 next and may the force be with you
