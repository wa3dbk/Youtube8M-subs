00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.890
 hello and welcome to lift soon 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 today an article on the management of 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.450
 water storage 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.910
 little reminder mid temperate as we have 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.730
 in France without activity we need 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 two liters of water per day per person 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.170
 for the functioning of the human body 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.180
 that's without solid food without 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.980
 food stop the three reminds us 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.219
 also that we can stay three days 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.069
 without drinking of course that's provided 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.460
 to have a thermoregulation system 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:42.249
 at the top so a term principle in 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.420
 regulating which is really optimum for 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:43.809
 we already see it on the courses of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.609
 survival 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.120
 I will not go back to the 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.789
 thermoregulation is not the goal of 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.260
 this article I'm just going to introduce you 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.049
 the happy I will ignore 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.030
 all that is paul chaoul type e 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:02.949
 platypus camelback source also the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.809
 bags that can be found at 4.5 euros 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.700
 at decathlon I will not talk about it 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.960
 because for me the posts are 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.080
 completely useless it serves strictly 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.700
 nothing so we try to side we go 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.010
 just sticking to material that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.740
 I find it essential so this 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.770
 are cans we for info I you 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.410
 I put a gourd in decathlon 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.570
 seen on on the video so you 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.490
 can see the size of containers 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.390
 compared to the gourd of a myth 5 2 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.390
 in decathlon even the water cover 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.000
 that I already presented 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.640
 from karine hoc who she can 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.760
 contain 4 liters already much more 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.090
 big as the court in Dichato then 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.670
 it is true that it is the village of the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.920
 debauchery where it's cow and donations that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.830
 this water cover once these 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.550
 rows and store it takes this 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.110
 size what 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.570
 it's really negligible compared 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.100
 to chebika gour early is exactly 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.810
 the same utility plus it's more 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.120
 easy to fill it's easier to 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.080
 store is less heavy 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.820
 why bother to take classes 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.340
 from ducati 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.270
 in short the rest of the systems that I you 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.490
 present here these are systems based 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.810
 on cans we so there are two 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.770
 important things to know about a can 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.010
 we are firstly the handle here 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.770
 I allow myself the transport of 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.020
 container end of the water container is 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.090
 also here the spillway 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.590
 there are different types of spillway and 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.850
 if we are two identical pairs of 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.940
 size of different sizes 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.620
 here we have a 20 liter can they are 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.310
 a million of 30 says he on the plane 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.170
 48 I will dwell a little more on the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.990
 bottle of 20 liters of brandy including 38 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.850
 48 years old herself lingering on this can there 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.200
 so why two hyper handles 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.970
 important to have the wrist on 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.880
 can wear it to 2 we're not trying 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.790
 to bother alone to carry 20 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.010
 kg know that 20 liters of fleet is 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.830
 a kilo bring so valid his twenty 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 kilos so here we have to boigne and for 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.500
 can carry 20 kg on big cans 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.209
 like there's 40 kg for wear 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.070
 to 2 so that one divides 20 kg by 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.910
 person is not negligible 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.420
 the spillway that here is the same 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.120
 super easy to use in water 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.880
 and to be able to close our system of 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.140
 things to know about on the water 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.100
 firstly we can have a water 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.880
 drinking and we can have a clear water 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.920
 so drinking water is not 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.230
 necessarily clear and clear water is not 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.220
 not necessarily drinkable after all that 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.700
 is short on the water I do not want to 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.070
 return 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.870
 we're already coming back from his 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.160
 survival stage to lift m 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.250
 I'll leave that aside 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.500
 really stick to containers in 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.640
 them even if you do not have info on 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.710
 the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.060
 the treatment of the water itself is 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.069
 well come in training with us says 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.000
 not how is it going 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.840
 so me what I recommend is 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.780
 to have this kind of cans this kind of 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.990
 bilo see what are 1,600 or even brothers 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.360
 have a lot more solid same system 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.590
 two handles is the same if ever 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.630
 you do not have the opportunity to 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.880
 find that kind of me that we're going 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.239
 actually in supermarkets 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.240
 we can end up with cans 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.660
 simple woody like this always 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.250
 same with an opening system on 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.580
 fills the water we close 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.430
 we have a spillway here to be able to 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.070
 serve in water the only problem is the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.440
 handle actually we can always 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.360
 find but if it is to compensate for 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.030
 that or not that a piece of wood on the door 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.500
 at 2 good it's a possibility but 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.330
 wear this kind of system alone 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.740
 it's heavy to try binding so 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.240
 I recommend you to have points 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.970
 systems with double wrist like 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.500
 that's what that means on the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.540
 on containers and storage 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.229
 of water it was a small article for 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.229
