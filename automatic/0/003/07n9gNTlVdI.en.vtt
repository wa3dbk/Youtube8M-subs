00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.570 

run<00:00:25.080> your<00:00:25.170> hands<00:00:25.410> across<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.070> bottom<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> can

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
run your hands across the bottom you can

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.589 
run your hands across the bottom you can
really<00:00:26.820> feel<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.260> high<00:00:28.260> spot<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> low<00:00:29.820> spot<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
really feel a high spot or a low spot I

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
really feel a high spot or a low spot I
mean<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.500> obviously<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.250> we're<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
mean you can obviously see that we're a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.209 
mean you can obviously see that we're a
little<00:00:32.880> low<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.149> still<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.890> just<00:00:34.890> keeping

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
little low here still but just keeping

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
little low here still but just keeping
the<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> dig<00:00:36.270> into<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the you don't want to dig into this and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
the you don't want to dig into this and
try<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> make<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:38.670> let's<00:00:38.940> just

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
try to make it up right now let's just

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.990 
try to make it up right now let's just
keep<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.890> shaping<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> board<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:41.730> whole

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
keep on shaping the board is one whole

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.260 
keep on shaping the board is one whole
thing<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:43.290> stop<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> dig

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
thing don't don't stop in here and dig

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.750 
thing don't don't stop in here and dig
away<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.899> trying<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> hit<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> home<00:00:47.219> run<00:00:47.250> with

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
away and trying to hit a home run with

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.840 
away and trying to hit a home run with
every<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.239> stroke<00:00:52.219> more<00:00:53.219> important<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
every little stroke more important that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.040 
every little stroke more important that
it's<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.239> stays<00:00:55.020> flat

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.280 

once<00:00:59.950> you<00:01:00.070> start<00:01:00.370> shaping<00:01:00.910> off<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.840> bottom<00:01:02.230> a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
once you start shaping off the bottom a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.390 
once you start shaping off the bottom a
little<00:01:02.380> bit<00:01:02.620> you'll<00:01:02.770> notice<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
little bit you'll notice that the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.640 
little bit you'll notice that the
stringer<00:01:03.790> will<00:01:03.910> start<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.270> pop<00:01:04.480> up<00:01:04.650> that's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
stringer will start to pop up that's

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.350 
stringer will start to pop up that's
when<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.100> great<00:01:06.310> time<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.730> break<00:01:06.940> out<00:01:07.090> this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
when it's a great time to break out this

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.590 
when it's a great time to break out this
hand<00:01:07.600> planner<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.790> hit<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.150> string<00:01:10.450> or

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
hand planner and just hit the string or

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.190 
hand planner and just hit the string or
a<00:01:10.630> loan<00:01:11.130> careful<00:01:12.130> not<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.810> don't<00:01:13.930> want<00:01:14.110> to

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
a loan careful not to you don't want to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.320 
a loan careful not to you don't want to
reshape<00:01:14.620> this<00:01:14.890> bottom<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.490> much<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:16.090> you

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
reshape this bottom that much so you

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.570 
reshape this bottom that much so you
just<00:01:16.840> really<00:01:17.200> want<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.500> just<00:01:17.680> take<00:01:18.520> a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
just really want to just take a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
just really want to just take a
consistent<00:01:19.390> smooth<00:01:20.110> cut<00:01:20.530> off<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.730> string<00:01:22.030> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
consistent smooth cut off the string I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.730 
consistent smooth cut off the string I
usually<00:01:23.710> start<00:01:23.980> somewhere<00:01:24.400> around<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.780> apex

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
usually start somewhere around the apex

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.020 
usually start somewhere around the apex
of<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.780> bottom<00:01:28.780> contour<00:01:29.410> so<00:01:30.250> which<00:01:30.880> is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
of the bottom contour so which is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.400 
of the bottom contour so which is
generally<00:01:31.510> around<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.440> middle<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.830> board

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
generally around the middle of the board

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.490 
generally around the middle of the board
and<00:01:35.410> just<00:01:35.440> flow<00:01:35.950> right<00:01:36.220> off<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.550> nose<00:01:37.500> once

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
and just flow right off the nose once

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.020 
and just flow right off the nose once
I'm<00:01:38.680> pretty<00:01:38.860> happy<00:01:39.130> with<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.580> relatively

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
I'm pretty happy with the relatively

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.050 
I'm pretty happy with the relatively
flat<00:01:41.190> got<00:01:42.190> most<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:43.710> marks<00:01:44.710> out<00:01:44.920> I'm<00:01:45.910> going

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
flat got most of the marks out I'm going

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.420 
flat got most of the marks out I'm going
to<00:01:46.119> go<00:01:46.180> ahead<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.450> slip<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.750> over<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
to go ahead and slip it over the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.100 
to go ahead and slip it over the
stringer<00:01:48.430> is<00:01:48.490> pretty<00:01:48.940> hard<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.300> shape<00:01:49.570> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
stringer is pretty hard to shape so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.550 
stringer is pretty hard to shape so
usually<00:01:51.510> tend<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.570> get<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:52.780> down<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.440> then

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
usually tend to get that down and then

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
usually tend to get that down and then
you<00:01:53.650> can<00:01:53.770> shape<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.190> foam<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.670> string

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.469 

starting<00:02:01.000> on<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.240> high<00:02:01.390> points<00:02:01.840> always<00:02:02.200> first
