life though most professional schemes

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.099 
life though most professional schemes
utilize<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> combination<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:57.899> gap

utilize a combination of one into gap
defenders<00:00:58.590> across<00:00:58.980> multiple<00:00:59.190> fronts<00:00:59.640> but

again<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:01.109> madden<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> we'll<00:01:01.920> find<00:01:02.129> out<00:01:02.250> soon

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
again with madden is we'll find out soon

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.130 
again with madden is we'll find out soon
enough<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:03.210> safe<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.600> reject<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> concept

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
enough it's safe to reject the concept

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
enough it's safe to reject the concept
of<00:01:04.559> hybrid<00:01:04.949> defenses<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> instead<00:01:06.030> focus<00:01:06.060> on

of hybrid defenses and instead focus on

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
of hybrid defenses and instead focus on
the<00:01:06.659> basics<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.380> traditional<00:01:07.830> three

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
four or four three formations so let's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.230
