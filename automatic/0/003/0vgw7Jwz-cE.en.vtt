in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.359> tutorial<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> teach<00:00:01.230> you

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
in this tutorial I'm going to teach you

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.559 
in this tutorial I'm going to teach you
how<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.589> drop<00:00:01.800> box<00:00:01.829> and<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:06.060> drop<00:00:06.240> box<00:00:06.420> is

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
how to the drop box and the drop box is

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.509 
how to the drop box and the drop box is
obviously<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.930> variation<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> box<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.250> out

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
obviously a variation on the box so out

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.950 
obviously a variation on the box so out
of<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> box<00:00:08.820> go<00:00:09.300> learn<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.690> then<00:00:09.809> come

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
of the box go learn it and then come

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.870 
of the box go learn it and then come
back<00:00:10.110> now<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.010> drop<00:00:11.250> box<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.639> slightly

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
back now the drop box is slightly

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.910 
back now the drop box is slightly
different<00:00:12.150> because<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:13.320> bottom<00:00:13.679> ball

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
different because the bottom ball

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.919 
different because the bottom ball
follows<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> different<00:00:14.969> trajectory<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.780> rest

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
follows a different trajectory the rest

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.090 
follows a different trajectory the rest
of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> pattern<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.560> pretty<00:00:16.590> much<00:00:16.830> exactly

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
of the pattern is pretty much exactly

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.040 
of the pattern is pretty much exactly
the<00:00:17.369> same<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> bottom<00:00:18.449> ball<00:00:18.630> instead<00:00:18.960> of

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the same but the bottom ball instead of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.750 
the same but the bottom ball instead of
being<00:00:19.260> thrown<00:00:19.439> back<00:00:19.740> out<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.279> hands

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
being thrown back out of your hands

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.490 
being thrown back out of your hands
before<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.420> vertical<00:00:21.750> ball<00:00:21.869> comes<00:00:22.080> down<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
before the vertical ball comes down is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400 
before the vertical ball comes down is
thrown<00:00:23.130> over<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.670> vertical<00:00:23.939> balls<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.600> they

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
thrown over the vertical balls as they

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
thrown over the vertical balls as they
drop<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:25.859> slice<00:00:26.070> problem<00:00:26.369> prop<00:00:26.490> box<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
drop which slice problem prop box so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.730 
drop which slice problem prop box so
movement<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.109> slightly<00:00:28.289> different

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
movement here is slightly different

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.439 
movement here is slightly different
whereas<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> box<00:00:29.429> you'd<00:00:29.760> go<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.240> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
whereas in the box you'd go like this in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.580 
whereas in the box you'd go like this in
the<00:00:30.539> drop<00:00:30.750> box<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:34.500> way

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the drop box and go like this the way

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990 
the drop box and go like this the way
this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> done<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> kind<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.399> tricky<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
this is done is kind of tricky the way I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.970 
this is done is kind of tricky the way I
do<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> horizontal<00:00:37.410> ball<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
do it is as the horizontal ball is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
do it is as the horizontal ball is
thrown<00:00:38.280> into<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.700> hand<00:00:38.940> after<00:00:39.149> about<00:00:39.450> vertical

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
thrown into my hand after about vertical

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.750 
thrown into my hand after about vertical
from<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.230> move<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> horizontal<00:00:41.010> ball<00:00:41.370> over<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
from I move the horizontal ball over to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
from I move the horizontal ball over to
the<00:00:41.850> side<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:42.239> hand<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.079> middle

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the side of my hand so like my middle

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.290 
the side of my hand so like my middle
finger<00:00:43.590> my<00:00:43.770> index<00:00:44.219> finger<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.730> thumb<00:00:44.760> hold

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
finger my index finger and my thumb hold

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.880 
finger my index finger and my thumb hold
the<00:00:45.420> ball<00:00:45.570> there's<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> open<00:00:46.530> space<00:00:46.710> right

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the ball there's this open space right

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.950 
the ball there's this open space right
here<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.969> vertical<00:00:48.329> level<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.570> coming<00:00:48.840> up

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
here as this vertical level is coming up

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
here as this vertical level is coming up
I<00:00:49.079> move<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.379> hand<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:49.950> getting

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I move my hand out to the side getting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
I move my hand out to the side getting
ready<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> bash<00:00:51.120> across<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
ready to bash across and do like a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
ready to bash across and do like a
shuffle<00:00:52.440> throw<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.550> ball<00:00:53.789> starts<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
shuffle throw and as this ball starts to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.369 
shuffle throw and as this ball starts to
come<00:00:54.239> down<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.449> wait<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> exact<00:00:55.170> right

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
come down you wait for the exact right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
come down you wait for the exact right
moment<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.770> once<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.219> sweet<00:00:56.520> spot

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
moment and once is in that sweet spot

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.340 
moment and once is in that sweet spot
you're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> throw<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.809> ball<00:00:58.020> down<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

you're going to throw this ball down to
your<00:00:58.620> other<00:00:58.680> hand<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.160> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> scoop<00:01:00.210> under

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
facing palm up the whole time so it's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
say I'm gonna force to move down and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
say I'm gonna force to move down and
smack<00:01:15.270> into<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> other<00:01:15.750> hand<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.500> ball<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
smack into the other hand the ball is

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
smack into the other hand the ball is
thrown<00:01:17.009> across<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.610> almost<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.210> downwards

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
thrown across is almost going downwards

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.149 
thrown across is almost going downwards
if<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.380> downwards<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.830> least<00:01:19.950> very

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
if not downwards at least very

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.230 
if not downwards at least very
horizontally<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> be

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
horizontally you don't want to be

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
horizontally you don't want to be
tossing<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.659> upwards<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.680> make<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
tossing it upwards that will make you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.410 
tossing it upwards that will make you
lose<00:01:23.130> power<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.759> pattern<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.150> move<00:01:24.270> too

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
lose power the pattern will move too

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this is bad if you want to go down so
