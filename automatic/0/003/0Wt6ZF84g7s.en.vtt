00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
absolutely adorable but this was the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
absolutely adorable but this was the
first<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.189> wanted<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.759> definitely

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
first thing I wanted to get definitely

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.320 
first thing I wanted to get definitely
so<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> again<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:44.040> sofa<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.670> pullout<00:01:45.000> bed

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
so this again is a sofa and pullout bed

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.300 
so this again is a sofa and pullout bed
and<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.960> $10<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.130> very

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
it out it's really simple to do and let

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.930 
it out it's really simple to do and let
me<00:04:52.340> get<00:04:52.520> kid<00:04:52.789> again

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.879 

so<00:04:58.940> she<00:04:59.000> ever<00:04:59.389> had<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.900> sleepover<00:05:00.349> with<00:05:00.650> some

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
so she ever had a sleepover with some

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.969 
so she ever had a sleepover with some
friends<00:05:02.289> yeah<00:05:03.289> we<00:05:03.530> should<00:05:03.620> probably<00:05:03.650> put<00:05:03.919> a

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
friends yeah we should probably put a

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:14.290 
friends yeah we should probably put a
pillow<00:05:04.220> back<00:05:04.460> there<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:13.820> I<00:05:13.849> don't<00:05:13.970> only<00:05:14.180> think

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
pillow back there so I don't only think

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.719 
pillow back there so I don't only think
this<00:05:14.570> would<00:05:14.720> work<00:05:14.870> if<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.289> hire<00:05:15.470> like<00:05:15.740> this

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
this would work if you hire like this

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.810 
this would work if you hire like this
her<00:05:16.970> legs<00:05:17.240> will<00:05:17.449> die<00:05:17.570> totally<00:05:18.139> go<00:05:18.289> off<00:05:18.820> just

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
her legs will die totally go off just

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.409 
her legs will die totally go off just
show<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.150> guys<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:22.220> her<00:05:22.460> legs<00:05:22.580> do<00:05:22.880> go<00:05:23.060> off<00:05:23.210> if

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
show you guys so her legs do go off if

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.810 
show you guys so her legs do go off if
you<00:05:23.539> don't<00:05:23.750> like<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.169> but<00:05:24.979> I<00:05:25.220> still<00:05:25.520> think

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
you don't like that but I still think

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.990 
you don't like that but I still think
