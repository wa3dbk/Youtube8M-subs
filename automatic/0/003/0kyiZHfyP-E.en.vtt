00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
these boxes turn out like one of the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.660 
these boxes turn out like one of the
videos<00:03:44.250> i<00:03:44.430> saw<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:46.410> past<00:03:46.890> month<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.400> think<00:03:47.430> it

the volume you got to go through a whole
bunch<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:12.260> skunks<00:04:13.260> before<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.770> get<00:04:13.920> that

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
see doing this technique you can really

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:58.760 
see doing this technique you can really
kind<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.430> fly<00:04:26.610> through<00:04:26.880> these<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> lot<00:04:27.480> quicker

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770

Kennedy that's why we look at every once
in<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:39.849> while<00:05:39.970> there's<00:05:40.210> an<00:05:40.300> oddball<00:05:40.449> like<00:05:40.900> that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.640

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.720 
you have to look at that with a
magnifying<00:06:47.710> glass<00:06:47.949> that<00:06:48.280> almost<00:06:48.460> looks<00:06:48.699> like

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
magnifying glass that almost looks like

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.200 
magnifying glass that almost looks like
a<00:06:48.880> that's<00:06:49.000> proof<00:06:50.610> well<00:06:51.610> there's<00:06:51.760> another<00:06:51.910> one

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
a that's proof well there's another one

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.510 
a that's proof well there's another one
right<00:06:52.240> next<00:06:52.480> to<00:06:52.660> it<00:06:52.720> so<00:06:52.960> you<00:06:52.990> compare<00:06:53.520> that's

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
right next to it so you compare that's

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.990 
right next to it so you compare that's
definitely<00:06:54.790> approved<00:06:59.130> so<00:07:00.130> we<00:07:00.250> got<00:07:00.400> a<00:07:00.430> gold<00:07:00.729> and

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
definitely approved so we got a gold and

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.280 
definitely approved so we got a gold and
we<00:07:01.060> got<00:07:01.180> a<00:07:01.210> as<00:07:01.900> proof<00:07:02.260> so<00:07:02.470> far<00:07:02.710> it's<00:07:03.310> not<00:07:03.460> bad

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
we got a as proof so far it's not bad

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.330 
we got a as proof so far it's not bad
tell<00:07:05.290> you<00:07:05.380> what<00:07:05.530> we'll<00:07:05.650> take<00:07:05.860> a<00:07:05.889> break<00:07:06.130> we'll

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
tell you what we'll take a break we'll

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.530 
tell you what we'll take a break we'll
get<00:07:06.490> back<00:07:06.610> to<00:07:06.790> you<00:07:06.850> okay<00:07:08.910> youtubers<00:07:09.910> we

decided we didn't find anything else of

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.580 
decided we didn't find anything else of
interest<00:07:13.360> that<00:07:13.630> you<00:07:13.720> didn't<00:07:14.050> see<00:07:14.199> on<00:07:14.229> the

interest that you didn't see on the

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.020 
interest that you didn't see on the
video<00:07:15.580> while<00:07:15.850> we<00:07:16.000> were<00:07:16.090> doing<00:07:16.240> it<00:07:16.540> and<00:07:17.880> once<00:07:18.880> we

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030

video while we were doing it and once we
got<00:07:19.120> done<00:07:19.389> we<00:07:19.840> took<00:07:20.320> another<00:07:20.590> look<00:07:20.940> this<00:07:21.940> is

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
got done we took another look this is

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.280 
got done we took another look this is
definitely<00:07:22.750> a<00:07:23.310> Bicentennial<00:07:24.310> s<00:07:24.660> proof<00:07:25.660> in

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
definitely a Bicentennial s proof in

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.180 
definitely a Bicentennial s proof in
beautiful<00:07:26.950> shape<00:07:27.090> really<00:07:28.090> shiny<00:07:28.680> the<00:07:29.680> back<00:07:29.919> is

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
beautiful you can see the reflection and

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.029 
beautiful you can see the reflection and
then<00:07:35.110> we<00:07:35.530> also<00:07:35.680> found<00:07:36.070> this<00:07:36.330> 1999<00:07:37.330> d<00:07:38.039> that

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
then we also found this 1999 d that

somebody went to the trouble of gold

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.550 
somebody went to the trouble of gold
plating<00:07:41.760> again<00:07:42.760> it's<00:07:43.450> a<00:07:43.510> little<00:07:43.690> hard<00:07:43.840> to<00:07:43.960> film

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
plating again it's a little hard to film

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.580 
plating again it's a little hard to film
because<00:07:45.039> it's<00:07:45.910> shiny<00:07:46.330> you<00:07:46.780> know<00:07:46.900> the<00:07:47.169> gold<00:07:47.350> the

because it's shiny you know the gold the
gold<00:07:47.620> surface<00:07:48.039> has<00:07:48.460> made<00:07:48.669> it<00:07:48.820> a<00:07:48.970> little<00:07:49.150> bit

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
gold surface has made it a little bit

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.440 
gold surface has made it a little bit
reflective<00:07:49.870> so<00:07:50.800> we<00:07:51.550> didn't<00:07:51.760> find<00:07:51.940> any<00:07:52.150> silver

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:52.450 
reflective so we didn't find any silver

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.650 
reflective so we didn't find any silver
silver<00:07:53.130> junk<00:07:54.130> silver<00:07:54.370> if<00:07:55.030> you<00:07:55.210> will<00:07:55.360> but<00:07:55.539> we
