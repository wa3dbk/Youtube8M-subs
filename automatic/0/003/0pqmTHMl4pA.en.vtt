00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.640
 today we will learn how to assemble a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.929
 sci-fi and role-playing game for 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.460
 the console station 1 of 1998 and what 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.110
 we completely unload the outside 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 to download it we are the five 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160
 parts exp the links to download the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.610
 game will be the expression of the video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 I uploaded it to mega and each file weight 150 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.900
 mb 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.939
 except for the last one that weighs 137 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.070
 once loaded the five parts 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.020
 we click right to extract here and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.050
 is going to extract this folder that 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.840
 contains disk 1 and disk 2 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.670
 once central and with 1 will be the game 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 together with three image files 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.250
 it's like the game character like in the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.250
 disk and like the back 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.400
 in the same liquor 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.650
 how does the game look like and take the disc 2 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.560
 to run the game to play it 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.120
 we are in the psc 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.360
 we need this specific emulator 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.250
 because if we use other simulators it 's the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.980
 kinematics of the game does not go them 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.750
 produce altered sources well 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.640
 so I need to use this emulator in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.200
 specific if you do not understand this emulator 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 you can download it in X in this 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.310
 video to start the game we are going to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.280
 analyze chivos lq paris or look for the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.460
 I play the disc 1 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.260
 we click on the image only 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.260
 we wait for it to start 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.420
 how to come 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.420
 then it is in Spanish 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.270
 and well this is all often those of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.460
 this new to start the game or others 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.580
 to continue if this agreement if it is 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.190
 recorded and the other one that is the audio 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.970
 does not have much good figuration that 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.550
 It has been all for today 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.890
 it's like downloading the game on the discs 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.890
 in Spanish and I say goodbye to God
