00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.850
 three pieces had to be brought to the first round for a performance 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.619
 by Bach another of him and the romance of Joseph Joachim 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.039
 the pianist Ben Sherman praises one of the piano accompanists at the competition 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.329
 we no longer tell these pieces to us 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.689
 the competitors have to play three different pieces on the first round 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.440
 play 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.269
 to play something of Bach 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.420
 something of this idea and then the obligatory piece 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.030
 the Joachim romance 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.539
 each of these pieces demand something different from the competitor broke 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.930
 i wanted this shot the roofsticks are standard pieces the 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.640
 every violinist learns 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.610
 However, in many ways they are very difficult to play 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.620
 Being able to play counterpoint so several melodic lines at the same time 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.280
 If your life is more unusual you can work faster if you clean 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.380
 you can also intone or play with a nice tone 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.520
 Quickly hear if they understand the music because they are soul-playing it 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.050
 is very important that the violinist understands that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.080
 he says that the music is extremely logical, but on the other hand they have to 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.080
 play individually so they do not sound like any other 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.810
 the movie project the Wall Street 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 2 Mio a move of the musical Spamalot reminded Koch 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.880
 From her flock, the show has known the ministry in the Way to a Big Brother 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 I tell them 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 when the man was that her technical heaviest 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.460
 the notes are very heavy the violin goes up and down the harmonies 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.780
 very compact she is only in the music is a great passion 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.430
 So here's a possibility for the violinist of his imagination 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.150
 and to showcase his passion 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.570
 New York went 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.770
 she says to him 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.290
 Specialists by Sandro Pira piece by Joachim is a table addition 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.820
 Achieving achievements, however, is a challenge 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.630
 as if it is something so simple with such a 1 percent 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.220
 the right-wing extremists 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.980
 with us it is a simple normal and thereby justified to one is not allowed 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.340
 to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.170
 But many did not do too little Elise therefore I believe that the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.650
 Combination of these three pieces has the selection criteria is game study over 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.739
 he should get me statements really satisfied 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.749
 she finally got the weather with us 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.119
 sho judgment was there after that 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.150
 We are almost at the end of it again 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.030
 but not quite yet because we have the artistic director of the competition 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.810
 Professor Christoph Penzlin caught immediately after the end of the first round and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.119
 which offer him a small short summary 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.719
 that's wonderful 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.329
 there are several 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.929
 the water is in itself 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 it's great fun 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.329
 I already have one 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.919

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.679
 So we are tenants 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.829

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.159
