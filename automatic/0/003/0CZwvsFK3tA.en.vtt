00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 friend of minecraft again here with 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.649
 another tutorial this time this tutorial is 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.200
 a secret door personally guys 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.429
 Personally, I really liked the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 I truly believe that this is one of the best 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.299
 secret doors that I've seen and good 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400
 Come on, I'll teach it and then I'll say it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.650
 how to do it to an example if we stop 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.109
 At the door and we stop, nothing happens 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.500
 it opens us the same in this nothing happens or 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.779
 what the hell watford hey then how 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.269
 is that it opens up good if we pay in 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.700
 this observe how it is that this and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.010
 99 put nothing just hit me here 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.690
 and the door opens or that is how nice 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.070
 see guys awesome good then 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 Now I will tell you how it is that I have done it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.040
 I'm going to make a space here here 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.940
 it goes well the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 put as a step 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.320
 and I'm going to occupy what are rails I'm going 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.989
 to climb the step and go 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.150
 I'm going to put a block here a block 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.270
 here and a block here and obviously 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.550
 after using rails 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.470
 I'm going to use a trolley 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.810
 that the rails but before using this 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.130
 wagon in the second in the second what 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.080
 we are going to break and we are going to change it 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.120
 a pressure dish though guys and 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.770
 we put the trolley here 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.660
 here I do not know what the hell has happened but 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.980
 it has gone down and it did not have to 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.310
 spend that so then let's put 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.310
 two blocks 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.500
 and if that was when perfect blocks there are 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.439
 that put two blocks so that it does not 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.690
 drop the wagon and good at the time of 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.770
 that we let me put the chest 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.049
 so you can see how it is here 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.329
 remember that I had put a wall 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.310
 so good at the moment we approach 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.950
 to this shore the wagon goes to 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.710
 I'm going to break up so they can see me 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.990
 approach and up and that bit that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.670
 bit that makes that little boy climb 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.670
 little bit will not throw energy 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.409
 but here in this block and we're going to 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.500
 get out here the energy that guys for 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.409
 say that we are going to take it out observe how 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 pull and well let's go to the next thing that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.560
 they are the pistons 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.870
 we are going to put pistons and what is the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.000
 door 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.159
 we're going to do as a framework of also 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.600
 here so it looks like there are two doors 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.060
 and see what is the good 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.620
 and well I think it was like that let's leave 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.300
 laces and I think if we stay 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 short and I left him here we say four 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.700
 of difference I do not know why 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.130
 good the lawyer blocks equal difference 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.750
 that here so that the trap remains the same 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.750
 let's put the pistons one more place 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.770
 ok so let's count two boxes of 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.790
 12 difference and we put the piston 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.969
 perfect now yes 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.550
 Now other guys now here it 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.260
 I'm going to cover 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.240
 this also has to be had 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.130
 covered and obviously this is where 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.260
 it's going to be the door 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.160
 today breaking now I keep explaining 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.160
 how the circuit guys 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.579
 although I do not think he has put 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.959
 well there but good and I miss him more 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.209
 block does not matter who you leave your 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.709
 difference picture you are going to say good 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.060
 and as face more is that there are 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.700
 open pistons let's do the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.959
 reverse polarity circuit very easy 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.329
 very easy guys is like the trap 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.859
 last I've taught we put a repeat of 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.340
 here and an upstairs for what happens 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.989
 energy let's put a block here not 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.579
 it's far away and we're going to pass it on 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.939
 energy obviously are already on 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.359
 the pistons and a door appears and for 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.359
 back here 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.810
 back here we are going to put but eye me 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.700
 here I put repeaters to give us 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.659
 time to get into the force and every 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.659
 who puts the time he wants 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.320
 and you're ready guys that's all this is all 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.240
 the circuit is already covered so that 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560
 the look that does not want to come 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.380
 like our trap door 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.310
 secret and good etc etc let's go to 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.300
 see if it works he pushed it and perfect very 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.800
 well I missed a bit of 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.980
 repeaters so it does not lock up so 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.900
 fast good guys very pretty cheat the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.030
 very beautiful truth, I am fascinated and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.430
 I have to teach you guys what's good 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.980
 this thanks to those who follow me 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.720
 supporting and those who want them to 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.430
 give away my map I've said how 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.310
 put on watch a radio channel video there 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.510
 I said how and who does not know because I already 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.220
 add by facebook and there you 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.080
 I explain that guys thank you I remember 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.250
 military mx area of ​​mx see you in the 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.250
 next see you later
