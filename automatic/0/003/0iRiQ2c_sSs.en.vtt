we<00:03:38.340> take<00:03:38.520> our<00:03:38.670> pieces<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.350> ear<00:03:40.350> we've<00:03:40.770> cut<00:03:41.010> into

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
we take our pieces of ear we've cut into

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.240 
we take our pieces of ear we've cut into
more<00:03:42.090> manageable<00:03:42.570> size<00:03:42.600> strips<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:44.160> we're

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
more manageable size strips and we're

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.880 
more manageable size strips and we're
just<00:03:44.340> going<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.580> layer<00:03:44.700> them<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:46.770> that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
just going to layer them in so that

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.800 
just going to layer them in so that
they're<00:03:47.100> kind<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.060> even<00:03:50.600> once<00:03:51.600> we've<00:03:51.810> got

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
they're kind of even once we've got

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.680 
they're kind of even once we've got
about<00:03:54.810> two<00:03:55.110> layers<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.740> ear<00:03:56.670> we're<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.630> to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
about two layers of ear we're going to

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.410 
about two layers of ear we're going to
go<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.050> use<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:59.430> liquid<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.970> cooking

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
go and use that liquid that cooking

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.020 
go and use that liquid that cooking
liquid<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.020> had<00:04:01.140> reduced<00:04:01.380> earlier<00:04:02.030> this

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
liquid that I had reduced earlier this

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.120 
liquid that I had reduced earlier this
liquid<00:04:03.330> is<00:04:03.450> full<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.230> gelatin<00:04:04.950> that's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
liquid is full of the gelatin that's

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.010 
liquid is full of the gelatin that's
been<00:04:05.280> broken<00:04:05.610> down<00:04:05.760> from<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.690> cooking

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
been broken down from the cooking

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.560 
been broken down from the cooking
process<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.830> we're<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.640> pour<00:04:09.540> a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
process and we're just going to pour a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.760 
process and we're just going to pour a
little<00:04:09.780> bit<00:04:09.960> over<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:11.130> kind<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.370> cover<00:04:12.770> that

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
little bit over to kind of cover that

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.830 
little bit over to kind of cover that
first<00:04:14.040> couple<00:04:14.340> layers<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.610> ear<00:04:14.850> okay<00:04:15.600> and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
first couple layers of ear okay and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.590 
first couple layers of ear okay and
we're<00:04:16.020> do<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.290> in<00:04:16.530> steps<00:04:17.489> some<00:04:18.090> ear<00:04:18.330> more

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
we're do this in steps some ear more

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.240 
we're do this in steps some ear more
liquid<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.590> until<00:04:19.919> this<00:04:20.040> thing<00:04:20.220> is

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
liquid and so on until this thing is

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.510 
liquid and so on until this thing is
completely<00:04:20.970> full<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:22.530> cooking<00:04:23.160> liquid<00:04:23.250> of

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
completely full the cooking liquid of

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.900 
completely full the cooking liquid of
course<00:04:23.820> will<00:04:24.150> once<00:04:24.570> we<00:04:25.500> get<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.890> terrine<00:04:26.490> cold

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
course will once we get the terrine cold

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.020 
course will once we get the terrine cold
will<00:04:27.510> become<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.680> sort<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.070> gelatin<00:04:29.550> binder

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
will become the sort of gelatin binder

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.480 
will become the sort of gelatin binder
for<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.270> whole<00:04:30.390> thing

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.520 

now<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.480> we've<00:04:39.570> got<00:04:39.690> all<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.900> year<00:04:40.110> nice

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
now that we've got all the year nice

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.340 
now that we've got all the year nice
layered<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.730> there<00:04:41.970> I'm<00:04:42.870> just<00:04:43.140> going<00:04:43.290> to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
layered in there I'm just going to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.570 
layered in there I'm just going to
finish<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.650> off<00:04:43.830> with<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.070> little<00:04:44.280> bit<00:04:44.370> more

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
finish it off with a little bit more

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.460 
finish it off with a little bit more
cooking<00:04:45.120> liquid<00:04:45.450> just<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.870> sort<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.110> fill<00:04:46.350> in

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
cooking liquid just to sort of fill in

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.200 
cooking liquid just to sort of fill in
the<00:04:46.500> gaps<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.250> remember<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:47.880> is<00:04:48.090> our

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
the gaps and remember this is our

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.620 
the gaps and remember this is our
gelatin<00:04:49.140> binder<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.920> also<00:04:50.430> an<00:04:50.940> important

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
gelatin binder and also an important

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.090 
gelatin binder and also an important
part<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.350> flavor<00:04:53.480> impact<00:04:54.480> of<00:04:54.630> this<00:04:54.780> drain

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
part of the flavor impact of this drain

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.670 
part of the flavor impact of this drain
okay<00:04:56.100> now<00:04:56.670> we<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.420> wrap<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.930> sort<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.530> like

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
okay now we get to wrap it sort of like

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.280 
okay now we get to wrap it sort of like
a<00:04:58.710> present<00:04:59.360> or<00:05:00.360> take<00:05:00.920> this<00:05:01.920> sort<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.220> excess<00:05:03.290> on

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
a present or take this sort of excess on

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:13.189 
a present or take this sort of excess on
all<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.770> sides<00:05:05.990> pull<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.140> all<00:05:07.260> in

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.830 

like<00:05:13.770> so

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
like so

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.960 
like so
and<00:05:16.020> apply<00:05:17.010> it<00:05:17.070> just<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.520> little<00:05:17.670> bit<00:05:17.880> of

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
and apply it just a little bit of

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.580 
and apply it just a little bit of
pressure<00:05:19.580> so<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.940> liquid<00:05:21.870> can<00:05:22.290> really

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
pressure so that the liquid can really

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.080 
pressure so that the liquid can really
fill<00:05:22.950> in<00:05:23.070> all<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:24.230> gaps<00:05:25.639> and<00:05:26.639> also<00:05:26.850> give<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.060> a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
fill in all the gaps and also give you a

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.230 
fill in all the gaps and also give you a
nice<00:05:27.330> tightly<00:05:28.110> formed<00:05:28.530> terrine<00:05:28.980> finally<00:05:29.910> you

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
nice tightly formed terrine finally you

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.350 
nice tightly formed terrine finally you
want<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.510> give<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.780> little<00:05:30.960> tap<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.490> again

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
want to give it a little tap just again

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.300 
want to give it a little tap just again
maybe<00:05:33.600> loosen<00:05:34.530> some<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.770> those<00:05:34.830> trapped<00:05:35.100> air

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
maybe loosen some of those trapped air

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.620 
maybe loosen some of those trapped air
bubbles<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:37.280> one<00:05:38.280> more<00:05:38.490> push<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:41.630> I've

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
bubbles and one more push and I've

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.230 
bubbles and one more push and I've
constructed<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.610> little<00:05:44.610> arts<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:44.940> crafts

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
constructed a little arts and crafts

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.460 
constructed a little arts and crafts
project<00:05:45.630> this<00:05:45.780> is<00:05:45.960> just<00:05:46.139> a<00:05:46.230> piece<00:05:46.440> of
