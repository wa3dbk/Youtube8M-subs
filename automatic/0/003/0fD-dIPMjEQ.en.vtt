of it wouldn't happen to know if that's

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.680 
of it wouldn't happen to know if that's
by<00:01:25.229> design<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.860> you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
by design would you

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.420 
by design would you
I'm<00:01:28.690> pretty<00:01:28.960> sure<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.260> is<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.590> now<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.340> we're

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
I'm pretty sure it is but now that we're

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.910 
I'm pretty sure it is but now that we're
back<00:01:30.460> at<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:30.760> second<00:01:31.150> floor<00:01:31.240> whoa<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.830> was

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
back at the second floor whoa that was

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.850 
back at the second floor whoa that was
fast<00:01:33.100> first<00:01:33.880> thing<00:01:34.120> we<00:01:34.240> need<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.390> do<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:35.110> go

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
fast first thing we need to do is go

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.400 
fast first thing we need to do is go
back<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.850> super<00:01:37.240> collide<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.140> where

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
back to the super collide what the where

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.440 
back to the super collide what the where
the<00:01:38.560> super<00:01:38.800> hauling<00:01:39.190> superconductor<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.030> but

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the super hauling superconductor is but

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.760 
the super hauling superconductor is but
first<00:01:41.520> throw<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.550> few<00:01:43.300> have<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:44.350> have<00:01:44.560> to

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
first throw a few have you have to

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.480 
first throw a few have you have to
reactivate<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:46.240> proper<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.530> whatcha<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:49.020> yep

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
reactivate the proper so whatcha is yep

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.550 
reactivate the proper so whatcha is yep
which<00:01:51.490> basically<00:01:51.700> involves<00:01:52.420> either<00:01:52.960> checking

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
which basically involves either checking

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.200 
which basically involves either checking
if<00:01:53.860> it's<00:01:54.010> blue<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.580> go<00:01:54.700> back<00:01:54.820> here

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
if it's blue you have to go back here

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.840 
if it's blue you have to go back here
and<00:01:55.810> blow<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.140> up<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.620> if<00:01:57.040> it's<00:01:57.190> red<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.490> have

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and blow it up or if it's red you have

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.080 
and blow it up or if it's red you have
to<00:01:57.970> go<00:01:58.090> over<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.870> here<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.380> set<00:01:59.530> another<00:01:59.620> bomb

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
to go over to here and set another bomb

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.350 
to go over to here and set another bomb
