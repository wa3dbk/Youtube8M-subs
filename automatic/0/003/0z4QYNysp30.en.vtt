00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.710
 hello dear chess friends sincerely 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.510
 welcome to our little last 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.820
 We will do some tasks in this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.000
 Take a look at the king 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.029
 prepare diploma 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 We will begin with the openings 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.900
 we'll take a look at the Italian today 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.600
 partie to a so-called open lot 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.779
 that means it comes in the center to 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 clash 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:35.560
 who only build up the Italian lot 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.600
 she starts with white from e24 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.699
 black 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.699
 pulls from help to e5 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.730
 conclusion in springer threatened by g1 on f3 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:54.260
 with the farmer on e5 and black away 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.460
 the farmers with jumpers from b 8 to c6 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 The ball has to be covered white 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:09.060
 now bring his runner from f1 to c4 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.250
 the position on the weak farmers 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.250
 to look at 11 7 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.090
 black takes the runner on c5 from 11 8 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 does exactly the same on the weak 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.530
 farmers on f2 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.950
 Now we come to ours 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.560
 first task now sees the farmers 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.829
 from c2 c3 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.680
 I ask you now why is this one ? 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.329
 meaningful train 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.659
 please pause right now comes the 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.659
 answer 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.890
 so now to the answer now if black 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.750
 for example, now the springer here 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.010
 has moved from g 8 to 11 6 has the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 possibility here the farmers of g2 up 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.160
 to pull the four and has this train 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.760
 On the one hand, here is the prepared 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.070
 runners at risk and had on the other 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.040
 even to the farmers that means even if it is 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.920
 black is coming here now 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.900
 Under zugzwang looks for example 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.900
 put him back 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.140
 and white can continue to evolve 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.330
 Here is a clear excess in the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.610
 center therefore a very useful too 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:46.410
 at this moment and we look 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.410
 ever to the next task 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.989
 so here we need the lot out of it 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.989
 the game is the same again 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.810
 so let's say we can pick it up 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.420
 just so do everything here so far 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.080
 just now we have the den 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.540
 farmers purchased from c2 to c3 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.800
 Now my question is what if now 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.320
 instead, the runner of C4 the farmers 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.580
 actually hits f1 and thus the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.810
 King Chess offers what is of this 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.390
 train 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.690
 please pause right now comes the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.690
 answer 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.540
 so now the runner answers 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.710
 offers the king chess that is 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.380
 Last there are the following 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.570
 possibilities because there is no cover 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.160
 that I can act in the dirt the field 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.770
 the queen again at 18 or at 7 what 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.510
 however very ineffective is the last end 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.470
 it will boil down to that 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.230
 King Knows Advantage White 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.870
 is that the cockade with this no more 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.700
 is possible in this lot 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.740
 However, it is also under a very 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.710
 high price has been bought 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:35.250
 after all , white has a farmer against 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.020
 A runner exchanged last end 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.730
 not really effective 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.390
 black has here but now 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:48.600
 clear excess still by the ex 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.600
 Thiele runs on rc5 in the center 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.790
 when the player comes to notice 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.250
 you have that on your own figure 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.600
 every case white is missing now 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.600
 certainly not useful 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.530
 so and that are already with ours 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.750
 first lesson came to an end 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.730
 We will be in the next lesson 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.040
 the French part is a half-open one 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.280
 watch a lot and I have there too 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:19.100
 some tasks for you i'm glad 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.100
 to welcome you again until then
