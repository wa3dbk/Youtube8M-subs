essentially this one is and we had the
idea<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.399> we<00:01:11.610> placed<00:01:11.909> our<00:01:12.180> building<00:01:12.659> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
idea what if we placed our building in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
idea what if we placed our building in
our<00:01:12.960> restaurant<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> edge<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.670> this

our restaurant right on the edge of this
detention<00:01:15.630> pond<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.410> then<00:01:16.979> escaped<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.020> sure

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
detention pond and then escaped it sure

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
detention pond and then escaped it sure
when<00:01:19.289> it's<00:01:19.440> raining<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:19.920> people<00:01:20.160> don't<00:01:20.369> want

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
when it's raining well people don't want

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.840 
when it's raining well people don't want
to<00:01:20.550> be<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:20.940> anyways<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.539> it<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.200> flood

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
to be out here anyways and it will flood

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.029 
to be out here anyways and it will flood
but<00:01:23.850> most<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> time<00:01:24.840> Southern<00:01:25.470> California

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
but most of the time Southern California

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.219 
but most of the time Southern California
we<00:01:26.160> can<00:01:26.310> actually<00:01:26.460> use<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.050> that's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
we can actually use it and so that's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.529 
we can actually use it and so that's
what<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.470> do

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
what we do

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.620 
what we do
sustainability<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:31.490> environmental

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
sustainability and environmental

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.029 
sustainability and environmental
friendliness<00:01:33.630> frankly<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.800> part

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
friendliness frankly it's just it's part

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.680 
friendliness frankly it's just it's part
of<00:01:35.100> our<00:01:35.220> basic<00:01:35.399> ethos<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.149> think<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.509> is

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
of our basic ethos I think this is

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.210 
of our basic ethos I think this is
really<00:01:36.960> quite<00:01:37.289> common<00:01:37.649> actually<00:01:37.770> amongst

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
really quite common actually amongst

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520 
really quite common actually amongst
small<00:01:38.910> Brewers<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.380> an

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
example as best we can this combo right

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.969 
example as best we can this combo right
here<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.210> interestingly<00:01:45.210> enough

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
here is actually interestingly enough

they polish it for the headstone
material<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.599> see<00:02:03.660> flaws<00:02:04.140> or

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
characteristics they don't like and they

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.380 
characteristics they don't like and they
they<00:02:06.509> toss<00:02:06.929> it<00:02:07.140> aside<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:08.130> often<00:02:09.000> called<00:02:09.209> the

they toss it aside I often called the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
they toss it aside I often called the
gardens<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> island<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.530> misfit<00:02:10.739> trees

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
gardens here the island of misfit trees

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.740 
gardens here the island of misfit trees
because<00:02:12.319> most<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.440> these<00:02:13.560> trees<00:02:13.860> were<00:02:14.750> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
because most of these trees were and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.559 
because most of these trees were and
also<00:02:16.410> again<00:02:16.709> rejects<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.000> go<00:02:18.209> through<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
also again rejects and I go through and

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.420 
also again rejects and I go through and
I<00:02:18.660> select<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.319> oddballs<00:02:19.620> because<00:02:20.250> what

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
I select all these oddballs because what

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.059 
I select all these oddballs because what
I<00:02:20.459> wanted<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.660> natural<00:02:22.530> feeling<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.010> of

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
I wanted was a natural feeling and of

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.040 
I wanted was a natural feeling and of
course<00:02:23.310> nature<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.239> doesn't<00:02:24.569> make<00:02:24.720> these

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
course nature just doesn't make these

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.780 
course nature just doesn't make these
what<00:02:25.560> they<00:02:25.650> call<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.920> standard<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.489> know<00:02:26.610> the

canopy nature goes all
way<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:32.099> wanted<00:02:32.400> these<00:02:32.580> gardens<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
way and I wanted these gardens to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.170 
way and I wanted these gardens to
reflect<00:02:33.390> mother<00:02:34.019> nature<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.879> haven't

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
reflect mother nature so we haven't

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.170 
reflect mother nature so we haven't
really<00:02:36.299> manicured<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:38.099> have<00:02:38.310> some<00:02:38.610> groupings

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
really manicured we have some groupings

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.330 
really manicured we have some groupings
and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.480> have<00:02:39.599> some<00:02:39.780> different<00:02:40.140> themes<00:02:40.440> but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and I have some different themes but

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.119 
and I have some different themes but
it's<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:42.180> lot<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.959> really<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.890> allows

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
it's a lot of a really that allows

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's a lot of a really that allows
Mother<00:02:44.400> Nature<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.819> express<00:02:45.150> herself<00:02:47.629> all<00:02:48.629> of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.010 

this<00:03:35.840> was<00:03:36.110> designed<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:37.360> various<00:03:38.360> themes<00:03:38.690> here

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
this was designed as various themes here

this was designed as various themes here
in<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.230> garden<00:03:39.530> we<00:03:39.680> have<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:39.920> riparian

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
in the garden we have the riparian

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.950 
in the garden we have the riparian
habitat<00:03:40.970> through<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.330> middle<00:03:41.630> with<00:03:41.780> the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
habitat through the middle with the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.290 
habitat through the middle with the
stream<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.770> essentially

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
stream and that is essentially

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.920 
stream and that is essentially
recirculated<00:03:44.300> in<00:03:44.390> stormwater<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:47.150> we<00:03:47.750> don't

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
recirculated in stormwater so we don't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.200 
recirculated in stormwater so we don't
have<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.440> fill<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.830> other<00:03:49.130> than<00:03:49.460> maybe

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
have to fill this other than maybe

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.240 
have to fill this other than maybe
adding<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.810> little<00:03:51.050> bit<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.350> water<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:51.740> during

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
adding a little bit of water just during

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.680 
adding a little bit of water just during
the<00:03:52.370> middle<00:03:52.610> of<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.790> summer<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.180> keep<00:03:53.240> some

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the middle of the summer to keep some

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.430 
the middle of the summer to keep some
water<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:55.300> provides<00:03:56.300> water<00:03:56.630> behind<00:03:57.260> me

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
water in this provides water behind me

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.810 
water in this provides water behind me
is<00:03:57.820> about<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:58.970> foot<00:03:59.300> thick<00:03:59.510> table<00:03:59.960> it's<00:04:00.170> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
is about a foot thick table it's the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.340 
is about a foot thick table it's the
coffee<00:04:01.820> table<00:04:02.210> I<00:04:02.300> call<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.660> 10,000<00:04:03.170> pound

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
coffee table I call it the 10,000 pound

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.730 
coffee table I call it the 10,000 pound
coffee<00:04:03.590> table<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:06.050> another<00:04:06.260> use<00:04:06.470> for<00:04:06.500> it

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.370 
coffee table so it's another use for it
now<00:04:07.190> these<00:04:07.310> are<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.640> sliced<00:04:08.150> pieces<00:04:08.480> there's

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
now these are the sliced pieces there's

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.240 
now these are the sliced pieces there's
other<00:04:09.620> slice<00:04:09.980> pieces<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.930> think<00:04:12.260> these

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
other slice pieces if you think these

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.130 
other slice pieces if you think these
pieces<00:04:13.520> almost<00:04:14.420> like<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.690> loaf<00:04:14.960> of<00:04:15.080> bread

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
pieces almost like a loaf of bread

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.220 
pieces almost like a loaf of bread
there's<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.010> heel<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:17.209> Corie<00:04:17.720> terms<00:04:17.989> I've

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
there's the heel and in Corie terms I've

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.800 
there's the heel and in Corie terms I've
learned<00:04:18.440> that's<00:04:18.620> called<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.980> rough<00:04:19.220> back<00:04:19.810> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
learned that's called a rough back and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.630 
learned that's called a rough back and
then<00:04:20.959> there's<00:04:21.170> an<00:04:21.320> interior<00:04:21.680> slices<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:22.490> this

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
then there's an interior slices so this

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.130 
then there's an interior slices so this
is<00:04:22.790> an<00:04:22.910> interior<00:04:23.150> slice<00:04:23.480> of<00:04:23.630> bread<00:04:23.690> right<00:04:23.990> it's

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
is an interior slice of bread right it's

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.500 
is an interior slice of bread right it's
got<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> crust<00:04:24.620> on<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:25.370> it's<00:04:25.520> uh<00:04:25.730> smooth

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
got the crust on it but it's uh smooth

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.390 
got the crust on it but it's uh smooth
on<00:04:26.660> both<00:04:26.810> sides<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.010> big<00:04:28.160> coffee

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
on both sides just like the big coffee

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400 
on both sides just like the big coffee

you some pieces that are equivalent of
the<00:04:32.390> crusts<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:34.510> was<00:04:35.510> talking<00:04:36.110> about<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.500> rough

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
the crusts I was talking about the rough

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.550 
the crusts I was talking about the rough
backs<00:04:37.070> or<00:04:37.430> like<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.510> heels<00:04:38.840> on<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.260> loaf<00:04:39.440> of

bread here's a couple of examples
clearly<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.170> can<00:04:42.380> see<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.830> quarry<00:04:43.370> marks

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
clearly you can see the quarry marks

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.100 
clearly you can see the quarry marks
he's<00:04:43.820> milling<00:04:44.150> marks<00:04:44.300> on<00:04:44.540> them<00:04:44.690> they<00:04:44.840> quarry

he's milling marks on them they quarry
again<00:04:45.950> this<00:04:46.160> stuff<00:04:46.310> is<00:04:46.550> just<00:04:46.580> scattered

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
again this stuff is just scattered

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.120 
again this stuff is just scattered
around<00:04:47.390> at<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.050> quarry<00:04:48.320> site<00:04:48.590> they<00:04:48.980> don't

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
around at the quarry site they don't

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.400 
around at the quarry site they don't
really<00:04:49.310> use<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.640> for<00:04:49.760> anything<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.510> this<00:04:51.350> is

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
really use it for anything and this is

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.380 
really use it for anything and this is
another<00:04:51.740> rough<00:04:52.010> pack<00:04:52.220> totally<00:04:52.970> about<00:04:53.120> this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
another rough pack totally about this

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.810 
another rough pack totally about this
deep<00:04:53.600> and<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:53.930> got<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.140> smooth<00:04:55.070> surface<00:04:55.700> on

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
deep and it's got a smooth surface on

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.940 
deep and it's got a smooth surface on
the<00:04:55.970> other<00:04:56.090> side<00:04:56.360> from<00:04:56.510> what<00:04:56.630> we'll<00:04:56.810> slice<00:04:57.050> so

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
the other side from what we'll slice so

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.170 
the other side from what we'll slice so
I<00:04:58.250> use<00:04:59.120> these<00:04:59.330> retaining

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
I use these retaining

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.630 
I use these retaining
hey<00:05:01.690> personally<00:05:02.290> I<00:05:02.320> think<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.950> is<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.160> little

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
hey personally I think this is a little

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.590 
hey personally I think this is a little
bit<00:05:03.730> better<00:05:03.880> looking<00:05:04.240> than<00:05:04.390> those

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
bit better looking than those

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.530 
bit better looking than those
interlocking<00:05:05.560> kind<00:05:06.130> of<00:05:06.220> wall<00:05:06.430> stacking<00:05:07.000> you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
interlocking kind of wall stacking you

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.990 
interlocking kind of wall stacking you
know<00:05:07.660> concrete<00:05:08.050> things<00:05:08.530> they<00:05:08.890> use<00:05:09.100> those

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
know concrete things they use those

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.200 
know concrete things they use those
there<00:05:10.180> all<00:05:10.300> right<00:05:10.480> but<00:05:10.690> this<00:05:11.620> seems<00:05:11.860> like<00:05:11.920> a

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
there all right but this seems like a

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.990 
there all right but this seems like a
way<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.270> use<00:05:13.510> some<00:05:13.750> reject<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.830> know<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:15.880> know

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
way to use some reject you know you know

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.450 
way to use some reject you know you know
repurpose<00:05:16.570> material<00:05:17.110> if<00:05:17.230> you<00:05:17.350> will<00:05:17.530> it's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
repurpose material if you will it's

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:29.210 
repurpose material if you will it's
already<00:05:18.820> existing<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:21.540> certainly<00:05:22.540> orange
