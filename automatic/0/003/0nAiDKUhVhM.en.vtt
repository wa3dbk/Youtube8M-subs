00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.980
 Yes, I said , I'm Rodrigo, yes. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.170
 I know I'm very late but today does 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 the best free games for the iss 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 android of the month of October and the first 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.240
 theirs is the zombie and 2 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.119
 do not confuse with him of eggs ongs this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.769
 here is another franchise is a species 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.859
 of bir and mato with which the characters 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.929
 appear large on the screen and you have 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 that kill zombies from each stage using 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.510
 long-range weapons or weapons with the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.879
 body even between the stages you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 buy bullets makes the laws in the equipment 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.670
 and be careful not to run out of ammo 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 during them if you do not have to go for pure 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 ass kicking I know the circus seems to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.059
 rough for the graphics but the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.219
 me is very interesting with a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 a little insight, you can already have 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.690
 that the style is the same as a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 life flashback where you have to go 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.939
 tapping to and fro and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 avoid hitting the obstacles but the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 Obstacles are present all the time 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.509
 and this is cool 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 you can not touch a line that is 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.580
 in the middle of the circle you control and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.979
 That's why you need to stay well connected to me. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.829
 record is still weak but all then 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.140
 improving already is an Icelandic error and 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.869
 this style can also saturate 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 some people but his cool is the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.009
 visual style 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.680
 the graphics are in 3d and roms the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.460
 very cool camera transitions that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.829
 leave the cute things on the screen beyond 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.079
 to deviate from the obstacle you need 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.810
 take out the enemies and clear the difficulty 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.509
 progressing friend you resist 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.799
 for who has the device and oeci is worth 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.799
 the tag tag there 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.909
 in the category of very simple games we have 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.610
 here the mecha shoulders 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.700
 the basic idea you should touch sumbe 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 that appear on the screen to crush the most 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.920
 also can not crush some humans 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.140
 which appears mixed at the beginning is 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.970
 extremely simple but then it ends 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.670
 staying cool with your humans if 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.800
 mix with zombies enough and you have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.920
 wait for the right time to play sound 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.860
 of must in addition the subs are also 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.959
 the stronger the ability comes 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.959
 I think it's cool and it's for everyone 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.450
 What a big hit then is when I 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280
 I knew that this version was coming out 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.440
 transformers or music ball because 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.080
 I thought it was going to be another variation of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.630
 style and vibrant star wars or whatever 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.519
 But it's not the case 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.799
 It is interesting that mechanics is a 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.260
 little different but at the same time brings 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.000
 that balcony in style and released 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.430
 You have to beat the enemies that 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.680
 appear on the stage playing on it. 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.840
 mainly destroying the platforms 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.700
 where they stay and there you have to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.280
 idea of what the best source these 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.840
 platforms to destroy and destroy 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.060
 their structure and 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.540
 I think they give a new air on the franchise and it's 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.540
 well worth 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.069
 the zombie qat is only has west beach by 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.010
 while and got me by the graphic style 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.180
 which is very cute and brings animations 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.120
 cool 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.700
 here the zombies are not the villains by 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.370
 otherwise you need to hunt them down 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.330
 phases by throwing the brains as bait and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.190
 then everything transformed and juice is a 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.290
 a simple proposal that is becoming more 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.720
 hard working friend you progress 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.099
 controls are very responsive and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.459
 easy to use 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.739
 The physics of shooting clubs is good the game 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.410
 for free then, although there are some 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:09.379
 waiting times that do not have to 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.660
 start download in the vein and install 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.540
 these were the indications of October one 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.700
 little delayed anyway I hope that 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.889
