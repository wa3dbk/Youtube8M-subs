five<00:01:49.710> different<00:01:50.040> pieces<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.790> five<00:01:51.420> different

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
five different pieces is five different

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
five different pieces is five different
pieces<00:01:52.259> really<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.040> portable<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:54.090> my

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
pieces really that portable that's my

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.499 
pieces really that portable that's my
question<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:56.159> does<00:01:56.460> work<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.880> landscape<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
question it does work with landscape and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.899 
question it does work with landscape and
portrait<00:01:57.540> I'll<00:01:58.020> give<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.530> however<00:01:59.520> there

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
portrait I'll give it that however there

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.789 
portrait I'll give it that however there
is<00:02:00.030> no<00:02:00.060> secure<00:02:00.570> cradle<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.259> iphone<00:02:01.560> or

is no secure cradle for your iphone or
your<00:02:01.829> ipod<00:02:02.250> touch<00:02:02.460> whereas<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> live<00:02:03.210> speaker

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
your ipod touch whereas the live speaker

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.350 
your ipod touch whereas the live speaker
holds<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> perfectly<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.250> place<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.729> secure

holds it perfectly in place and secure

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
holds it perfectly in place and secure
at<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.630> times<00:02:07.489> obviously<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> key

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
at all times obviously the key

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
at all times obviously the key
difference<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.569> these<00:02:09.720> wires<00:02:09.989> hanging

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
difference is all of these wires hanging

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.760 
difference is all of these wires hanging
out<00:02:10.619> however<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.360> battery<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.840> also<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> big

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
out however the battery is also a big

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.800 
out however the battery is also a big
problem<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.850> want<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> make<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> dll

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
problem if you want to make the dll

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
problem if you want to make the dll
portable<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.800> really<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.280> use<00:02:17.430> for

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
portable you really have to use for

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.150 
portable you really have to use for
triple-a<00:02:18.390> batteries<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.860> become<00:02:19.980> a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
triple-a batteries and this can become a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.220 
triple-a batteries and this can become a
costly<00:02:20.700> recurrence<00:02:21.330> if<00:02:21.570> you're<00:02:21.870> constantly

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
costly recurrence if you're constantly

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.630
