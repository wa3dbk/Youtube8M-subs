00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.199 
some you have energy meter what you have
on<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> nanosuit<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> what<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.760> Nanosuit

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
on is a nanosuit and what that Nanosuit

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.760

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
to do is conserve that energy meter to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.000 
to do is conserve that energy meter to
best<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.390> your<00:03:15.480> abilities<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:15.989> there<00:03:16.769> are<00:03:16.890> you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.180 
conserve energy and what to use and when
to<00:03:26.820> use<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.390> that's<00:03:28.350> what<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.739> struggling

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
I've used a lot actually is when I the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
mode when I see somebody and just kick

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.290 
mode when I see somebody and just kick
them<00:04:21.780> out<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.710> mean<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.280> all<00:04:23.520> about<00:04:23.850> this

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
them out but I mean it's all about this

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.180 
them out but I mean it's all about this
game<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.630> all<00:04:24.840> about<00:04:24.900> using<00:04:25.530> your<00:04:25.710> energy

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
game is all about using your energy

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.159 
game is all about using your energy
meter<00:04:26.370> when<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.699> need<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:27.990> all<00:04:28.139> about

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
meter when you need it it's all about

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.439 
meter when you need it it's all about
conservation<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.310> energy<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.729> using

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
conservation of that energy and using

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.110 
conservation of that energy and using
the<00:04:30.600> right<00:04:30.780> abilities<00:04:31.470> at<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.979> right<00:04:32.130> time<00:04:32.400> so

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
the right abilities at the right time so

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.029 
the right abilities at the right time so
there<00:04:33.389> is<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.539> lot<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.810> strategy<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:34.979> the

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
there is a lot of strategy to it in the

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.969 
there is a lot of strategy to it in the
aspect<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.900> can't<00:04:37.320> do<00:04:37.530> whatever<00:04:37.830> you

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
aspect that you can't do whatever you

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.129 
aspect that you can't do whatever you
want<00:04:38.190> when<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.550> want<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.060> there's<00:04:39.990> actually

want when you want and there's actually
guns<00:04:40.530> out<00:04:40.680> there<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.979> drain<00:04:41.190> your<00:04:41.280> energy

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
guns out there that drain your energy

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.219 
guns out there that drain your energy
suit<00:04:41.849> so<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.570> got<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.810> watch<00:04:42.900> out<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:43.110> that

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
and there's certain aspects in that

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.339 
and there's certain aspects in that
environment<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:45.510> can<00:04:45.780> drain<00:04:46.199> your<00:04:46.229> energy

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
environment that can drain your energy

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.400

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
and also you know there's multi-tiered

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.839 
and also you know there's multi-tiered
you<00:04:52.050> know<00:04:52.139> maps<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.710> stuff<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:53.099> can<00:04:53.250> jump<00:04:53.639> you

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
you know maps and stuff you can jump you

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.700 
you know maps and stuff you can jump you
know<00:04:54.030> super<00:04:54.360> how<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.510> got<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.530> know

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
know that that drains your energy also

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.529 
know that that drains your energy also
so<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:05.190> know<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.310> can't<00:05:05.699> stress<00:05:06.000> enough<00:05:06.150> how

so you know I can't stress enough how

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.070 
so you know I can't stress enough how
important<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> energy<00:05:07.889> meter<00:05:08.099> is<00:05:08.389> but<00:05:09.389> you

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
important the energy meter is but you

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.980 
important the energy meter is but you
know<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.889> just<00:05:11.220> besides<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.210> energy<00:05:12.570> meter

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
know that just besides the energy meter

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.219 
know that just besides the energy meter
and<00:05:13.500> everything<00:05:13.979> this<00:05:14.159> game<00:05:15.139> just<00:05:16.139> the

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
and everything this game just the
