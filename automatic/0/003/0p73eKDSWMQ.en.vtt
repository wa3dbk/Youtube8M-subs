00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
be working with the Strand that is

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.619 
be working with the Strand that is
furthest<00:00:35.769> to<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.100> right<00:00:36.220> this<00:00:36.820> one<00:00:37.059> over<00:00:37.300> here

then under the next strand in and that

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.959 
then under the next strand in and that
is<00:00:46.300> really<00:00:46.629> all<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:46.840> is<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.620> braid<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
is really all that is to the braid so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
under so if you can just repeat over

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.650 
under so if you can just repeat over
under<00:01:08.470> over<00:01:08.800> under<00:01:08.979> all<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.819> way<00:01:09.940> down<00:01:10.209> that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
under over under all the way down that

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.540 
under over under all the way down that
is<00:01:10.720> all<00:01:11.140> there<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.800> it<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:11.979> just<00:01:12.369> keep

is all there is to it you just keep

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.969 
is all there is to it you just keep
switching<00:01:12.849> sides<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.170> will<00:01:14.500> show<00:01:14.649> you<00:01:14.709> one

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
switching sides so I will show you one

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.850 
switching sides so I will show you one
more<00:01:15.039> time<00:01:15.399> starting<00:01:16.209> on<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.780> left<00:01:17.520> over<00:01:18.520> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
more time starting on the left over and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.779 
more time starting on the left over and
then<00:01:20.860> under<00:01:21.039> and<00:01:21.959> then<00:01:22.959> here<00:01:23.229> on<00:01:23.319> the<00:01:23.349> right

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
then under and then here on the right

then under and then here on the right
over<00:01:24.789> and<00:01:25.830> under<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.849> I<00:01:27.880> would<00:01:28.209> recommend

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
over and under so I would recommend

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.600 
over and under so I would recommend
practicing<00:01:28.959> this<00:01:29.500> braid<00:01:29.770> until<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:30.310> have<00:01:30.490> it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
practicing this braid until you have it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.940 
practicing this braid until you have it
down<00:01:30.849> and<00:01:31.209> then<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.599> can<00:01:31.810> try<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.349> waterfall

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
down and then you can try the waterfall

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.410 
down and then you can try the waterfall
braid<00:01:33.099> and<00:01:33.429> I<00:01:33.489> will<00:01:33.640> show<00:01:33.789> you<00:01:33.880> how<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.090> do<00:01:34.270> that

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
braid and I will show you how to do that

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.660 
braid and I will show you how to do that
right<00:01:35.349> now<00:01:36.959> so<00:01:37.959> now<00:01:38.349> we<00:01:38.410> are<00:01:38.770> ready<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.069> begin

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
right now so now we are ready to begin

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.460 
right now so now we are ready to begin
the<00:01:39.940> waterfall<00:01:40.420> braid<00:01:40.569> and<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.110> have<00:01:41.229> started

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
the waterfall braid and I have started

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.469 
the waterfall braid and I have started
just<00:01:41.770> by<00:01:41.890> grabbing<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.429> section<00:01:42.849> of<00:01:42.940> hair<00:01:43.090> up<00:01:43.330> at

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
just by grabbing a section of hair up at

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.540 
just by grabbing a section of hair up at
the<00:01:43.569> front<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.890> explain<00:01:45.130> this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
the front and then to explain this

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.370 
the front and then to explain this
instead<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.090> using<00:01:46.239> left<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.929> right<00:01:47.110> I'm

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
instead of using left and right I'm

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.070 
instead of using left and right I'm
going<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:47.770> use<00:01:47.979> top<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.759> bottom<00:01:49.300> because<00:01:49.929> the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
going to use top and bottom because the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.779 
going to use top and bottom because the
braid<00:01:50.289> is<00:01:50.530> kind<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:50.890> laying<00:01:51.099> on<00:01:51.310> its<00:01:51.489> side<00:01:51.759> and

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
braid is kind of laying on its side and

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.139 
braid is kind of laying on its side and
left<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:52.929> right<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.319> a<00:01:53.349> little<00:01:53.619> confusing<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
left and right is a little confusing so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.059 
left and right is a little confusing so
I'm<00:01:55.509> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.899> start<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.560> Strand<00:01:56.860> here

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
I'm going to start with the Strand here
