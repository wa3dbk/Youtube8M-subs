birds or something or what a fuck it is

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.070 
birds or something or what a fuck it is
and<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.489> there's<00:03:03.489> big<00:03:03.640> ol<00:03:03.819> mysterious<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.019> if

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
and so there's big ol mysterious and if

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.190 
and so there's big ol mysterious and if
they<00:03:05.230> figure<00:03:05.530> out<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:07.180> shoot<00:03:07.360> missiles<00:03:07.750> at
