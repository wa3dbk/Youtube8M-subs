certain<00:02:25.190> links<00:02:26.050> well<00:02:27.050> that's<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.800> may<00:02:27.920> as

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
certain links well that's going I may as

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.290 
certain links well that's going I may as
well<00:02:28.010> go<00:02:28.160> ahead<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.489> get<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.730> couple<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.120> extra

well go ahead and get a couple of extra

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.400 
well go ahead and get a couple of extra
drones<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:30.680> gonna<00:02:30.800> take<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> little<00:02:31.099> bit<00:02:32.410> if

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
drones that's gonna take a little bit if

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.770 
drones that's gonna take a little bit if
it<00:02:33.560> was<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.739> four<00:02:33.920> pool<00:02:34.190> I'd<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> lot<00:02:35.569> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
it was a four pool I'd have a lot and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780 
it was a four pool I'd have a lot and
less<00:02:36.019> drill<00:02:36.590> or<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> lost<00:02:37.130> mineral<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.760> I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
less drill or a lost mineral so I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.280 
less drill or a lost mineral so I
probably<00:02:38.000> wouldn't<00:02:38.450> be<00:02:38.599> able<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.049> but

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
probably wouldn't be able to do this but

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.350 
probably wouldn't be able to do this but
if<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.530> pull<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.099> can<00:02:40.880> keep<00:02:41.000> progressing<00:02:41.120> a

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
if I pull I can keep progressing a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.759 
if I pull I can keep progressing a
little<00:02:41.450> more<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.750> can<00:02:42.140> through<00:02:42.379> some<00:02:42.560> extra
