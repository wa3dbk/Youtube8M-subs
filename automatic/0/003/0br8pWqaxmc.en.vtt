00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
chips put them like so on top of each

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.830 
chips put them like so on top of each
other<00:04:08.340> get<00:04:09.270> a<00:04:09.300> third<00:04:09.660> ship<00:04:10.020> widget<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.770> between

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
other get a third ship widget in between

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.199 
other get a third ship widget in between
and<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.290> fourth<00:04:13.620> chat<00:04:13.980> widget<00:04:14.519> on<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:14.970> other

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
and a fourth chat widget on the other

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.280 
and a fourth chat widget on the other
side<00:04:15.540> then<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.290> was<00:04:16.410> seen<00:04:16.590> looks<00:04:16.859> like<00:04:17.040> that

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
side then that was seen looks like that

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.420 
side then that was seen looks like that
sort<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:19.330> 22<00:04:20.330> chips<00:04:20.630> with<00:04:20.960> two<00:04:21.170> on<00:04:21.320> each<00:04:21.440> end

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
sort of 22 chips with two on each end

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.219 
sort of 22 chips with two on each end
actually<00:04:23.030> i'll<00:04:23.120> use<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.449> white<00:04:23.570> ones<00:04:24.340> start<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
actually i'll use the white ones start a

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.830 
actually i'll use the white ones start a
2-1<00:04:27.229> between<00:04:27.699> one<00:04:28.699> in<00:04:28.820> between<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.509> end<00:04:29.690> up

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
2-1 between one in between you end up

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.529 
2-1 between one in between you end up
with<00:04:30.020> something<00:04:30.169> like<00:04:30.259> that<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:32.000> put<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.330> in

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
with something like that and put it in

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.499 
with something like that and put it in
hand<00:04:32.930> like<00:04:33.259> so<00:04:33.699> but<00:04:34.699> make<00:04:34.880> sure<00:04:34.910> that<00:04:35.090> this

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
hand like so but make sure that this

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.740 
hand like so but make sure that this
finger<00:04:35.990> see<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.800> one<00:04:37.270> this<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.419> actually

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
finger see this one this is actually

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.690 
finger see this one this is actually
stopping<00:04:39.139> this<00:04:39.560> package<00:04:40.009> it<00:04:40.130> from<00:04:40.340> moving

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
stopping this package it from moving

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.460 
stopping this package it from moving
because<00:04:42.300> all<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.570> force<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:43.050> going<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.290> go

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
because all the force is going to go

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.920 
because all the force is going to go
into<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.580> chip<00:04:44.850> forwards<00:04:45.360> but

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
into this chip forwards but

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.629 
into this chip forwards but
the<00:04:47.380> force<00:04:47.560> also<00:04:47.770> wants<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.160> make<00:04:48.280> this<00:04:48.430> check

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
the force also wants to make this check

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.580 
the force also wants to make this check
go<00:04:48.789> backwards<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.509> you've<00:04:49.660> got<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.870> stop<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.320> so

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
go backwards so you've got to stop it so

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.879 
go backwards so you've got to stop it so
this<00:04:50.710> one<00:04:50.860> goes<00:04:51.009> forwards<00:04:52.139> hey<00:04:53.139> wait<00:04:53.350> put

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
this one goes forwards hey wait put

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.950 
this one goes forwards hey wait put
another<00:04:53.979> chip<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.520> top<00:04:54.820> that's<00:04:55.150> one<00:04:55.330> is<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.840> and

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
another chip on top that's one is it and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.029 
another chip on top that's one is it and
this<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.050> why<00:04:59.139> it's<00:04:59.199> called<00:04:59.380> race<00:04:59.590> car<00:04:59.830> and

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
this is why it's called race car and

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.040 
this is why it's called race car and
then<00:05:00.310> your<00:05:00.430> hands<00:05:00.580> will<00:05:00.699> go<00:05:00.910> one

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
then your hands will go one

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.619 
then your hands will go one
to<00:05:02.819> look<00:05:03.819> where<00:05:04.060> it's<00:05:04.180> going<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.360> hit<00:05:04.479> because

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:04.629 
to look where it's going to hit because

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.619 
to look where it's going to hit because
it<00:05:04.780> might<00:05:04.870> break<00:05:05.110> something<00:05:05.669> one<00:05:06.669> a<00:05:07.150> tube

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
it might break something one a tube

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:13.230 
it might break something one a tube
three<00:05:10.860> good<00:05:11.860> over<00:05:12.009> there<00:05:12.159> somewhere<00:05:12.370> that's

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
three good over there somewhere that's

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.809 
three good over there somewhere that's
good<00:05:13.449> that<00:05:14.440> one's<00:05:14.560> called<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.860> rice<00:05:15.009> girl

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:24.040 

okay<00:05:18.819> um<00:05:19.360> next<00:05:19.900> trick<00:05:20.379> is<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:21.220> finger<00:05:21.460> roll

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.350 

it's<00:05:24.650> I'm<00:05:25.069> not<00:05:25.190> very<00:05:25.310> good<00:05:25.400> at<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.210> i'll

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
it's I'm not very good at it so i'll

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.719

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
let's get the chip chip and let it roll

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.580 
let's get the chip chip and let it roll
over<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.520> first<00:05:31.759> finger<00:05:32.050> then<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.199> second

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
over the first finger then the second

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.830 
over the first finger then the second
catch<00:05:33.889> it<00:05:34.129> on<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.280> third<00:05:34.580> catch<00:05:35.330> on<00:05:35.569> fourth

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
catch it on the third catch on fourth

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.589 
catch it on the third catch on fourth
pass<00:05:36.139> it<00:05:36.349> underneath<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:37.159> it<00:05:38.000> should<00:05:38.389> go

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
pass it underneath and it should go

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.619 
pass it underneath and it should go
around<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.229> a<00:05:39.259> circle<00:05:39.669> I'm<00:05:40.669> not<00:05:40.970> greater<00:05:41.300> this

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
around in a circle I'm not greater this

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.839 
around in a circle I'm not greater this
people<00:05:42.080> can<00:05:42.349> do<00:05:42.560> it<00:05:42.650> in<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.830> very<00:05:42.860> smooth<00:05:43.490> sort

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
people can do it in a very smooth sort

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.210 
people can do it in a very smooth sort
of<00:05:43.909> way<00:05:44.030> it<00:05:44.240> looks<00:05:44.389> nice<00:05:44.650> if<00:05:45.650> you<00:05:45.770> do<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:45.979> well

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
of way it looks nice if you do it well

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.070 
of way it looks nice if you do it well
it<00:05:46.639> should<00:05:46.909> look<00:05:47.030> like<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:47.479> just<00:05:47.690> floating

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
it should look like it's just floating

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.710 
it should look like it's just floating
Amy<00:05:48.530> finger<00:05:49.009> but<00:05:49.699> I'm<00:05:49.909> not<00:05:50.090> great<00:05:50.330> at<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.539> one

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
Amy finger but I'm not great at that one

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.990 
Amy finger but I'm not great at that one
okay<00:05:51.680> next<00:05:52.580> trick<00:05:53.389> is<00:05:53.629> called<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.349> pic<00:05:54.680> over<00:05:55.069> I

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
okay next trick is called the pic over I

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.740 
okay next trick is called the pic over I
normally<00:05:56.629> use<00:05:57.250> six<00:05:58.250> chips<00:05:58.639> you<00:05:59.419> can<00:05:59.599> have<00:05:59.719> two

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
normally use six chips you can have two

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.170 
normally use six chips you can have two
stacks<00:06:00.259> of<00:06:00.469> three<00:06:00.830> what<00:06:01.639> you're<00:06:01.759> doing<00:06:02.000> here

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
stacks of three what you're doing here

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.300 
stacks of three what you're doing here
is<00:06:02.270> walking<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.870> chips<00:06:03.169> in<00:06:03.620> a<00:06:03.889> sort<00:06:04.099> of<00:06:04.129> any

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
is walking the chips in a sort of any

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.029 
is walking the chips in a sort of any
direction<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.789> want<00:06:05.060> use<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.259> forefinger

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
direction you want use the forefinger

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.580 
direction you want use the forefinger
and<00:06:07.099> thumb<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:08.300> push<00:06:08.539> down<00:06:08.599> with<00:06:09.110> a<00:06:09.169> thermal<00:06:09.530> to

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
and thumb to push down with a thermal to

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.649 
and thumb to push down with a thermal to
lift<00:06:09.830> with<00:06:10.159> the<00:06:10.190> forefinger<00:06:10.879> it<00:06:11.060> should<00:06:11.389> give

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
lift with the forefinger it should give

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.480 
lift with the forefinger it should give
you<00:06:11.750> enough<00:06:11.780> space<00:06:12.289> to<00:06:12.319> put<00:06:12.620> it<00:06:12.770> on<00:06:12.889> top<00:06:13.190> of

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
you enough space to put it on top of

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.649 
you enough space to put it on top of
your<00:06:14.270> next<00:06:14.539> stack<00:06:14.780> so<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:16.669> then<00:06:16.879> use<00:06:17.330> the

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
your next stack so and then use the

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.950 
your next stack so and then use the
these<00:06:18.319> two<00:06:18.349> ring<00:06:19.069> finger<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:19.759> middle<00:06:19.969> finger

thumbed<00:06:21.350> to<00:06:21.949> drop<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.310> stack<00:06:22.550> down<00:06:22.819> again<00:06:23.199> so

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
thumbed to drop the stack down again so

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.779 
thumbed to drop the stack down again so
it<00:06:24.259> should<00:06:24.919> look<00:06:25.190> like<00:06:25.370> that<00:06:25.819> when<00:06:26.120> it's<00:06:26.300> going

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
reasonable pace it's not a very useful

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.430
