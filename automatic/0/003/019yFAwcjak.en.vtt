00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
is a very easy recipe so as I said first

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:35.920 
is a very easy recipe so as I said first
put<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> scale<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.180> 0<00:00:31.129> 60<00:00:32.129> grams<00:00:32.400> of<00:00:33.620> honey

put the scale on 0 60 grams of honey

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:46.010 
put the scale on 0 60 grams of honey
close<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.170> lid<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:44.149> gradually<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.750> gonna

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
close the lid and gradually we gonna

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.340 
close the lid and gradually we gonna
increase<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> speed<00:00:47.309> until<00:00:48.059> four

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.279 

through<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.430> top<00:00:55.480> nothing<00:00:56.480> makes<00:00:56.780> us<00:00:57.050> by

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
through the top nothing makes us by

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.029 
through the top nothing makes us by
lifting<00:00:57.680> up<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:57.980> measures<00:00:59.019> as<00:01:00.019> soon<00:01:00.379> as<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
lifting up the measures as soon as the

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.240 
lifting up the measures as soon as the
better<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:02.510> honey<00:01:02.750> are<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.110> nice<00:01:03.620> smooth

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
better and the honey are a nice smooth

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.070 
better and the honey are a nice smooth
and<00:01:05.140> light<00:01:06.140> creamy<00:01:07.130> texture<00:01:07.899> we're<00:01:08.899> gonna

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
and light creamy texture we're gonna

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.840 
and light creamy texture we're gonna
stop<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.530> Machine<00:01:12.040> open<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.159> lid<00:01:13.310> again<00:01:13.430> and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
stop the Machine open the lid again and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.960 
stop the Machine open the lid again and
add<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.380> chocolate<00:01:15.649> so<00:01:16.190> scale<00:01:16.729> again<00:01:17.350> on<00:01:18.350> zero

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:30.550 

500<00:01:22.970> grams<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.390> chocolate<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:29.350> switch<00:01:30.350> on

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
500 grams of chocolate and switch on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.109 
500 grams of chocolate and switch on
again<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.009> machine<00:01:32.679> until<00:01:33.679> speed<00:01:34.240> for<00:01:37.119> as

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
again the machine until speed for as

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.540 
again the machine until speed for as
soon<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.569> everything<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.289> nice<00:01:39.560> mixed<00:01:40.100> we're

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
soon as everything is nice mixed we're

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.040 
soon as everything is nice mixed we're
gonna<00:01:40.759> reduce<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.420> speed<00:01:41.690> until<00:01:42.470> two<00:01:43.130> and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
gonna reduce the speed until two and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.700 
gonna reduce the speed until two and
adding<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.500> 60<00:01:46.190> grams<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.670> rum<00:01:47.509> liqueur

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.180 

increase<00:01:51.710> again<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.310> speeds

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.430 

and<00:01:57.190> on<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:58.180> may<00:01:58.390> not<00:01:58.600> stir<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.110> too<00:01:59.260> much

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
and on we may not stir it too much

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.280 
and on we may not stir it too much
otherwise<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.820> filling<00:02:01.360> will<00:02:01.480> be<00:02:01.690> too<00:02:01.990> soft

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
otherwise the filling will be too soft

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.620 
otherwise the filling will be too soft
and<00:02:02.680> then<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.130> have<00:02:03.280> difficulties<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.030> pipe<00:02:04.450> it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
and then we have difficulties to pipe it

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.650 
and then we have difficulties to pipe it
as<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.650> can<00:02:05.860> see<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.280> beautiful<00:02:06.970> texture<00:02:07.360> now

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
as you can see a beautiful texture now

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.280 
as you can see a beautiful texture now
ready<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.860> pipe<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.630> also<00:02:10.810> put<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
ready to pipe you can also put the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.960 
ready to pipe you can also put the
truffle<00:02:11.650> mixture<00:02:11.980> into<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.340> fridge<00:02:12.640> for<00:02:12.910> a

little thick when it's in the fridge and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.340 
little thick when it's in the fridge and
you<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:24.220> put<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.490> back<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.360> thermomix<00:02:26.050> and

you can put it back on the thermomix and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.550 
you can put it back on the thermomix and
just<00:02:27.070> blend<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.580> for<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.820> few<00:02:28.030> seconds<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.900> order

just blend it for a few seconds in order
to<00:02:29.590> make<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.980> mixture<00:02:30.250> lighter<00:02:30.640> again<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.390> we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290

something heavy on the paper to avoid
that<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.360> paper<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.780> sliding<00:02:53.650> away<00:02:53.770> while<00:02:54.430> you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
that the paper is sliding away while you

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.330 
that the paper is sliding away while you
pipe<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.150> first<00:02:55.420> row<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:56.320> can<00:02:56.560> type<00:02:56.830> round

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340
