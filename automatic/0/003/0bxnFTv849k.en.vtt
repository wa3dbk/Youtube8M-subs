to effectively create space you need to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.050 
to effectively create space you need to
be<00:00:19.560> aggressively<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.609> hard<00:00:20.820> as

defender off the dribble you need to get

defender off the dribble you need to get
the<00:00:26.130> defender<00:00:26.519> sliding<00:00:27.090> hard<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> cut<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.960> off

the defender sliding hard to cut you off

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.290 
the defender sliding hard to cut you off
try<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> defender<00:00:29.400> moving<00:00:29.699> hard<00:00:30.029> in

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
try to get the defender moving hard in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.669 
try to get the defender moving hard in
the<00:00:30.359> direction<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> you're<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:30.990> once

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the direction that you're going once

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.260 
the direction that you're going once
their<00:00:31.859> momentum<00:00:32.160> shifts<00:00:32.820> towards<00:00:33.120> this

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
their momentum shifts towards this

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.970 
their momentum shifts towards this
direction<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.290> perfect<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
direction this is the perfect time to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
direction this is the perfect time to
create<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.399> space<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.690> defender

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
create that space if the defender

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.780 
create that space if the defender
doesn't<00:00:37.140> slide<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:37.980> front<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> cut<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
doesn't slide in front of you to cut you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
doesn't slide in front of you to cut you
off<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.300> you've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> defender<00:00:40.170> beat

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
off then you've got the defender beat

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.380 
off then you've got the defender beat
going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> basket<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> therefore<00:00:42.180> don't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
going to the basket and therefore don't

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
going to the basket and therefore don't
need<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> retreat<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.260> create<00:00:43.559> space<00:00:43.710> when

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
need to retreat and create space when

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
need to retreat and create space when
you<00:00:44.460> attack<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> defender<00:00:45.539> shoulders

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you attack and get a defender shoulders

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.840 
you attack and get a defender shoulders
turn<00:00:46.230> similar<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:47.700> much

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
turn similar to this they're pretty much

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.270 
turn similar to this they're pretty much
at<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.149> mercy<00:00:48.539> whether<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> keep<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:50.100> or

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
at your mercy whether you keep going or

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.660 
at your mercy whether you keep going or
quickly<00:00:51.210> stop<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> create<00:00:52.140> space<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> main

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
quickly stop and create space the main

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
quickly stop and create space the main
thing<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.600> attack<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.530> attack

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
thing here is that you attack and attack

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.639 
thing here is that you attack and attack
hard<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.329> far<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.260> each

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hard go as far as you can up each

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
hard go as far as you can up each
attacking<00:00:59.370> drip<00:00:59.640> attack<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> react<00:01:02.270> if<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
attacking drip attack and react if you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
attacking drip attack and react if you
just<00:01:03.750> step<00:01:04.110> back<00:01:04.409> without<00:01:04.680> getting<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just step back without getting the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
just step back without getting the
defender<00:01:05.700> moving<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.210> good<00:01:06.630> defender<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
defender moving a good defender that is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
defender moving a good defender that is
playing<00:01:07.619> aggressively<00:01:08.220> will<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.820> likely

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
playing aggressively will be more likely

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
playing aggressively will be more likely
to<00:01:09.360> stay<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.740> saying<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to stay with you I'm not saying that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.649 
to stay with you I'm not saying that
this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> only<00:01:11.700> time<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.450> be

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this is the only time you can be

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.780 
this is the only time you can be
effective<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.170> creating<00:01:13.350> space<00:01:13.830> sometimes

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
effective in creating space sometimes

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
effective in creating space sometimes
I'll<00:01:15.000> initially<00:01:15.479> freeze<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> defender<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I'll initially freeze a defender and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.950 
I'll initially freeze a defender and
then<00:01:17.100> quickly<00:01:17.700> step<00:01:17.970> back<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> create<00:01:18.630> space

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
then quickly step back to create space

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.899 
then quickly step back to create space
it<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.470> depends<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> situation<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.700> the

it all depends on the situation but the
