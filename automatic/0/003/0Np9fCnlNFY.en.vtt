about that was good determination from
him<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:39.000> he<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> discard

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
him there but he would you discard

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
striker and that's what you get from a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
striker and that's what you get from a
discard<00:01:42.090> striker<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.439> being<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.890> the
