the longer the hair the more water there
is<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.680> everybody's<00:00:56.370> seen<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:58.020> take<00:00:58.230> your

towel you put it up on top of your head

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.840 
towel you put it up on top of your head
like<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.230> clearly<00:01:02.070> there's<00:01:02.340> hair<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
like this clearly there's hair in it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.280 
like this clearly there's hair in it
that's<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> good<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.110> hair

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that's not that good for your hair

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
that's not that good for your hair
because<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.799> hair<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
because your hair is going up and it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420 
because your hair is going up and it's
also<00:01:06.360> curved<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.979> curves<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
also curved into all of the curves on

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.120 
also curved into all of the curves on
the<00:01:08.549> towel<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> twist<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.439> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the towel when you twist it like that so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
the towel when you twist it like that so
therefore<00:01:11.610> since<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.970> hair<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.360> wet<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
therefore since your hair is wet it's a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
therefore since your hair is wet it's a
lot<00:01:13.890> more<00:01:14.220> prone<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> breakage<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:16.200> means

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
lot more prone to breakage which means

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
lot more prone to breakage which means
that<00:01:16.799> when<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.549> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that when it's up like that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
that when it's up like that
it's<00:01:18.509> being<00:01:19.110> stressed<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> best<00:01:20.340> way

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it's being stressed out but the best way

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's being stressed out but the best way
is<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> keep<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
is to keep it down if you're going to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
is to keep it down if you're going to
push<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.299> towel<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:24.960> head<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.140> a
