 this 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.630
 92 hello ladies and gentlemen welcome 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.120
 Welcome to the world of incorruptible reviews from 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.770
 super firecracker I ran into a small 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.570
 problem before writing this review 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 and now I will try to explain it to you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.980
 so that later there would be no 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 questions to begin with many of you 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.060
 asked in the comments on what 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 criteria I choose the game to review the answer 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.590
 simple by overvalued nasty games in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 the media and you know I firmly decided that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.700
 my next review will be about the game 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 with the girl starring because of which 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.070
 the game I became overvalued so here I am 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 long I thought to do a new survey on the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.479
 rider or on bioshock infinite and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.680
 After playing in the lobby of the game in judgment I decided that with 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.170
 tomb raider everything is clear 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.729
 chick runs around the island shakes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.450
 low poly my tits 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.190
 kills aborigines or pirates or am i 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.040
 and did not understand what kind of devils and in general to 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.590
 why are they all wildly scripted 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 Well here it is, as it were, and have my little 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.070
 review on that rider but with shock all 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.100
 more running so let's 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.280
 to understand that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.990
 92 and before you say something about the plot 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.700
 look how the game starts i just 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.820
 fucked off this ancient style screensaver 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.380
 90s type ha ha we have such self-irony 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.149
 our game is ancient shit well we can 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.289
 laugh at yourself no your game 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.880
 really old shit 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.520
 you should be ashamed of that you are not 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.709
 should insert it at the very beginning of the game 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.050
 so that a person went into it looked but 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.050
 here it is on this bucket 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.700
 ok let's talk about the plot and how you see 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.440
 trying to feed us from the very beginning 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.880
 stereotypical philosophical shit 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.100
 whose game is just crazy 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.540
 amount any quotes with supposedly 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.480
 deep sense of reflection on the topic 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 religion is easiest of all this in the game in bulk 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.530
 so if you want to join 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.440
 chemical community new so lazy 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.600
 read the remark or butler and your bioshock 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.489
 the choice is all the same now anyway 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.640
 do not distinguish a quote from bioshok acetate and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.840
 the same Baudelaire and as for the plot 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.330
 I will try to briefly tell what's what 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 here you are either special agent or spy 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.710
 and someone tells you to ebash in some 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
 cloudy city and look there chick 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.630
 who got lost there in the way of you 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.090
 there are villains obstacles you 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.760
 learn how to fight shoots use 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.740
 magic and do everything about what parents 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.290
 should have told you in fairy tales 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.420
 night but if for some reason this 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.000
 It did not happen, and the folder you are replaced by dandy 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.450
 while he booze you can play bioshock 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.330
 and catch up yes 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.489
 92 as if the first thing that catches the eye 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.769
 this is the sensitivity of the mouse here you see 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.110
 what's going on I just couldn't play 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.510
 the very beginning because I now appeared 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.030
 climbed this ladder and all the camera 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.459
 start pidarasia 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.750
 ate moving the mouse to it just spinning and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.140
 side to side as if i'm under 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.290
 Aids now sticking up so we go on 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.599
 the gameplay immediately wants to say that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.519
 it's terrible corridor game and now 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.799
 I say absolutely seriously this is 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.440
 rectilinear corridor game in which 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.569
 I played in the last ten years here 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.450
 left-right no branches at all 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.510
 no here just go here right on 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.670
 plot and everything as it were while writing 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.560
 I sometimes wanted to review w 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.200
 chewing gum just get away on business because 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.329
 Well, it is impossible not fun to play you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.790
 just run right is not a big hi from 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.320
 90s here there are scattered everywhere and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.769
 coins for which you can buy 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.210
 first aid kits and cartridges you need so here 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.400
 feet nation ball on every shelves 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.110
 look for these coins so you can buy for 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.020
 I do not know these kits in my opinion 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.200
 My opinion in the game was very outdated. 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.090
 2013 such garbage should not be and I 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.280
 I do not know how it will be at the beginning 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.250
 the game just hits the stupid heat of the main 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.389
 hero let's just consider the situation 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.979
 unknown people tell you to look 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.720
 some chick in town 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.460
 which is in the clouds and get on it 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.770
 can only be through the lighthouse which 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.780
 the open sea they take you there by boat 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.430
 leave in may those you find pipes and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.950
 strange leather red chair 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.620
 hand clasps well yes why not 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.060
 sit him what a bad husband happen what 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.280
 concerns the rest of the component 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.750
 gameplay is the usual joker which 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.000
 now a great many divorced 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.010
 you run down the corridor you shoot out 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.009
 several weapons sometimes you can 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.710
 strike hand to hand everything 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.330
 there is nothing new there is another very 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.669
 fun component that 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.919
 the developers probably decided to insert into 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.930
 the game of personal life is the so-called 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.789
 salts that inhabit the main character 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.789
 supernatural abilities so 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.770
 here's salami supposedly bath salts 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.960
 as they call them now is 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.839
 a new formula for speeds which apparently 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.089
 developers and use advertise 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.439
 your suit budget you siri trying 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.899
 cut the money back from the manufacturers 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.849
 drug and in general effect is it 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:45.430
 the usual magic which you saw already 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.430
 million times other games nothing new 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.219
 92 hell are you looking footage from this game 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.930
 already a few minutes do i need 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.669
 tell you again what she is 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.770
 it looks disgusting 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.270
 disgusting not even for 2013 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.789
 just disgusting with aesthetic 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.800
 point of view this ugly game 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:07.120
 for the console that came out 8 years ago 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.120
 nothing surprising 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:17.169
 92 only sound in this game make it clear 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.129
 then it is not counter strike 1 6 and 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.909
 developers are finally active 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:25.009
 normal microphone of course i can't 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.159
 say that the sound is outstanding in this game 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.229
 no definitely not but vomit from him is not 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.909
 pulls and it is already well what can not be said 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.960
 for example other game components like 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:37.810
 gameplay and plot 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.810
 from which I personally blew a couple of times 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.889
 92 Summing up I want to note that I do not 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.259
 words did not say pop-eyed chicks for 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.479
 who runs our character aerial 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.340
 a city like Disney Land with weird 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.860
 diys melee weapons and which even 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.840
 I do not want to say all this is too much playing 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.129
 disgusting even without these details though 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.479
 with them she becomes for real 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.400
 tear out eye 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.979
 chick can only like you if 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.199
 you used to jerk off on anime or whatever 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.840
 This Japanese harey is called no 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.139
 empathy history does not cause all 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.669
 is this a fairy tale about a city in the clouds 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.529
 an ugly tale about an ugly city 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.949
 like this, so can a person with 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:23.080
 completely missing a sense of taste with 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.080
 you were super betar 92 until new meetings
