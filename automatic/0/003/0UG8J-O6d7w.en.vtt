two<00:00:00.780> days<00:00:00.989> ago<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.879> gave<00:00:02.879> myself<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.419> bit<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.659> a

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
two days ago I gave myself a bit of a

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.150 
two days ago I gave myself a bit of a
fright<00:00:03.929> when<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.319> was<00:00:04.440> trying<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> clear<00:00:04.980> this

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
fright when I was trying to clear this

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.940 
fright when I was trying to clear this
tree<00:00:05.460> off<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> fence<00:00:06.500> first<00:00:07.500> thing<00:00:07.830> that

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
tree off the fence first thing that

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.070 
tree off the fence first thing that
happened<00:00:08.309> was<00:00:09.179> when<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:10.370> made<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.610> cut<00:00:12.740> the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
happened was when I made this cut the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.900 
happened was when I made this cut the
sprocket<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> nose<00:00:16.560> into<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> chainsaw

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
sprocket on the nose into the chainsaw

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.630 
sprocket on the nose into the chainsaw
bar<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:19.170> completely<00:00:19.710> gummed<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:22.640> had

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
bar that completely gummed up and I had

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.990 
bar that completely gummed up and I had
to<00:00:23.789> stop<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.269> take<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> bar<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> chain

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
to stop and take the bar and the chain

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.050 
to stop and take the bar and the chain
off<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> clean<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.810> property<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.060> at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
off and clean this property up and at

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.450 
off and clean this property up and at
first<00:00:30.330> sight<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.720> thought<00:00:31.140> I'd<00:00:31.320> cut<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lizard

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
first sight I thought I'd cut a lizard

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.830 
first sight I thought I'd cut a lizard
in<00:00:32.579> half<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.570> red

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
in half because there was so much red

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
in half because there was so much red
stuff<00:00:34.110> coming<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.270> there's<00:00:36.270> still

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
stuff coming out of here there's still

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.060 
stuff coming out of here there's still
little<00:00:36.899> bits<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> red<00:00:37.320> stuff<00:00:37.559> there<00:00:38.540> anyway<00:00:39.540> I

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
little bits of red stuff there anyway I

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.819 
little bits of red stuff there anyway I
bravely<00:00:41.070> moved<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> made<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> next<00:00:43.500> cut

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
bravely moved on and made the next cut

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.529 
bravely moved on and made the next cut
and<00:00:44.250> when<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> made<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.940> cut

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.180 

there<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> terrifying<00:00:49.350> sight<00:00:50.270> there<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
there was a terrifying sight there was a

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.350 
there was a terrifying sight there was a
spurred<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:54.809> blood<00:00:55.579> colored<00:00:56.579> looking<00:00:57.059> SAP

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
spurred this blood colored looking SAP

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.229 
spurred this blood colored looking SAP
squirted<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> continued<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
squirted out of here and it continued to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.560 
squirted out of here and it continued to
squirt<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.379> particular<00:01:02.250> hole<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.000> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
squirt and this particular hole here it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.760 
squirt and this particular hole here it
continued<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> pulse<00:01:04.610> for<00:01:05.610> five<00:01:06.000> minutes

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
continued to pulse for five minutes

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
continued to pulse for five minutes
while<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.830> filmed<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.479> made<00:01:10.140> mysterious

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
while I filmed it and made mysterious

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.690 
while I filmed it and made mysterious
comments<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:11.689> when<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> cut<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> off<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
comments and then when I cut it off I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.460 
comments and then when I cut it off I
found<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> other<00:01:16.140> end<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> log

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.749 

at<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> other<00:01:22.799> end<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> love<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> part

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
at the other end of the love the part

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.890 
at the other end of the love the part
that<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.210> bleeding<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> top<00:01:26.009> here

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
that was bleeding was at the top here

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
that was bleeding was at the top here
alright<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.450> reservoir<00:01:30.840> appears<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.670> go

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
alright so the reservoir appears to go

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.760 
alright so the reservoir appears to go
from<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:34.340> under<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> top<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> bark<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
from here under the top of the bark and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.789 
from here under the top of the bark and
down<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> segment<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.259> bleeding<00:01:40.680> at

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
down to the segment that was bleeding at

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.899 
down to the segment that was bleeding at
the<00:01:40.890> bottom<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.060> fairly<00:01:42.540> important

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
the bottom and that's fairly important

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.719 
the bottom and that's fairly important
when<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.030> come<00:01:45.240> over<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.579> that's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
when we come over to the bit that's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.999 
when we come over to the bit that's
attached<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.390> root<00:01:48.540> ball<00:01:49.700> it's<00:01:51.710> lying<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
attached to the root ball it's lying in

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.420 
attached to the root ball it's lying in
the<00:01:53.130> same<00:01:53.340> position<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.600> was

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
the same position that it was

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.030 
the same position that it was
essentially<00:01:56.430> pointing<00:01:56.850> downhill<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
essentially pointing downhill so all the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.850 
essentially pointing downhill so all the
SAP<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:00.689> uphill<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> cut

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
SAP that was in it was uphill of the cut

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.530 
SAP that was in it was uphill of the cut
and<00:02:02.790> here's<00:02:03.860> where<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> liquid<00:02:05.880> cut<00:02:06.299> was

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and here's where the liquid cut was

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.290 
and here's where the liquid cut was
oozing<00:02:06.810> again<00:02:07.619> more<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.429> less<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.819> top<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
oozing again more or less on top of the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.340 
oozing again more or less on top of the
log<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.459> they<00:02:11.459> might<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.879> been<00:02:12.000> ten<00:02:12.300> liters

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
log so they might have been ten liters

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.420 
log so they might have been ten liters
they've<00:02:14.070> read<00:02:14.370> stuff<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.690> long<00:02:16.430> pipe

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
they've read stuff in this long pipe

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.620 
they've read stuff in this long pipe
just<00:02:18.240> underneath<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.840> bark<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.240> top<00:02:21.480> of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
just underneath the bark on the top of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.700 
just underneath the bark on the top of
the<00:02:21.720> log<00:02:21.900> which<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:22.860> spirals<00:02:23.520> over<00:02:23.910> and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
the log which then spirals over and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.850 
the log which then spirals over and
pressurizes<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:29.400> part<00:02:29.700> here<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
pressurizes this part here and when the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.190 
pressurizes this part here and when the
air<00:02:32.010> gets<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.730> allows<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:35.240> bubble<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.690> go<00:02:36.870> up

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
air gets in it allows a bubble to go up

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.230 
air gets in it allows a bubble to go up
to<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> top<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> reservoir<00:02:38.160> which<00:02:38.880> allows

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
to the top of the reservoir which allows

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.490 
to the top of the reservoir which allows
a<00:02:39.600> blob<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.860> SAP<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.400> coming<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:43.020> comes<00:02:43.290> out

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
a blob of SAP to coming up it comes out

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.950 
a blob of SAP to coming up it comes out
with<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.710> rush<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.610> then<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.390> near<00:02:45.570> bubble
