00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.280 
actually in a box designed for two eight
inch<00:03:20.530> subs<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:22.090> think<00:03:22.570> together<00:03:22.900> it's<00:03:23.170> just

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
inch subs and I think together it's just

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.230 
inch subs and I think together it's just
under<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:24.730> cube<00:03:25.570> each<00:03:26.580> they're<00:03:27.580> both<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.120> their

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
under a cube each they're both in their

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.199 
under a cube each they're both in their
own<00:03:28.300> chamber<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.640> they<00:03:30.640> sound<00:03:30.910> pretty<00:03:31.090> good

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
own chamber and they sound pretty good

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.470 
own chamber and they sound pretty good
