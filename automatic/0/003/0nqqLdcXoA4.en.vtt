00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.319
 here is one of the watches connect the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 more expected of the moment and that's it 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:17.820
 landed in France you will discover 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:20.789
 on 01net tv is the age and the hrc yes 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 i watch rr as holland as round 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 yes because she is round this watch 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.939
 look at it's the second round watch 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 who arrives after the 360 ​​bike with a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.500
 20 inch screen 3 a screen with a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.420
 particularity is that it is in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.469
 oled plastic I think it's one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.239
 first watches to have this 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.160
 technology that brings a luminosity 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.290
 and an impressive contrast yes with 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 tell us she I have a consumption 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
 less electric so that should 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.930
 allow to gain a little bit in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 autonomy so look it's nice 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.780
 to see a connected watch finally who 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 looks like a watch 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.329
 but still, even if she is a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.739
 little strong maousse anyway 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 it is a bit massive a it is true that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.059
 it's alright for a geek bracelet 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
 he comes well manly will come musky it's going 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.600
 by cons on a bracelet on a wall 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.230
 feminine it's a little bit more their 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.579
 group 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.260
 imagine that in a few years 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 will come out two models a bridge of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 men and for women but that's 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.770
 true it's rather a watch 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 masculine despite everything to the point 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.229
 of features it must be said 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.150
 that she looks a lot like 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.170
 the 360 ​​bike and that's normal since at 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 inside these two same software 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's android ware so what is it 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.600
 can do with and receive well 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.490
 notifications from his smartphone there is a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.229
 heart sensor altogether you have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.400
 the memory inside 4 gigas so 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.290
 you can not store any music 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.180
 and if you do sport at peret a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.140
 bluetooth headset and no longer need 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.909
 of smartphones 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 the music that transmits the watch 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.670
 up to your helmet you see that there is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.650
 several versions in any case several 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.320
 types of bracelets on the other hand the watch 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.360
 it even remains the same with this frame 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.110
 outside good we like or we do not like 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.390
 in any case it's really the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.250
 particularity then surrendered sergewa dear 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.299
 that's what's practiced it's like that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.579
 also on the button we can change 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.860
 truly the decor of his watch to the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.229
 dial fill in very things 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 classic but also very futuristic she 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.729
 weighs 62 g go a little heavier 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.380
 that milling 360 a little bit more and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.149
 then want to watch them both coast 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.520
 by the side what it gives on a wrist in 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.469
 reality the screen of the lg and a forelock 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.969
 is a little smaller but the watch 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.800
 she herself is a little bigger 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.020
 410 million euro pair battery 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.330
 and laughing no induction charging 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.070
 like the bike 360 look at it there are some 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.720
 small dots on the back of the watch 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.040
 for it to recharge it all is enough 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.120
 Simply paste in the small 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.800
 charge which makes it come back to little 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.150
 close to the same apple returns he laid 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.140
 on the charger and you have to put the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.340
 little pawns face we can not the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.530
 recharge she reopened not right
