disk in it automatically starts up when

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.090 
disk in it automatically starts up when
you<00:03:32.830> power<00:03:33.100> on<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:38.170> we'll<00:03:38.680> play<00:03:38.860> some

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
you power on and we'll play some

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:54.940 
you power on and we'll play some

as<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.310> see<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.609> load<00:03:56.790> time<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.269> this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
as you can see the load time on this

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.849 
as you can see the load time on this
thing<00:03:57.629> is<00:03:57.810> pretty<00:03:58.079> slow<00:03:59.480> which<00:04:00.709> didn't<00:04:01.709> make

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
thing is pretty slow which didn't make

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:15.890 
thing is pretty slow which didn't make
this<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:14.579> that's<00:04:14.879> I<00:04:15.090> think<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.510> Sherwood

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
this and that's I think in Sherwood

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.009 
this and that's I think in Sherwood
Forest<00:04:18.169> Loxley<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:21.630> it

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
Forest Loxley so that's it

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.129 
Forest Loxley so that's it
that's<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.410> Magnavox<00:04:22.770> CBI<00:04:23.400> 550<00:04:24.360> hope<00:04:25.020> you
