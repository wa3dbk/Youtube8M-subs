00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
materials simple you're ready to go

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.370 
materials simple you're ready to go
so<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.840> ready<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.289> go

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so now that we're actually ready to go

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.569 
so now that we're actually ready to go
we're<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.829> get<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> position

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
we're just going to get this in position

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.590 
we're just going to get this in position
we're<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> move<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> perpendicular

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
we're going to move this perpendicular

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870 
we're going to move this perpendicular
so<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.500> sticky<00:01:19.799> side<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.219> on<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.460> side<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
so this sticky side is on this side and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.859 
so this sticky side is on this side and
the<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.990> rigid<00:01:22.229> side<00:01:22.469> is<00:01:22.680> closer<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.280> us<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
the more rigid side is closer to us and

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
the more rigid side is closer to us and
now<00:01:24.869> we're<00:01:25.289> just<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.649> pull<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.610> back

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
now we're just going to pull this back

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
now we're just going to pull this back
just<00:01:27.179> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.289> we've<00:01:28.469> got<00:01:28.649> first<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
just a little bit so we've got first to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.999 
just a little bit so we've got first to
the<00:01:29.399> sticky<00:01:29.610> area<00:01:29.820> exposed<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.350> we're

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the sticky area exposed and now we're

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.559 
the sticky area exposed and now we're
just<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> plant<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.060> really

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
just going to plant that really

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.029 
just going to plant that really
carefully<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.649> end<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.909> phone

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
carefully on the end of the phone

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.690 
carefully on the end of the phone
obviously<00:01:38.039> it's<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.310> start<00:01:38.460> sticking

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
obviously it's going to start sticking

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
obviously it's going to start sticking
at<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.719> you<00:01:39.750> want<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> make<00:01:40.229> sure

you're going to be doing slowly

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.490 
you're going to be doing slowly
revealing<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.539> of<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> while<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.319> pushing

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
revealing more of it while it's pushing

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710

it down with your fingers so we're just

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
it down with your fingers so we're just
going<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.079> moving<00:01:55.200> along<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:56.030> slowly

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
going to be moving along here slowly

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569 
going to be moving along here slowly
slowly<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.929> you<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.619> keep<00:01:58.979> pushing<00:01:59.399> along

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
slowly as you go just keep pushing along

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.029 
slowly as you go just keep pushing along
keep<00:02:00.119> pushing<00:02:00.509> along<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:01.649> worry<00:02:01.799> too<00:02:02.009> much

if<00:02:02.220> there<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> few<00:02:02.849> air<00:02:03.060> bubbles<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.539> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
if there are a few air bubbles at this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.539 
if there are a few air bubbles at this
stage<00:02:04.099> you<00:02:05.099> do<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.489> to<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.759> keep<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.829> as<00:02:07.829> far

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
stage you do want to just keep it as far

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.069 
stage you do want to just keep it as far
away<00:02:08.670> from<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> dust<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.299> you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:09.959> is

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
away from the dust as you can which is

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.120 
away from the dust as you can which is
why<00:02:10.229> we're<00:02:10.579> kind<00:02:11.579> of<00:02:11.750> only<00:02:12.750> revealing<00:02:13.130> apart

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
why we're kind of only revealing apart

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.370 
why we're kind of only revealing apart
to<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> dust<00:02:14.610> very<00:02:15.390> short<00:02:15.630> intervals<00:02:16.079> and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
to the dust very short intervals and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.220 
to the dust very short intervals and
keep<00:02:16.709> pulling<00:02:17.099> along<00:02:17.540> keep<00:02:18.540> folding<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.200> down

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
keep pulling along keep folding it down

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.620 
keep pulling along keep folding it down
and<00:02:20.220> then<00:02:20.400> you've<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.359> end<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.569> our

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and then you've got to the end of our

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.870 
and then you've got to the end of our
device<00:02:21.950> as<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.340> see<00:02:23.459> there's<00:02:23.639> still<00:02:23.850> a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
device as you can see there's still a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.340 
device as you can see there's still a
few<00:02:24.209> little<00:02:24.329> air<00:02:24.569> bubbles<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.230> we're

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
few little air bubbles in there so we're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.569 
few little air bubbles in there so we're
just<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.620> take<00:02:25.739> our<00:02:25.889> applicator<00:02:26.280> card

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
just going to take our applicator card

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.640 
just going to take our applicator card
we're<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:27.420> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.569> smooth<00:02:27.900> those<00:02:28.049> out<00:02:28.290> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
we're just going to smooth those out so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.629 
we're just going to smooth those out so
I'm<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> push<00:02:29.670> them<00:02:29.910> along<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.870> device

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
I'm going to push them along the device

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.030 
I'm going to push them along the device
towards<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.790> end<00:02:33.319> as<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.380> can<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.739> those<00:02:34.889> are

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
towards the end as you can see those are

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:45.560 
towards the end as you can see those are
going<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> shift<00:02:35.700> along<00:02:36.060> quite<00:02:36.299> nicely

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570

so we got the vast majority of the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.620 
so we got the vast majority of the
vowels<00:02:47.740> out<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.100> source<00:02:48.670> few<00:02:49.270> small<00:02:49.480> ones
