improper fractions and mixed numbers for
example<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:02.280> wanted<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.790> change<00:02:04.280> 5/3<00:02:05.720> into

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
example if we wanted to change 5/3 into

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.520 
example if we wanted to change 5/3 into
a<00:02:07.939> mixed<00:02:08.939> number<00:02:10.280> 5/3<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.640> equal<00:02:12.299> to<00:02:13.160> 3/3<00:02:14.160> plus

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530

2/3
three<00:02:17.880> plus<00:02:18.150> two<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.420> five<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.230> five<00:02:19.470> thirds

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
three plus two is five so five thirds

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
three plus two is five so five thirds
well

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
well

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.880 
well
three<00:02:21.930> thirds<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:23.250> one<00:02:24.620> plus<00:02:25.850> two<00:02:26.850> thirds

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
three thirds is just one plus two thirds

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.140 
three thirds is just one plus two thirds
which<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.100> 1<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.820> 2/3<00:02:31.730> let's<00:02:32.730> look<00:02:32.880> at<00:02:33.000> one

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
which is 1 and 2/3 let's look at one

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.410 
which is 1 and 2/3 let's look at one
more

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
more

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.950

how<00:02:34.350> about<00:02:34.470> 9<00:02:34.830> fourths<00:02:37.910> nine<00:02:38.910> fourths<00:02:39.480> is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
how about 9 fourths nine fourths is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.790 
how about 9 fourths nine fourths is
equal<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.840> four<00:02:42.840> fourths<00:02:43.440> plus<00:02:45.470> well<00:02:46.470> actually

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
equal to four fourths plus well actually

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:56.450 
equal to four fourths plus well actually
it's<00:02:47.400> eight<00:02:48.210> fourths<00:02:49.020> plus<00:02:52.460> 1/4<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:55.460> 8

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
it's eight fourths plus 1/4 and 8

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:04.730 
it's eight fourths plus 1/4 and 8
divided<00:02:57.270> by<00:02:57.420> 4<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:58.260> 2<00:03:00.200> plus<00:03:01.200> 1/4<00:03:02.960> so<00:03:03.960> that's<00:03:04.170> 2

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
divided by 4 is 2 plus 1/4 so that's 2

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.600 
divided by 4 is 2 plus 1/4 so that's 2
and<00:03:05.240> 1/4<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.620> see<00:03:07.680> both<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.250> our

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
and 1/4 so as you can see both of our

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.640 
and 1/4 so as you can see both of our
improper<00:03:09.450> fractions<00:03:10.050> are<00:03:10.470> bigger<00:03:11.190> than<00:03:11.460> one

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
improper fractions are bigger than one

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.560 
improper fractions are bigger than one
but<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:13.740> can<00:03:13.890> also<00:03:14.070> take<00:03:14.430> our<00:03:14.730> mixed<00:03:15.210> number

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
but we can also take our mixed number

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.430 
but we can also take our mixed number
and<00:03:15.890> change<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.210> back<00:03:18.210> into<00:03:18.930> an<00:03:19.050> improper

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and change that back into an improper

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.620 
and change that back into an improper
fraction<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:21.150> let's<00:03:21.180> look<00:03:21.660> at<00:03:21.890> two<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.340> 3/8<00:03:26.630> 2

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
fraction so let's look at two and 3/8 2

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:40.820 
fraction so let's look at two and 3/8 2
is<00:03:29.360> 16<00:03:30.380> 8<00:03:32.360> 16<00:03:33.360> divided<00:03:33.810> by<00:03:33.840> 8<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.080> 2<00:03:35.090> plus<00:03:36.260> 3/8<00:03:39.830> we

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
is 16 8 16 divided by 8 is 2 plus 3/8 we

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.550 
is 16 8 16 divided by 8 is 2 plus 3/8 we
have<00:03:41.010> common<00:03:41.520> denominators<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:43.140> add<00:03:43.350> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
have common denominators so just add the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.200 
have common denominators so just add the
numerators<00:03:43.730> 16<00:03:44.730> plus<00:03:45.030> 3<00:03:45.240> is<00:03:45.510> 19<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:47.340> two<00:03:47.970> and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
numerators 16 plus 3 is 19 so two and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.650 
numerators 16 plus 3 is 19 so two and
3/8<00:03:48.630> would<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.680> 19<00:03:50.340> 8<00:03:50.610> as<00:03:50.970> an<00:03:51.300> improper

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
3/8 would be 19 8 as an improper

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:01.500 
3/8 would be 19 8 as an improper
fraction

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.569
