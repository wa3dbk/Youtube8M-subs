mechanism<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:47.220> mechanism

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
mechanism for that just that mechanism

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.780 
mechanism for that just that mechanism
see<00:02:49.020> goes<00:02:49.590> onto<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.040> wall<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.370> can't<00:02:50.610> pull

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790

in<00:03:32.689> the<00:03:32.930> Navy<00:03:33.230> let<00:03:33.469> the<00:03:33.620> Machine<00:03:34.269> some<00:03:35.269> candies

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:56.210 

so<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.130> wrap<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.490> guests<00:03:45.030> need<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.480> reload<00:03:45.840> this

all<00:03:56.760> right<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.410> me<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:58.800> machine<00:04:00.830> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
all right it is me like machine the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.910 
all right it is me like machine the
mechanism<00:04:02.430> no<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.050> me<00:04:04.230> myself<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
mechanism no this is not me myself and

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.550 
mechanism no this is not me myself and
pot<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.280> mean<00:04:06.050> last<00:04:07.050> two<00:04:07.290> engineers<00:04:07.710> mechanism

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
pot I mean last two engineers mechanism

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.100 
pot I mean last two engineers mechanism
shut<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.770> some<00:04:10.980> waiting<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:12.990> like

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
shut it get some waiting and it's like

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.650 
shut it get some waiting and it's like
the<00:04:13.230> best<00:04:13.380> i<00:04:13.560> could<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:15.120> see<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.420> orange

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
the best i could do you see that orange

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.550 
the best i could do you see that orange
piece<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:17.040> spin<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.730> just<00:04:17.760> hit<00:04:18.560> this

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
piece you spin it and it just hit this

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.340 
piece you spin it and it just hit this
thing<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.400> can't<00:04:20.670> twist<00:04:21.480> cuz

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
thing here and you can't twist cuz

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.460 
thing here and you can't twist cuz
that's<00:04:22.440> all<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.830> happened<00:04:23.160> when<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.400> twist

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that's all that happened when you twist

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.610 
that's all that happened when you twist
and<00:04:25.470> twist<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:26.190> knob<00:04:26.550> there<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:28.140> see<00:04:28.350> all

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
camera went into night vision there you

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.390 
camera went into night vision there you
go<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.260> now<00:04:37.260> only<00:04:37.470> princess<00:04:37.890> exist

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
go but you see now only princess exist

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.690 
go but you see now only princess exist
when<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.700> spin<00:04:38.940> up<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.300> nothing<00:04:40.140> happens<00:04:40.700> so

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
when you spin up and nothing happens so

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.870 
when you spin up and nothing happens so
when<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.450> get<00:04:42.660> money<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.620> put<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.800> in<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.760> the

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
when you get money and put it in to the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.840 
when you get money and put it in to the
slot<00:04:45.860> pushes

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.810 

pushes<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.270> piece<00:04:52.720> out<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.919> way<00:04:54.070> now<00:04:54.759> you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
pushes that piece out of the way now you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.320 
pushes that piece out of the way now you
have<00:04:55.030> freedom<00:04:55.449> of<00:04:55.810> motion<00:04:56.289> for<00:04:57.509> this<00:04:58.650> piece

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
have freedom of motion for this piece

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:08.070 
have freedom of motion for this piece
yeah<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:01.949> you<00:05:02.949> can<00:05:03.100> just<00:05:03.160> spin<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:07.080> drops

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
yeah so you can just spin it and drops

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.680 
yeah so you can just spin it and drops
and<00:05:08.770> then<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:10.080> go<00:05:11.080> today<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:13.300> there's<00:05:13.600> your

and then it go today and there's your

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.800 
and then it go today and there's your
candy<00:05:16.680> there<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:17.800> is<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:19.240> sorry<00:05:19.570> about<00:05:19.630> the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
candy there it is so sorry about the

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.909 
candy there it is so sorry about the
crappy<00:05:19.930> quality<00:05:20.229> of<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:20.710> video<00:05:21.150> will<00:05:22.150> be

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
crappy quality of this video will be

guys<00:05:25.990> enjoyed<00:05:26.470> this<00:05:26.710> candy<00:05:27.190> machine<00:05:27.520> anyways

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
guys enjoyed this candy machine anyways

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.980 
guys enjoyed this candy machine anyways
it<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:29.110> my<00:05:29.320> own<00:05:29.470> mechanism<00:05:30.340> but<00:05:30.580> got<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.300> idea

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
it is my own mechanism but got the idea

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.570 
it is my own mechanism but got the idea
to<00:05:32.080> use<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.590> spring<00:05:32.949> from<00:05:33.990> master<00:05:34.990> engineer

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
to use the spring from master engineer

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.920 
to use the spring from master engineer
but<00:05:36.580> this<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:36.820> not<00:05:36.940> his<00:05:37.120> mechanism<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.780> know

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
but this is not his mechanism you know

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.370 
but this is not his mechanism you know
put<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.289> coin<00:05:38.530> on<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.800> top<00:05:38.979> precious<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:40.750> you

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
put the coin on the top precious so you

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.339 
put the coin on the top precious so you
know<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.530> little<00:05:42.009> candy<00:05:42.610> machine<00:05:42.880> i<00:05:43.000> made<00:05:43.349> it

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
know a little candy machine i made it

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.159 
know a little candy machine i made it
didn't<00:05:44.680> take<00:05:44.800> very<00:05:44.830> long<00:05:45.630> quick<00:05:46.630> mechanism

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
didn't take very long quick mechanism

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.830 
didn't take very long quick mechanism
thought<00:05:47.349> of<00:05:47.530> so<00:05:48.430> that's<00:05:48.639> about<00:05:48.970> it<00:05:49.000> yes<00:05:49.539> next

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
thought of so that's about it yes next

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.990 
thought of so that's about it yes next
time<00:05:50.169> seems<00:05:50.919> like<00:05:51.070> this<00:05:51.190> video<00:05:51.460> comment<00:05:51.759> and

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
time seems like this video comment and
