it helps to turn with the hoop at this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.190 
it helps to turn with the hoop at this
point<00:01:25.910> don't<00:01:26.910> expect<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.420> move<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.870> happen

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
point don't expect this move to happen

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.740 
point don't expect this move to happen
straight<00:01:28.470> away<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:29.010> takes<00:01:29.430> time<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.850> practice

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.000 

another<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> lift<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> hoop<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> the

another way to lift the hoop to the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.040 
another way to lift the hoop to the
chest<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.850> arms<00:01:36.240> inside<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.660> hoop

chest is with the arms inside the hoop

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.140 
chest is with the arms inside the hoop
and<00:01:37.380> shimmy<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.560> hoop<00:01:40.800> lifts<00:01:41.310> by<00:01:41.820> shrugging

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and shimmy the hoop lifts by shrugging

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.500 
and shimmy the hoop lifts by shrugging
the<00:01:42.450> shoulders<00:01:42.480> evenly<00:01:43.410> from<00:01:43.650> side<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.040> side

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
the shoulders evenly from side to side

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.370 
the shoulders evenly from side to side
allowing<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.600> arms<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.260> draw<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> hoop<00:01:46.890> up

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
allowing the arms to draw the hoop up

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
allowing the arms to draw the hoop up
once<00:01:49.380> again<00:01:49.800> place<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.490> hoop<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> floor
