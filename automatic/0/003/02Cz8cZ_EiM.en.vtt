00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.770
 someone doesn't like her 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 completely unrealistic 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.380
 but she is just beautiful in history to people 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.360
 who once lived in this little but 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.579
 this no less cozy world had to 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.619
 build huge cubes and dive into 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 the sea to survive the apocalypse which 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.549
 threatened their planet but in fact it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.590
 was done so the church could 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.329
 manage people and in the course of passage 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 cards, we learn that no 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.969
 apocalypse was not their ancestors lived in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 cubes for hundreds of years only due to the fault of the church on 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.409
 the lower levels of the cube live the so-called 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.689
 the dregs of society are the people who do 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.119
 all the dirty work of living above 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.859
