do all that and so much more there are

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
do all that and so much more there are
just<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.140> many<00:00:25.170> gadgets<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> s500<00:00:26.970> l<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.539> we

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
just so many gadgets in the s500 l so we

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.000 
just so many gadgets in the s500 l so we
simply<00:00:28.080> couldn't<00:00:28.320> fit<00:00:28.529> them<00:00:28.560> into<00:00:28.859> a

simply couldn't fit them into a
three-minute<00:00:29.490> video<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.300> instead<00:00:30.869> we've

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
three-minute video so instead we've

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
three-minute video so instead we've

infrared camera located at the front of
the<00:00:46.590> car<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.039> monitor<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> road<00:00:47.879> ahead

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
the car to monitor the road ahead

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
the car to monitor the road ahead
another<00:00:49.050> cool<00:00:49.289> safety<00:00:49.559> system<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.280> called

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
another cool safety system is called

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.479 
another cool safety system is called
pre-safe<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> car<00:00:52.680> does<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.340> can

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
pre-safe what the car does is it can

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.850 
pre-safe what the car does is it can
actually<00:00:53.789> recognize<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.719> road<00:00:54.899> ahead<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
actually recognize the road ahead and it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.990 
actually recognize the road ahead and it
can<00:00:56.010> recognize<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
can recognize if you're going to have a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.840 
can recognize if you're going to have a
crash<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.680> system<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.280> tightens<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
crash so the system then tightens the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.689 
crash so the system then tightens the
seatbelts<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.020> close<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> sunroof

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
seatbelts it can close the sunroof

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.799 
seatbelts it can close the sunroof
closes<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> windows<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> basically

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
closes the windows and basically

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
closes the windows and basically
prepares<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> cabin<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:04.979> occupant<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
prepares the cabin an occupant for this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.500 
prepares the cabin an occupant for this
imminent<00:01:06.869> crash<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> driver<00:01:08.820> fails<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
imminent crash so if the driver fails to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.780 
imminent crash so if the driver fails to
react<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> imminent<00:01:10.590> collision<00:01:10.830> fails<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
react to the imminent collision fails to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
react to the imminent collision fails to
press<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> brake<00:01:12.299> pedal<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.990> car<00:01:13.229> will

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
press the brake pedal the car will

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.520 
press the brake pedal the car will
automatically<00:01:14.369> break<00:01:14.790> itself<00:01:15.229> blind<00:01:16.229> spot

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
automatically break itself blind spot

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
automatically break itself blind spot
assist<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.580> detect<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
assist can actually detect if there's a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
assist can actually detect if there's a
car<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.200> blind<00:01:19.380> spot<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
car in your blind spot it's a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
car in your blind spot it's a
radar-based<00:01:20.820> system<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.960> light<00:01:22.200> will

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
radar-based system that light will

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
radar-based system that light will
actually<00:01:22.830> flash<00:01:23.159> red<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> you'll<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.270> an

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
actually flash red and you'll get an

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.910 
actually flash red and you'll get an
audible<00:01:24.720> signal<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> remind<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
audible signal to remind you that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
audible signal to remind you that
there's<00:01:26.100> still<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.369> car<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.119> blind<00:01:27.390> spot

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
there's still a car in that blind spot

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
there's still a car in that blind spot
so<00:01:28.560> we've<00:01:28.710> already<00:01:28.890> covered<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> key

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
so we've already covered some of the key

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
so we've already covered some of the key
highlights<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.020> look<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.799> much

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
highlights but look there is so much

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580 
highlights but look there is so much
stuff<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.820> car<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.140> needing<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
actually go into this screen which has a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
actually go into this screen which has a
whole<00:01:43.590> heap<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:44.220> navigation<00:01:44.759> tabs

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
whole heap of different navigation tabs

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
whole heap of different navigation tabs
your<00:01:45.630> telephone<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> connects<00:01:46.860> directly

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
your telephone so it connects directly
