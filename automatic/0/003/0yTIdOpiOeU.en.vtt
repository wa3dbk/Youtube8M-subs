00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.940
 Hi everyone in this video I want 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.840
 let you see how to check it 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.250
 thickness and condition of the tablets 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.680
 of the disks 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.430
 sometimes this should be done 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.550
 I don't know every 10 15 thousand kilometers or 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.710
 whenever we notice something that does not 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.590
 I go into braking I do n't know rather than i 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.270
 noises etc. etc. 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.140
 in short, it does not give a controlled 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.760
 obviously to the braking system 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.120
 let's start with the pads and maybe the thing 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.130
 easier to control the control 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.490
 and it's very easy to see in the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.380
 thickness rotate the wheel slightly 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.000
 towards you so that the caliper point 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.320
 stand out and you must 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.270
 simply observe the thickness 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.720
 of the pads the one that is rotating 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.030
 and the disc immediately on the right is the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.560
 pastiglia on the right there is still precisely the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.829
 the iron support of the tablet 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.270
 and then we have the piston in here 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.870
 this case as you see the thickness of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.760
 around 45 mm to the eye and could 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.470
 keep going a little longer 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.950
 however you never go down to 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.270
 below saw 2 3 mm in short ok for 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.040
 regarding the control of the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.650
 thickness of the intel pads and that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.360
 that's all quite simple here 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.790
 you haven't seen then for how long 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.740
 regards the disks instead the speech is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.240
 slightly different then this too 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 case obviously control and visual 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.329
 we have to check 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.210
 this surface that in contact with 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.720
 the tablets and it must be so we say 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.890
 that is, it must be ok dug like in 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.079
 this case but we will go to so much 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.740
 changing these discs however does not have to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:04.500
 present too deep furrows o 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.600
 cracks or I don't know or a color a color 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 strange as if it were burned if you notice 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.810
 that is there is some anomaly for security 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.959
 disco goes and needs to be changed in other words for 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.739
 as for the thickness instead each 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.620
 manufacturer obviously indicates which 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.910
 is the minimum thickness indicates it on the disc 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.860
 itself and on which we do not read why 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.430
 all encrusted however on discs 9 then 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.930
 I will show you where it is written for 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.459
 check its thickness 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.370
 the easiest thing to do of course 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.810
 it's getting a caliber like this 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.630
 this very simple even in 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.730
 plastic can be found for a few euros and with 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.700
 this theme measures the thickness of the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.340
 disco is the most precise way if we want 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.100
 it's simpler to do it then 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.190
 let's open the caliber the position but 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.340
 around the disc and we press it there 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.470
 this step here that could go to 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.410
 offset measurement but gauge 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.359
 as you see it is done this way 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.769
 so he already has one himself 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.350
 space to let in the step 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.370
 so there is no problem in case there is not 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.650
 had 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.750
 we can go to the sea create us in the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.120
 space for example anyway we put it 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.860
 so we tighten it let's make sure that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.629
 be put well of course 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.900
 and then as you can see the measure is 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:25.230
 approximately 9 point point 2 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.640
 and then calculate the thickness 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.980
 minimum for this record was 10.2 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.849
 we are at nine points so we are 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.680
 even almost a millimeter below 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.620
 below the minimum allowed thickness e 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.859
 one should not go that far 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.170
 new these discs measure approximately 12 mm 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.799
 in fact already it was clear that he was a 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.569
 to change 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.030
 more or less how long they can last then 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.730
 we can tell the tablets the pads 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.650
 che va beh is a consumable 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.530
 so it depends a little on our style of 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.269
 guide by the quality of the pads from 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.730
 who roads we travel more than anything else 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.760
 so no system or city if we do 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.170
 more than anything else, extra-urban roads 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.140
 however broad line we can say 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.180
 that I don't know between 40 and 60 thousand 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.519
 so between 40 and 50 kilometers 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.090
 however I repeat it is a given enough 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.430
 even the discs are subjective, however i 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.460
 discs last longer than this machine 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.190
 Now it has 85 and goes toward the 90,000 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.639
 kilometers and are in fact to be changed 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.240
 but let's say that just 70 80 thousand 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.250
 kilometers you can safely 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.530
 make the hand disks that I put more or less 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.229
 every two changes of tablets then 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.370
 put the disc pad 9 changed 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.710
 once the tablets leave it 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.449
 same disc changed the second time 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.970
 the pads also changed the disc 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.919
 usually it is done so then I repeat from 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.449
 case by case then a should be done 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.610
 a bit more subjective speech 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.289
 this is the new disc and found here 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.780
 on the disc itself you find the writing 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.949
 minimulte cnes which means precisely 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.650
 minimum thickness and is indicated here 10.2 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.530
 mm and as you can see with the new disk 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.300
 we are on the 12 this instead the tablet 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.820
 new and you can notice with a thickness 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.740
 about a centimeter 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.020
 these were some tips for 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.610
 to measure 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.199
 and in short to check the state of the 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.050
 disc pads thank you 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.449
 of course the vision and I link to it 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.050
 guide for changing discs and 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.819
 tablets 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.819
 good vision next time
