we're<00:00:16.180> using<00:00:16.390> microfluidic<00:00:17.170> 'le<00:00:17.260> enabled

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
we're using microfluidic 'le enabled

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.440 
we're using microfluidic 'le enabled
high-throughput<00:00:18.400> single-cell<00:00:19.150> RNA

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
high-throughput single-cell RNA

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.510 
high-throughput single-cell RNA
sequencing<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:20.230> understand<00:00:20.680> how<00:00:20.890> population

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
sequencing to understand how population

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.150 
sequencing to understand how population
responses<00:00:22.060> are<00:00:22.240> mounted<00:00:22.690> and<00:00:22.810> coordinated<00:00:23.470> so

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
responses are mounted and coordinated so

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.920 
responses are mounted and coordinated so
we<00:00:24.820> took<00:00:25.000> some<00:00:25.180> immune<00:00:25.450> cells<00:00:25.689> that<00:00:25.840> we'd

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
we took some immune cells that we'd

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.420 
we took some immune cells that we'd
stimulated<00:00:26.410> with<00:00:26.500> different<00:00:26.740> pathogens<00:00:27.010> and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
stimulated with different pathogens and

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.060 
stimulated with different pathogens and
what<00:00:27.550> we<00:00:27.640> really<00:00:27.880> asked<00:00:28.180> is<00:00:28.300> how<00:00:29.110> how<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:30.040> a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
what we really asked is how how is a

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.950 
what we really asked is how how is a
dynamic<00:00:30.610> population<00:00:30.820> response<00:00:31.420> structured

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
dynamic population response structured

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.990 
dynamic population response structured
in<00:00:32.080> the<00:00:32.169> cells<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:32.529> comprise<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:33.910> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
in the cells that comprise it and so the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.369 
in the cells that comprise it and so the
paper<00:00:34.150> really<00:00:34.360> goes<00:00:34.629> into<00:00:34.900> looking<00:00:35.230> at

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
paper really goes into looking at

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.770 
paper really goes into looking at
changes<00:00:36.280> in<00:00:36.309> expression<00:00:36.910> over<00:00:37.000> time<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
changes in expression over time and the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.180 
changes in expression over time and the
ways<00:00:37.900> in<00:00:37.930> which<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.410> population<00:00:38.830> actually

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
ways in which the population actually

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.850 
ways in which the population actually
controls<00:00:39.820> those<00:00:40.090> changes<00:00:40.570> so<00:00:40.750> we<00:00:41.470> did<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> pilot

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
controls those changes so we did a pilot

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.549 
controls those changes so we did a pilot
about<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> year<00:00:42.520> ago<00:00:42.640> on<00:00:43.090> 18<00:00:43.570> cells<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.230> what<00:00:44.440> we

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
about a year ago on 18 cells and what we

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.130 
about a year ago on 18 cells and what we
were<00:00:44.680> able<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.920> show<00:00:45.129> is<00:00:45.280> that<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.780> we

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
were able to show is that actually we

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.500 
were able to show is that actually we
could<00:00:47.350> use<00:00:47.380> single-cell<00:00:48.250> RNA<00:00:48.820> sequencing<00:00:49.329> to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
could use single-cell RNA sequencing to

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.880 
could use single-cell RNA sequencing to
get<00:00:49.630> an<00:00:49.720> idea<00:00:49.989> of<00:00:50.079> what<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.350> difference<00:00:50.380> was

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
get an idea of what the difference was

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.799 
get an idea of what the difference was
between<00:00:50.950> cells<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.880> that<00:00:52.480> we<00:00:52.540> could<00:00:52.690> actually

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
between cells and that we could actually

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.900 
between cells and that we could actually
uncover<00:00:53.350> things<00:00:53.649> from<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.130> like<00:00:54.640> cell

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
uncover things from it like cell

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.479 
uncover things from it like cell
circuits<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.450> cell<00:00:55.600> states<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.920> at<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.250> time

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
circuits and cell states but at the time

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.220 
circuits and cell states but at the time
we've<00:00:58.000> been<00:00:58.030> limited<00:00:58.540> in<00:00:58.600> our<00:00:58.690> throughput<00:00:59.140> and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
we've been limited in our throughput and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.510 
we've been limited in our throughput and
we<00:00:59.320> really<00:00:59.559> couldn't<00:00:59.710> look<00:01:00.010> at<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.190> lot<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.370> the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
we really couldn't look at a lot of the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.979 
we really couldn't look at a lot of the
questions<00:01:00.969> that<00:01:01.030> we<00:01:01.210> were<00:01:01.270> interested<00:01:01.480> in<00:01:01.780> and

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
questions that we were interested in and

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.969 
questions that we were interested in and
we<00:01:02.829> were<00:01:03.760> lucky<00:01:03.910> enough<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.270> meet<00:01:04.570> up<00:01:04.720> with

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
we were lucky enough to meet up with

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.080 
we were lucky enough to meet up with
fluid<00:01:05.979> on<00:01:06.100> through<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.430> newly<00:01:06.700> founded

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
fluid on through the newly founded

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.910 
fluid on through the newly founded
single-cell<00:01:07.570> genomics<00:01:07.810> initiative<00:01:08.229> they

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
single-cell genomics initiative they

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.680 
single-cell genomics initiative they
developed<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.399> microfluidic<00:01:09.820> approach<00:01:10.420> that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
developed a microfluidic approach that

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.180 
developed a microfluidic approach that
would<00:01:10.780> help<00:01:10.899> us<00:01:11.050> with<00:01:11.259> preparing<00:01:11.740> single

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
would help us with preparing single

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.460 
would help us with preparing single
cells<00:01:12.369> for<00:01:12.550> sequencing<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.509> so<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:14.140> impetus

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
cells for sequencing and so the impetus

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.469 
cells for sequencing and so the impetus
was<00:01:14.649> really<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.670> knew<00:01:15.850> we<00:01:16.000> wanted<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.300> do

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
was really that we knew we wanted to do

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.180 
was really that we knew we wanted to do
this<00:01:16.600> but<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.899> technology<00:01:17.530> emerged<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.130> it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
this but the technology emerged and it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.029 
this but the technology emerged and it
was<00:01:18.399> a<00:01:18.700> melding<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.420> minds<00:01:19.800> so<00:01:20.800> really

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
was a melding of the minds so really

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.859 
was a melding of the minds so really
what<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.490> paper<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.880> about<00:01:21.940> it's<00:01:22.720> about

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
what the paper is about it's about

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.020 
what the paper is about it's about
showing<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.619> lot<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.190> behaviors<00:01:24.280> that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
showing that a lot of the behaviors that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.050 
showing that a lot of the behaviors that
emerge<00:01:25.810> in<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.170> multicellular<00:01:26.670> population<00:01:27.670> are

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
emerge in a multicellular population are

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.639 
emerge in a multicellular population are
the<00:01:28.270> results<00:01:28.690> of<00:01:28.780> communication<00:01:29.530> between

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
the results of communication between

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.100 
the results of communication between
cells<00:01:30.069> and<00:01:30.399> so<00:01:31.179> I<00:01:31.450> think<00:01:31.810> what's<00:01:31.959> interesting

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
cells and so I think what's interesting

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.230 
cells and so I think what's interesting
about<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.649> is<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:33.069> certain<00:01:33.670> population

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
about it is that certain population

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.419 
about it is that certain population
behaviors<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.619> we<00:01:35.709> think<00:01:35.920> are<00:01:36.039> really

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
behaviors the that we think are really

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.880 
behaviors the that we think are really
important<00:01:36.880> they're<00:01:37.000> actually<00:01:37.509> emerging<00:01:38.080> from

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
important they're actually emerging from

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.609 
important they're actually emerging from
the<00:01:39.250> decisions<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.060> remote<00:01:40.599> population<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
the decisions of a remote population of

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.380 
the decisions of a remote population of
cells<00:01:41.800> because<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.580> early<00:01:42.789> responders<00:01:43.149> are

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
cells because the early responders are

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.139 
cells because the early responders are
actually<00:01:44.310> initiating<00:01:45.310> an<00:01:45.520> antiviral

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
actually initiating an antiviral

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually initiating an antiviral
response<00:01:46.479> in<00:01:46.599> ourselves<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:47.110> turning<00:01:47.440> off

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
response in ourselves and turning off

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.040 
response in ourselves and turning off
inflammation<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.819> our<00:01:48.970> limited<00:01:49.420> population

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
inflammation and our limited population

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.139 
inflammation and our limited population
of<00:01:50.140> cells<00:01:50.429> what<00:01:51.429> we've<00:01:51.580> discovered<00:01:51.880> that's

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
of cells what we've discovered that's

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.749 
of cells what we've discovered that's
interesting<00:01:52.599> is<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:53.039> this<00:01:54.039> percentage<00:01:54.550> of

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
interesting is that this percentage of

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.949 
interesting is that this percentage of
cells<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.240> can<00:01:55.330> actually<00:01:55.450> generate<00:01:55.810> this

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
cells that can actually generate this

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.839 
cells that can actually generate this
response<00:01:56.319> to<00:01:56.440> be<00:01:56.530> very<00:01:56.740> important<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.700> if<00:01:57.759> you

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
response to be very important so if you

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:59.070 
response to be very important so if you
don't<00:01:58.030> have<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.300> right<00:01:58.479> number<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.869> these

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
don't have the right number of these

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.290 
don't have the right number of these
cells<00:01:59.349> you<00:01:59.649> actually<00:02:00.520> won't<00:02:00.700> be<00:02:00.819> able<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.090> trap

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
cells you actually won't be able to trap

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.880 
cells you actually won't be able to trap
inflammation<00:02:01.959> which<00:02:02.140> could<00:02:02.319> lead<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.500> disease

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
inflammation which could lead to disease

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.350 
inflammation which could lead to disease
and<00:02:03.099> if<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.369> too<00:02:03.580> many<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:04.030> might<00:02:04.149> not

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
and if you have too many you might not

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.570 
and if you have too many you might not
have<00:02:04.630> sufficient<00:02:04.899> inflammation<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.190> what

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
have sufficient inflammation so what

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.540 
have sufficient inflammation so what
what<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.119> real<00:02:07.270> takeaway<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.780> me<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
what the real takeaway to me is is that

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.430 
what the real takeaway to me is is that
we<00:02:10.030> need<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.209> start<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.599> think<00:02:10.660> about<00:02:10.840> balance

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
we need to start to think about balance

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.020 
we need to start to think about balance
and<00:02:11.680> how<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.800> interaction<00:02:12.489> between<00:02:12.520> cells

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and how the interaction between cells

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.699 
and how the interaction between cells
actually<00:02:13.390> drives<00:02:13.780> things<00:02:14.140> at<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.319> systems

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
actually drives things at a systems

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.530 
actually drives things at a systems
level<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.580> sometimes<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.209> we<00:02:16.330> have

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
level and that sometimes when we have

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
level and that sometimes when we have
disease<00:02:16.989> phenotypes<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.890> might<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.250> be

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
disease phenotypes it it might not be

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.729 
disease phenotypes it it might not be
because<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.000> circuit<00:02:19.420> within<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.810> cell<00:02:20.050> it

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
because of a circuit within a cell it

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.559 
because of a circuit within a cell it
could<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.069> because<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.489> circuit<00:02:21.910> between<00:02:22.030> cells

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
it and what we've really done is we've

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.040 
it and what we've really done is we've

be important I hope that at the very

be important I hope that at the very

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
in order to do this will be generally

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.949 
in order to do this will be generally
applicable<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:57.120> think<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.480> next<00:02:58.750> steps

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.720 
applicable I think that the next steps
in<00:02:59.260> this<00:02:59.620> line<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.830> research<00:03:00.099> are<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.549> move

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
in this line of research are to move

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.220 
in this line of research are to move
beyond<00:03:01.090> sort<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.390> these<00:03:01.540> simple<00:03:01.930> model

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
great model so post mitotic they have

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.380 
great model so post mitotic they have
good<00:03:11.200> stimuli<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:11.819> bacterial<00:03:12.819> components
