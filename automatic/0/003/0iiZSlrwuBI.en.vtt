00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
stick to a hex dumbbell to add a little

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.470 
stick to a hex dumbbell to add a little
bit<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.160> weight<00:00:17.400> basically<00:00:17.760> micro<00:00:18.270> load

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
bit of weight basically micro load

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.390 
bit of weight basically micro load
without<00:00:18.690> having<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.619> whole<00:00:20.189> nother

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
without having to have a whole nother

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.490 
without having to have a whole nother
set<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.820> dumbbells<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.900> if<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.230> wanted

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
set of dumbbells so if you just wanted

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.009 
set of dumbbells so if you just wanted
to<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.949> by<00:00:23.310> two<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.330> half<00:00:24.449> pounds<00:00:24.930> you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to go up by two and a half pounds you

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.800 
to go up by two and a half pounds you
could<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.830> take<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.369> weight<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.090> stick

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
could you know take a weight and stick

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
could you know take a weight and stick
it<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> side<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> dumbbell<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it on to the side of the dumbbell and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.040 
it on to the side of the dumbbell and
just<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.750> by<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> increment<00:00:32.750> what<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> did

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
just go up by that increment what I did

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.069 
just go up by that increment what I did
here<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.590> took<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.540> standard<00:00:36.540> Olympic

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here is I just took a standard Olympic

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
here is I just took a standard Olympic
weight<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.190> happens<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.579> weigh<00:00:39.059> three

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
weight this one happens to weigh three

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.270 
weight this one happens to weigh three
pounds<00:00:39.840> even<00:00:40.050> though<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> says<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.590> 200<00:00:41.719> 2.75

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
pounds even though it says it's 200 2.75

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
pounds even though it says it's 200 2.75
so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.399> got<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.719> those<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.860> strong

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
so I got some of those really strong

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
so I got some of those really strong
magnets<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> internet

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
magnets that you can get on the internet

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
magnets that you can get on the internet
I<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.829> got<00:00:50.129> these<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.460> Amazon<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> got

something like that and then I had a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.200 
something like that and then I had a
standard<00:00:57.539> iron<00:00:57.660> plate<00:00:58.079> laying<00:00:58.320> around<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
standard iron plate laying around I

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.380 
standard iron plate laying around I
roughed<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.260> side<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.890> plate<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:03.120> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
roughed up the side of the plate that I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.350 
roughed up the side of the plate that I
wanted<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> stick<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> magnet<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.700> iron

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
wanted to stick the magnet to with iron

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
wanted to stick the magnet to with iron
file<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.710> used<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.250> stuff<00:01:08.549> called

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
file and then I used this stuff called

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
file and then I used this stuff called
jb<00:01:09.810> weld<00:01:10.159> which<00:01:11.159> i<00:01:11.280> found<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> website<00:01:12.470> but

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
jb weld which i found on a website but

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
jb weld which i found on a website but
you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.280> pretty<00:01:14.580> much<00:01:14.610> any<00:01:14.820> like

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you can get it at pretty much any like

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
you can get it at pretty much any like
Home<00:01:15.420> Depot<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.960> Lowe's<00:01:16.009> hardware<00:01:17.009> store<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
Home Depot or Lowe's hardware store and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
Home Depot or Lowe's hardware store and
it's<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.420> those<00:01:18.540> epoxies<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it's of one of those epoxies where you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's of one of those epoxies where you
mix<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:19.950> together<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.979> creates<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
mix the two together and it creates a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.570 
mix the two together and it creates a
bond<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.390> strong<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.140> steel

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
bond that's pretty much strong as steel

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.999 
bond that's pretty much strong as steel
or<00:01:26.580> close<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> roughed<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> side<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
or close and I roughed up the side of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.770 
or close and I roughed up the side of
the<00:01:29.070> magnet<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> roughed<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> side<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the magnet and roughed up the side of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
the magnet and roughed up the side of
the<00:01:30.869> plate<00:01:31.310> applied<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> jb<00:01:32.820> weld<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.479> then

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the plate applied the jb weld and then

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
the plate applied the jb weld and then
applied<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.900> magnet<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.280> let<00:01:35.490> them<00:01:35.610> sit

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
applied the magnet and just let them sit

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.440 
applied the magnet and just let them sit
for<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.299> day<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> end<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.520> these<00:01:39.390> two

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
for a day and you end up with these two

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230 
for a day and you end up with these two
magnets<00:01:39.960> each<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.220> something<00:01:42.030> like

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
magnets each I think have something like

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.010 
magnets each I think have something like
26<00:01:42.750> pounds<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.470> pulling<00:01:44.130> force<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
26 pounds of pulling force so if you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.039 
26 pounds of pulling force so if you
take<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:47.420> weight<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.960> stick<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:51.049> hex

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
take the weight and stick it to a hex

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.069 
take the weight and stick it to a hex
dumbbell<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.299> stick<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> any<00:01:54.840> hex

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
dumbbell you can stick it to any hex

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.889 
dumbbell you can stick it to any hex
dumbbell<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.770> any<00:01:55.920> plate<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:57.149> use<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
dumbbell or to any plate and then use it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
dumbbell or to any plate and then use it
just<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.219> works<00:01:59.369> better<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
just like that it works better with the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.209 
just like that it works better with the
bigger<00:02:00.240> dumbbells<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> use

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
bigger dumbbells but I think if you use

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.190 
bigger dumbbells but I think if you use
a<00:02:02.960> standard<00:02:03.960> weight<00:02:04.799> plate<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.850> could

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
a standard weight plate you could

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.150 
a standard weight plate you could
probably<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> baguettes<00:02:07.860> closer

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
probably put the baguettes closer

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160 
probably put the baguettes closer
together<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:08.910> use<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> smaller

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
together and then use it on a smaller

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
together and then use it on a smaller
DUMBO

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
DUMBO

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.339 
DUMBO
so<00:02:11.909> you<00:02:11.970> want<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.360> make<00:02:12.480> sure<00:02:12.659> that<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.230> know

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
so you want to make sure that you know

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.899 
so you want to make sure that you know
that<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> weight<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.040> kind<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.370> centered<00:02:14.700> so

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
that the weight is kind of centered so

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.020 
that the weight is kind of centered so
that<00:02:15.060> both<00:02:15.330> magnets<00:02:15.989> are<00:02:16.640> gripping<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> plate

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that both magnets are gripping the plate

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.309 
that both magnets are gripping the plate
and<00:02:18.269> then<00:02:19.080> once<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.069> have<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:21.319> move

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
and then once you have it on there move

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.190 
and then once you have it on there move
it<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:23.000> once<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
it out once you have it on there the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.650 
it out once you have it on there the
weights<00:02:25.440> actually<00:02:25.680> pretty<00:02:26.190> strong<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.000> can

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
weights actually pretty strong you can

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.199 
weights actually pretty strong you can
shake<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:29.310> won't<00:02:29.549> come<00:02:29.700> off

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
shake it and it won't come off

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.660 
shake it and it won't come off
so<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.959> mean<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> should<00:02:31.799> be<00:02:31.860> easily<00:02:32.069> strong

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
so I mean so it should be easily strong

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.740 
so I mean so it should be easily strong
enough<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.090> do<00:02:33.239> curls<00:02:34.170> or<00:02:34.970> even<00:02:35.970> overhead

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
enough to do curls or even overhead

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.800 
enough to do curls or even overhead
movements<00:02:37.410> without<00:02:37.829> falling<00:02:38.430> off<00:02:38.579> so<00:02:39.030> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
movements without falling off so a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.539 
movements without falling off so a
pretty<00:02:40.530> decent<00:02:40.890> way<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.010> make<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:42.140> think

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
pretty decent way to make them I think

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.080 
pretty decent way to make them I think
overall<00:02:44.690> probably<00:02:45.690> only<00:02:45.989> costs<00:02:46.410> yeah<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.670> mean

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
overall probably only costs yeah I mean

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.250 
overall probably only costs yeah I mean
depending<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.450> what<00:02:48.569> materials<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.109> have

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
depending on what materials you have

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.710 
depending on what materials you have
around<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> house<00:02:49.849> buying<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.030> magnets<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
around the house buying the magnets and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.170 
around the house buying the magnets and
then<00:02:51.840> buying<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.260> JV<00:02:52.590> weld<00:02:52.879> you<00:02:53.879> know<00:02:53.970> less

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
then buying the JV weld you know less

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080 
then buying the JV weld you know less
than<00:02:54.209> 20<00:02:54.720> bucks<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.650> could<00:02:55.890> make<00:02:56.160> several

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
than 20 bucks and you could make several

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.479 
than 20 bucks and you could make several
plate<00:02:57.540> mates<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.099> plate<00:02:59.220> mates

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
plate mates for it and the plate mates

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.599 
plate mates for it and the plate mates
themselves<00:03:00.030> cost<00:03:00.720> quite<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> bit<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.609> anyway

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
themselves cost quite a bit so anyway

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.710 
themselves cost quite a bit so anyway
just<00:03:02.879> an<00:03:02.970> idea

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
just an idea

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.579 
just an idea
do-it-yourself<00:03:04.319> idea<00:03:04.950> Thanks
