designed for an aerobic activities not
aerobic<00:03:43.360> activities<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.860> we<00:03:45.550> focus<00:03:45.940> on<00:03:46.120> that

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
aerobic activities so we focus on that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.060 
aerobic activities so we focus on that
and<00:03:46.510> as<00:03:46.630> they<00:03:46.780> get<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.959> little<00:03:47.050> older<00:03:47.350> twelve

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.920 
and as they get a little older twelve
thirteen<00:03:48.790> then<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.180> start<00:03:49.450> opening<00:03:49.780> the
