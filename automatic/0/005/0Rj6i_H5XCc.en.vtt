powers i think there's going to be like
a<00:01:47.350> apart<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:48.070> don't<00:01:48.189> think<00:01:48.310> they're<00:01:48.400> going<00:01:48.490> to

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
a apart I don't think they're going to

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.340 
a apart I don't think they're going to
do<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.970> lightning<00:01:49.600> bolt<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.930> his<00:01:50.049> chest

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
do like the lightning bolt to his chest

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.010 
do like the lightning bolt to his chest
or<00:01:50.770> do<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.610> magic<00:01:51.790> way<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:52.450> like<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.810> god<00:01:52.990> of

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
or do the magic way with like the god of

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.300 
or do the magic way with like the god of
mercury<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.560> think<00:01:53.860> they're<00:01:53.979> going<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.189> be

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
mercury I think they're going to be

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.450 
mercury I think they're going to be
doing<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.670> STAR<00:01:55.030> Labs<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.100> flash

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
doing a STAR Labs I think the flash

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.600 
doing a STAR Labs I think the flash
Barry<00:01:57.880> Allen<00:01:58.689> will<00:01:58.899> be<00:01:59.020> working<00:01:59.590> at<00:02:00.009> STAR<00:02:00.579> Labs

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
Barry Allen will be working at STAR Labs

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.120 
Barry Allen will be working at STAR Labs
while<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.450> particle<00:02:01.899> accelerator<00:02:02.130> explodes

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
while the particle accelerator explodes

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.100 
while the particle accelerator explodes
and<00:02:03.549> that's<00:02:03.700> how<00:02:03.880> he'll<00:02:04.060> gain<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.450> powers<00:02:04.840> of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
and that's how he'll gain the powers of

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.920 
and that's how he'll gain the powers of
the<00:02:05.310> flash<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.759> I<00:02:07.060> think<00:02:07.329> that's<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.780> pretty

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
the flash and I think that's a pretty

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.389 
the flash and I think that's a pretty
interesting<00:02:08.170> thing<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:08.649> like<00:02:08.950> they're

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
interesting thing because like they're

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.319 
interesting thing because like they're
trying<00:02:09.549> to<00:02:09.729> say<00:02:09.820> that<00:02:09.970> there's<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.299> be

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
trying to say that there's going to be

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.720 
trying to say that there's going to be
one<00:02:10.660> big<00:02:10.989> thing<00:02:11.019> that<00:02:11.530> like<00:02:11.980> gives<00:02:12.250> powers

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
one big thing that like gives powers

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.390 
one big thing that like gives powers
into<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.180> universe<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.959> think<00:02:14.019> that's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
into this universe and I think that's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
into this universe and I think that's
basically<00:02:15.400> STAR<00:02:15.849> Labs<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:16.510> know<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.900> in

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
basically STAR Labs you know like in

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.530 
basically STAR Labs you know like in
Smallville<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> star<00:02:18.430> last<00:02:18.640> like

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
Smallville the star last like

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.449 
Smallville the star last like
mutated<00:02:20.079> people<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.500> give<00:02:20.620> them<00:02:20.769> powers<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.400> I

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
mutated people to give them powers and I

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.490 
mutated people to give them powers and I
think<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.879> just<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:22.150> okay<00:02:22.450> STAR<00:02:23.079> Labs<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.469> a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
think it's just like okay STAR Labs is a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.319 
think it's just like okay STAR Labs is a
normal<00:02:23.859> place<00:02:24.099> working<00:02:24.489> on<00:02:24.730> like<00:02:24.879> human

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
normal place working on like human

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.339 
normal place working on like human
genetics<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:27.420> particle<00:02:28.420> accelerator<00:02:28.480> went

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
genetics and a particle accelerator went

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.890 
genetics and a particle accelerator went
off<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.939> Barry<00:02:30.939> Allen<00:02:31.239> was<00:02:31.359> working<00:02:31.689> there

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
off and Barry Allen was working there

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
off and Barry Allen was working there
and<00:02:32.459> there<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.549> go<00:02:33.579> like<00:02:34.060> he's<00:02:34.269> faster<00:02:34.719> than

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and there you go like he's faster than

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.770 
and there you go like he's faster than
speed<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.069> light<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:37.090> think<00:02:37.390> that's<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.629> good

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
speed of light and I think that's a good

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.960 
speed of light and I think that's a good
way<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:37.930> him<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.200> give<00:02:38.349> his<00:02:38.439> powers<00:02:38.829> overall<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
way for him to give his powers overall I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.330 
way for him to give his powers overall I
just<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.989> don't<00:02:41.170> know<00:02:41.319> how<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> can't<00:02:42.159> even

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
just I don't know how I can't even

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.160 
just I don't know how I can't even
imagine<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.849> episode<00:02:43.329> happening<00:02:43.780> my<00:02:43.930> guess

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
imagine the episode happening my guess

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.229 
imagine the episode happening my guess
is<00:02:44.439> Oliver<00:02:45.280> Queen<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.519> going<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.849> visit<00:02:46.120> his

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
is Oliver Queen is going to visit his

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.520 
is Oliver Queen is going to visit his
mother<00:02:46.389> at<00:02:46.629> iron<00:02:46.900> Heights<00:02:47.079> because<00:02:47.349> iron

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
mother at iron Heights because iron

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.009 
mother at iron Heights because iron
Heights<00:02:47.829> is<00:02:47.950> very<00:02:48.129> close<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.810> central<00:02:49.810> city

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
Heights is very close to a central city

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.379 
Heights is very close to a central city
where<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.349> flash<00:02:50.620> lives<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.609> think<00:02:51.849> what's

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
where the flash lives so I think what's

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.449 
where the flash lives so I think what's
gonna<00:02:52.480> happen<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.959> okay<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.349> arrow<00:02:53.829> visit<00:02:54.340> his

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
gonna happen is okay so arrow visit his

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.699 
gonna happen is okay so arrow visit his
mother<00:02:54.609> and<00:02:54.849> iron<00:02:55.030> Heights<00:02:55.359> he's<00:02:56.049> while<00:02:56.530> he's

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
mother and iron Heights he's while he's

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.559 
mother and iron Heights he's while he's
visiting<00:02:57.069> there<00:02:57.310> he<00:02:57.519> decides<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:57.970> go<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.329> town

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
visiting there he decides to go in town

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.140 
visiting there he decides to go in town
for<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.870> little<00:02:58.930> bit<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.560> maybe<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:00.519> check<00:03:00.879> to

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
for a little bit and maybe just check to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.970 
for a little bit and maybe just check to
check<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.419> see<00:03:01.569> what's<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:02.019> on<00:03:02.200> while<00:03:02.950> he's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
check to see what's going on while he's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.520 
check to see what's going on while he's
in<00:03:03.340> town<00:03:03.519> that<00:03:04.419> is<00:03:04.659> when<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.139> particle

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
in town that is when the particle

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.199 
in town that is when the particle
accelerator<00:03:05.590> explodes<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.639> next<00:03:07.060> hole

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
accelerator explodes and next hole

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.080 
accelerator explodes and next hole
explosion<00:03:07.599> happened<00:03:08.349> and<00:03:08.530> Oliver<00:03:08.919> Queen<00:03:09.790> puts

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
explosion happened and Oliver Queen puts

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.759 
explosion happened and Oliver Queen puts
all<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.419> know<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.689> arrow<00:03:10.840> costume<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.739> go

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
all you know the arrow costume and go

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.830 
all you know the arrow costume and go
see<00:03:12.250> what's<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.819> see<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.389> oh<00:03:13.599> what's

going on and the ads everything as he's

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.039 
going on and the ads everything as he's
at<00:03:17.139> STAR<00:03:17.620> Labs<00:03:17.650> he<00:03:18.459> runs<00:03:18.730> into<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.329> flash<00:03:19.689> were

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
at STAR Labs he runs into the flash were

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.960 
at STAR Labs he runs into the flash were
right<00:03:20.590> now<00:03:20.739> Barry<00:03:21.010> Allen<00:03:21.220> has<00:03:21.400> no<00:03:21.609> clue<00:03:21.790> what's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
right now Barry Allen has no clue what's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.280 
right now Barry Allen has no clue what's
going<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:22.269> he<00:03:22.389> doesn't<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:22.870> he's<00:03:23.019> like<00:03:23.109> oh

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
going on he doesn't like he's like oh

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.250 
going on he doesn't like he's like oh
shit<00:03:23.349> like<00:03:24.239> I'm<00:03:25.239> running<00:03:25.419> faster<00:03:25.900> than<00:03:26.019> us

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
shit like I'm running faster than us

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.500 
shit like I'm running faster than us
everything<00:03:26.949> like<00:03:27.129> and<00:03:27.370> basically<00:03:28.120> Oliver

man alive I think you can give girl have
some<00:05:29.950> screaming<00:05:30.430> powers<00:05:30.730> like<00:05:31.000> really<00:05:31.330> the

some screaming powers like really the

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.360 
some screaming powers like really the
only<00:05:32.080> reason<00:05:32.530> I<00:05:32.620> think<00:05:32.800> they<00:05:32.860> didn't<00:05:33.100> do<00:05:33.220> that

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
only reason I think they didn't do that

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.670 
only reason I think they didn't do that
is<00:05:33.610> maybe<00:05:34.270> they're<00:05:34.540> hiding<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:35.080> maybe<00:05:35.290> she<00:05:35.560> was

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
is maybe they're hiding it maybe she was

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.140 
is maybe they're hiding it maybe she was
like<00:05:35.830> doesn't<00:05:36.190> want<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.400> show<00:05:36.550> people<00:05:36.580> she<00:05:37.030> has

like doesn't want to show people she has

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.480 
like doesn't want to show people she has
to<00:05:37.270> power<00:05:37.450> because<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:38.530> think<00:05:38.980> they<00:05:39.220> wanted

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
to power because I think they wanted

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.850 
to power because I think they wanted
they<00:05:39.730> hbu<00:05:40.090> powers<00:05:40.660> into<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:40.960> universe<00:05:41.320> like
