so<00:00:41.530> I<00:00:41.560> hope<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.010> enjoyed<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.370> nice<00:00:42.850> little

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
so I hope you enjoyed that nice little

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.910 
so I hope you enjoyed that nice little
cinematic<00:00:43.450> that<00:00:43.780> prepared<00:00:44.110> for<00:00:44.290> you<00:00:44.350> guys<00:00:44.560> it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
cinematic that prepared for you guys it

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.770 
cinematic that prepared for you guys it
pretty<00:00:45.130> much<00:00:45.220> does<00:00:45.880> some<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:46.420> thing<00:00:46.630> up

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
pretty much does some this thing up

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.760 
pretty much does some this thing up
pretty<00:00:47.080> well<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:47.950> yeah<00:00:48.670> it's<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:49.059> 3<00:00:49.360> by<00:00:49.570> 4<00:00:50.410> by<00:00:50.739> 3

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
pretty well so yeah it's a 3 by 4 by 3

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
pretty well so yeah it's a 3 by 4 by 3
or<00:00:51.280> 4<00:00:52.059> x<00:00:52.239> 3<00:00:52.450> x<00:00:52.480> 3<00:00:52.630> it's<00:00:53.440> incredibly<00:00:54.250> small<00:00:54.580> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
or 4 x 3 x 3 it's incredibly small and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280 
or 4 x 3 x 3 it's incredibly small and
this<00:00:56.170> thing<00:00:56.350> can<00:00:56.559> count<00:00:56.770> up<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.010> 48<00:00:57.580> hours<00:00:58.290> yep

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
this thing can count up to 48 hours yep

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.939 
this thing can count up to 48 hours yep
I<00:00:59.730> am<00:01:00.730> truly<00:01:01.059> amazed<00:01:01.510> with<00:01:01.930> this<00:01:02.290> build<00:01:02.530> it's

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
I am truly amazed with this build it's

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.270 
I am truly amazed with this build it's
incredible<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.260> how<00:01:05.770> does<00:01:05.830> this<00:01:05.979> thing<00:01:06.100> work

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
incredible so how does this thing work

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.609 
incredible so how does this thing work
so<00:01:07.060> as<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.479> can<00:01:07.570> see<00:01:07.720> in<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.900> Spencer<00:01:08.350> we<00:01:08.500> have

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
so as you can see in the Spencer we have

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.430 
so as you can see in the Spencer we have
got<00:01:08.830> stacks<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.400> items<00:01:09.820> now<00:01:10.660> in<00:01:11.020> case<00:01:11.290> you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
got stacks of items now in case you

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.590 
got stacks of items now in case you
didn't<00:01:11.619> know<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.979> takes<00:01:12.399> five<00:01:12.820> minutes<00:01:13.090> for<00:01:13.509> an

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
didn't know it takes five minutes for an

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.230 
didn't know it takes five minutes for an
item<00:01:13.750> entities<00:01:14.530> despawn<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.460> when<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.119> be

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
item entities despawn and when it be

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.290 
item entities despawn and when it be
spawns<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.899> can<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.890> know<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.970> know<00:01:19.060> Matt

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
spawns it can you know you know Matt

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.639 
spawns it can you know you know Matt
pretty<00:01:19.810> much<00:01:19.899> activate<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.560> deactivate

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
pretty much activate and deactivate

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.740 
pretty much activate and deactivate
wouldn't<00:01:21.280> pressure<00:01:21.399> play<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:22.420> that's<00:01:22.540> how<00:01:22.600> it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
wouldn't pressure play so that's how it

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.440 
wouldn't pressure play so that's how it
works<00:01:22.960> under<00:01:23.950> here<00:01:24.280> there<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.759> torch<00:01:25.119> that

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
works under here there is a torch that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.749 
works under here there is a torch that
is<00:01:25.509> getting<00:01:25.780> powered<00:01:26.470> by<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.220> pressure<00:01:27.580> plate

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
is getting powered by the pressure plate

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.440 
is getting powered by the pressure plate
so<00:01:28.720> when<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:29.530> item<00:01:29.710> D<00:01:29.979> spawns<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.729> will<00:01:31.030> turn

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
so when this item D spawns it will turn

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.800 
so when this item D spawns it will turn
the<00:01:31.600> torch<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.350> will<00:01:32.530> fire<00:01:32.800> another<00:01:33.250> item

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the torch on and will fire another item

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.930 
the torch on and will fire another item
so<00:01:34.810> whenever<00:01:35.200> an<00:01:35.530> item<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.190> on<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.759> pressure

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
so whenever an item is on the pressure

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.920 
so whenever an item is on the pressure
plate<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.840> piston<00:01:38.289> here<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.710> refracted<00:01:39.250> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
plate this piston here is refracted and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.480 
plate this piston here is refracted and
when<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.020> item<00:01:41.110> these<00:01:41.440> bonds<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:41.979> extends

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
when the item these bonds it extends

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
when the item these bonds it extends
piston<00:01:42.970> sends<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.869> pulse<00:01:44.080> around<00:01:44.500> here<00:01:45.010> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
piston sends a pulse around here and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
piston sends a pulse around here and
we'll<00:01:46.780> get<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.080> hear<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:50.080> takes

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
we'll get to hear but because it takes

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.700 
we'll get to hear but because it takes
around<00:01:51.549> about<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.880> second<00:01:52.420> for<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.900> item<00:01:53.680> to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
around about a second for the item to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.469 
around about a second for the item to
get<00:01:54.040> shot<00:01:54.310> out<00:01:54.340> again<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:54.970> back<00:01:55.119> onto<00:01:55.330> the

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
get shot out again and back onto the

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.840 
get shot out again and back onto the
pressure<00:01:55.689> plate<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.680> piston<00:01:57.070> retracts<00:01:57.520> which

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
pressure plate the piston retracts which

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.570 
pressure plate the piston retracts which
means<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.420> output<00:01:58.750> will<00:01:58.869> not<00:01:59.049> turn<00:01:59.259> on

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
means that the output will not turn on

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.149 
means that the output will not turn on
so<00:02:00.580> if<00:02:00.939> we<00:02:01.150> take<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.689> all<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.530> these<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.610> one

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so if we take out all of these but one

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.340 
so if we take out all of these but one
like<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:06.369> we<00:02:06.549> only<00:02:06.640> got<00:02:06.759> one<00:02:06.909> item<00:02:07.270> left<00:02:07.509> you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
like that we only got one item left you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.440 
like that we only got one item left you
can<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:09.009> if<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.459> somehow<00:02:09.790> grab<00:02:10.269> this

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
can see that if we somehow grab this

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.569 
can see that if we somehow grab this
item<00:02:10.899> if<00:02:11.769> we<00:02:11.890> go<00:02:12.100> under<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:14.310> did<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.430> get<00:02:15.519> it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
item if we go under here did we get it

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.420 
item if we go under here did we get it
we<00:02:15.850> didn't<00:02:16.360> get<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.680> okay<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:18.070> don't<00:02:18.310> know<00:02:18.370> how

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
we didn't get it okay I don't know how

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.319 
we didn't get it okay I don't know how
to<00:02:18.489> grab<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:21.100> can<00:02:21.220> see<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.489> mean<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
to grab this you can see what I mean the

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.140 
to grab this you can see what I mean the
piston<00:02:22.870> retracts<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.310> won't<00:02:24.549> actually<00:02:24.790> get

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
piston retracts so it won't actually get

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.660 
piston retracts so it won't actually get
powered<00:02:25.510> but<00:02:26.350> now<00:02:26.500> he<00:02:26.560> sees<00:02:26.799> no<00:02:26.920> items<00:02:27.400> left

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
powered but now he sees no items left

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.240 
powered but now he sees no items left
and<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.410> pretty<00:02:29.590> much<00:02:29.680> how<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.980> works

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
and this is pretty much how it works

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.069 
and this is pretty much how it works
there's<00:02:30.790> no<00:02:30.970> items<00:02:31.329> letting<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.660> dispenser

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
there's no items letting the dispenser

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.670 
there's no items letting the dispenser
so<00:02:32.200> when<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.440> item<00:02:32.620> D<00:02:32.950> spawns<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:35.290> piston

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
so when this item D spawns the piston

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.289 
so when this item D spawns the piston
doesn't<00:02:36.040> retract<00:02:36.280> therefore<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.000> gives<00:02:37.030> an

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
doesn't retract therefore it gives an

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.500 
doesn't retract therefore it gives an
output<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.829> is<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.940> know<00:02:39.970> pretty<00:02:40.390> much

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
output and that is you know pretty much

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.840 
output and that is you know pretty much
sums<00:02:40.900> up<00:02:41.019> how<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.350> works<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.579> did<00:02:42.730> have

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
sums up how this works and I did have

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.940 
sums up how this works and I did have
some<00:02:43.030> help<00:02:43.060> from<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.480> few<00:02:43.660> guys<00:02:43.840> trying<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.829> make

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
some help from a few guys trying to make

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.009 
some help from a few guys trying to make
one<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:46.180> seems<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> most

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
one but this seems like the most

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.120 
one but this seems like the most
reliable<00:02:47.470> version

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
reliable version

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.010 
reliable version
so<00:02:49.850> yeah<00:02:50.030> that's<00:02:50.240> pretty<00:02:50.360> much<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.690> let's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
so yeah that's pretty much it let's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.860 
so yeah that's pretty much it let's
learn<00:02:51.140> how<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.290> make<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:52.210> alright<00:02:53.210> so<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.570> start

put your pressure plate right here come

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.320 
put your pressure plate right here come
right<00:03:05.690> here<00:03:05.930> place<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.620> torch<00:03:06.950> with<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.580> block<00:03:08.120> on

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
right here place a torch with a block on

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.540 
right here place a torch with a block on
top<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:08.990> your<00:03:09.140> dispenser<00:03:09.770> facing<00:03:10.340> in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
top and then your dispenser facing in

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.750 
top and then your dispenser facing in
and<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:11.570> we<00:03:11.690> want<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.930> do<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.230> put<00:03:12.890> dust<00:03:13.310> here

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
and then we want to do is put dust here

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.540 
and then we want to do is put dust here
dust<00:03:14.540> repeater<00:03:15.500> there<00:03:15.740> sorry<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.220> repeater

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
dust repeater there sorry it repeater

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.030 
dust repeater there sorry it repeater
there<00:03:16.850> repeater<00:03:17.390> repeater<00:03:17.720> there<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.890> want

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
there repeater repeater there you want

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.700 
there repeater repeater there you want
to<00:03:19.100> replace<00:03:19.370> them<00:03:20.180> with<00:03:20.420> blocks<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.080> set<00:03:21.560> all

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
to replace them with blocks and set all

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.000 
to replace them with blocks and set all
of<00:03:21.740> these<00:03:22.010> repeaters<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.910> four<00:03:23.330> tix<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:24.740> can

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
of these repeaters to four tix you can

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.800 
of these repeaters to four tix you can
set<00:03:25.310> them<00:03:25.460> to<00:03:25.490> less<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.180> certain<00:03:26.690> occasions

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
set them to less on certain occasions

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.590 
set them to less on certain occasions
but<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:28.010> more<00:03:28.190> reliable<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.150> more

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
but it's more reliable to have more

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.900 
but it's more reliable to have more
delay<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.520> then<00:03:31.520> you<00:03:31.580> want<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.760> place<00:03:31.880> a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
delay and then you want to place a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.640 
delay and then you want to place a
sticky<00:03:32.180> piston<00:03:32.450> there<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.440> want<00:03:33.590> to

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
sticky piston there and you want to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.220 
sticky piston there and you want to
place<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:34.070> block<00:03:34.400> there<00:03:34.700> then<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.080> have

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
place a block there then you can have

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.660 
place a block there then you can have
your<00:03:36.290> output<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.400> here<00:03:37.940> here<00:03:38.570> or<00:03:38.690> here

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
your output to be here here here or here

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.480 
your output to be here here here or here
so<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:40.760> can<00:03:40.940> take<00:03:41.540> pretty<00:03:41.660> much<00:03:41.810> any<00:03:42.320> I'm<00:03:43.100> sure

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
so you can take pretty much any I'm sure

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.430 
so you can take pretty much any I'm sure
do<00:03:43.700> those<00:03:44.090> two<00:03:44.390> just<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.810> keep<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.050> in<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.230> same

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
do those two just to keep it in the same

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.590 
do those two just to keep it in the same
dimensions<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.370> then<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.180> can<00:03:47.330> use<00:03:47.450> any

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
dimensions and then you can use any

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.970 
dimensions and then you can use any
block<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.930> like<00:03:48.080> for<00:03:48.320> this<00:03:48.410> as<00:03:48.560> well<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:48.890> I

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
block you like for this as well but I

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.010 
block you like for this as well but I
don't<00:03:49.160> like<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.490> use<00:03:49.520> glass<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.780> cuz<00:03:50.930> it

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
don't like to use glass just cuz it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.960 
don't like to use glass just cuz it
looks<00:03:51.050> quite<00:03:51.440> nice<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.340> then<00:03:52.520> we<00:03:52.580> need<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> do

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
looks quite nice and then we need to do

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.570 
looks quite nice and then we need to do
is<00:03:53.150> chuck<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.600> your<00:03:53.960> blocks<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.190> ever

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
is chuck in your blocks so I ever

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.900 
is chuck in your blocks so I ever
actually<00:03:55.730> told<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.270> so<00:03:57.190> earlier<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.610> said

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
actually told you so earlier on I said

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.110 
actually told you so earlier on I said
it<00:03:59.180> takes<00:03:59.450> five<00:03:59.900> minutes<00:04:00.530> for<00:04:01.070> an<00:04:01.340> item<00:04:01.550> entity

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
it takes five minutes for an item entity

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.320 
it takes five minutes for an item entity
duty<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.720> despawn<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:04.010> if<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.400> wanted<00:04:04.820> this<00:04:05.030> to

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
duty to despawn so if you wanted this to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.890 
duty to despawn so if you wanted this to
go<00:04:05.360> for<00:04:06.430> let's<00:04:07.430> say<00:04:07.580> 50<00:04:08.210> minutes<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.810> would

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
go for let's say 50 minutes you would

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.120 
go for let's say 50 minutes you would
put<00:04:09.110> 10<00:04:09.470> items<00:04:10.010> into<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.520> dispenser<00:04:11.120> oops<00:04:12.130> so

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
put 10 items into the dispenser oops so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.980 
put 10 items into the dispenser oops so
yeah<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.280> wanted<00:04:13.730> it<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:13.940> go<00:04:14.060> 50<00:04:14.480> minutes<00:04:14.780> I

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
yeah I wanted it to go 50 minutes I

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.920 
yeah I wanted it to go 50 minutes I
would<00:04:15.290> put<00:04:15.670> 50<00:04:16.670> in<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:17.060> fountain<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.600> go<00:04:17.720> for

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
would put 50 in that fountain to go for

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.729 
would put 50 in that fountain to go for
10<00:04:18.140> and<00:04:18.410> put<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:19.030> 20<00:04:20.030> minutes<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.540> for<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.650> you

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
10 and put to 20 minutes is for so you

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.320 
10 and put to 20 minutes is for so you
basically<00:04:21.890> take<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.610> amount<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.030> time<00:04:23.300> you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
basically take the amount of time you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.410 
basically take the amount of time you
want<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.350> go<00:04:24.710> on<00:04:24.830> for<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.340> then<00:04:25.850> divide<00:04:26.210> the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
want it to go on for and then divide the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.860 
want it to go on for and then divide the
item<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.840> number<00:04:27.620> by<00:04:27.740> five<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:29.000> yeah<00:04:29.660> that's

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
item that number by five so yeah that's

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.350 
item that number by five so yeah that's
how<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.200> works<00:04:30.470> if<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.770> put<00:04:31.040> in<00:04:31.190> 9<00:04:31.610> stacks<00:04:32.060> of

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
how this works if you put in 9 stacks of
