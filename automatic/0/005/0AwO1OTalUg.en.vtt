well<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.879> think<00:00:03.149> it's<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.449> very<00:00:03.629> unique<00:00:03.990> program

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
well I think it's a very unique program

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.650 
well I think it's a very unique program
it's<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.490> program<00:00:05.520> for<00:00:06.089> international

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
it's a program for international

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.500 
it's a program for international
management<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.560> actually<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> best

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
management and actually one of the best

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.780 
management and actually one of the best
in<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.809> world

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.990 

maybe<00:00:15.270> I<00:00:15.420> could<00:00:15.660> sum<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.650> my<00:00:16.790> expectations<00:00:17.790> to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
maybe I could sum up my expectations to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.570 
maybe I could sum up my expectations to
three<00:00:18.300> points<00:00:18.780> that<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.140> worthless<00:00:19.800> teaching

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
three points that are worthless teaching

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.230 
three points that are worthless teaching
then<00:00:21.360> of<00:00:21.540> course<00:00:21.780> the<00:00:21.960> truly<00:00:22.290> global

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
experience and most importantly maybe

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.119

well<00:01:06.390> first<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.200> I've<00:01:07.440> never<00:01:07.620> been

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
well first of all I've never been

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
well first of all I've never been
tearing<00:01:08.190> up<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> Nordic<00:01:08.820> countries<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.690> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
tearing up the Nordic countries so I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
tearing up the Nordic countries so I
thought<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.440> be<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.799> good<00:01:11.010> way<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> start

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
thought would be a good way to start

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060 
thought would be a good way to start
from<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> capital<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> Finland<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.440> try

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
from the capital of Finland and then try

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640 
from the capital of Finland and then try
to<00:01:14.100> travel<00:01:14.670> around<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.690> experience<00:01:16.260> Russia

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to travel around and experience Russia

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.310 
to travel around and experience Russia
and<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> Scandinavian<00:01:18.000> countries<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> also

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and the Scandinavian countries but also

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.470 
and the Scandinavian countries but also
I<00:01:19.740> heard<00:01:20.010> them<00:01:20.160> Altos<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.210> renowned

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
I heard them Altos a really renowned

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.450 
I heard them Altos a really renowned
school<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> good<00:01:22.320> reputation<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:23.250> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
school has a good reputation which was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
school has a good reputation which was
also<00:01:23.760> very<00:01:24.150> important<00:01:24.660> for<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.200> basically
