alright and this is just gonna be a very
you<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.800> quick<00:02:38.160> overview<00:02:38.580> because<00:02:39.150> I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you know a quick overview because I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.390 
you know a quick overview because I
think<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.320> looks<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.800> knife<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
think the looks of the knife you know I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.610 
think the looks of the knife you know I
think<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.060> straightforward<00:02:42.570> design<00:02:43.380> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
think it's a straightforward design it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.410 
think it's a straightforward design it
speaks<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.010> itself<00:02:44.160> it's<00:02:44.640> about<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.210> right

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
speaks for itself it's about the right

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.590 
speaks for itself it's about the right
length<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.990> EDC<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.240> little

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
length for EDC it is a little a little

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.770 
length for EDC it is a little a little
wide<00:02:48.959> slightly<00:02:49.709> heavy<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.250> certainly

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
wide slightly heavy but certainly

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.930 
wide slightly heavy but certainly
something<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.930> lot<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.350> people<00:02:52.470> prefer<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.490> so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
something a lot of people prefer that so

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.730 
something a lot of people prefer that so
I<00:02:53.970> think<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.360> would<00:02:54.510> make<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.720> nice<00:02:54.990> EDC

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
I think this would make a nice EDC

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.220 
I think this would make a nice EDC
folder<00:02:56.220> everyday<00:02:56.640> carry<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.720> also<00:02:57.870> does

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
folder everyday carry and it also does

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.280 
folder everyday carry and it also does
come<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.920> drop-point<00:02:59.280> model<00:03:00.230> alright<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
come in a drop-point model alright I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.410 
come in a drop-point model alright I
think<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.459> know<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.940> tanto<00:03:03.390> is
