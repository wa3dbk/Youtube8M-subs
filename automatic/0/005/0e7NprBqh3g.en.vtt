00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 yes then I have the legs but 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.609
 it is the weather is a pity 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.820
 too close 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.620
 and I felt really good about that last one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.690
 make attacked done a lot of work 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 but then it does not only matter 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.570
 je de goed is also a tactical game 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 and so to make his choices and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 I finally entered the sprint 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.949
 normally pretty good but me 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.390
 had nothing left 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 one has the legs with the best roads 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.009
 not won today well i think 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.170
 that google was very good just that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.530
 has it 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.230
 yes tactical is being different works and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.239
 that worked out better for a final 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.690
 I thought this was very beautiful 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.920
 final it was actually from the bell 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.110
 fully open again 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.899
 if with each other and yes then you come with one 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.180
 button and must go with 2002 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.159
 Swedish and Swedish who queequeg 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.640
 whose cooking and then I had a very big one 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.250
 favorites is falling off 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.880
 yes two german that's the tricky 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.770
 check of course then 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.100
 and you can let that drive because then that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.689
 it falls silent if you yourself are not one 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.170
 attack was then a ride to the holes 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.189
 close 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.509
 how good were you today I have good 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.860
 therefore it also wants without it 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.960
 guessing it has not become cold 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.009
 clear erase I am disappointed 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.020
 bit of walking but that number so 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.049
 in ziggo 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.360
 choice that you make that you must 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.950
 Just at that moment standing behind you in 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.509
 don't doubt me so i don't have that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 done 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.130
 the plot is about the rainbow jersey 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.039
 how acidic is it if you are that good and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.340
 it just goes wrong 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.289
 yes that is very sour cent cent sin 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.509
 I got you a little less you and you and 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.610
 will help us then you can really be there 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.590
 very pleased we be sure if he 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.030
 so good one then 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.470
 then you really only want gold 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.390
 go we have to work we have to have more 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.159
 says that's also the game 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.810
 you fill in so many because you also do not 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.899
 but was comfortable at the final sprint point 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.899
 shall 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.940
 no attack because it is just whole 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.130
 tricky checking is so good on you that 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.470
 you ca n't you can't check that 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.290
 it turned out that it really was 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 inconvenient there was continuous attacking you 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 need to knit than we can do better 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.550
 before serving 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.430
 but 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.590
 yes that did not work and now for a moment 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.940
 vacation and then mud in it yes 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.380
 early December I go in December 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.720
 probably again 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.980
 field able to weather a lovely wk 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.360
 waiting for a new chance 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.570
 yes again new opportunities clock in own 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.570
 province 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.960
