like them the bearings I'm using or

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.789 
like them the bearings I'm using or
humanly<00:02:16.390> samples<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:16.959> all<00:02:17.049> just<00:02:17.230> dirty<00:02:17.500> but

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
humanly samples are all just dirty but

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
are the many logo bearings and they go

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.520 
are the many logo bearings and they go
pretty<00:02:21.939> fast<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:26.290> for

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
pretty fast as you can see but as for

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.149 
pretty fast as you can see but as for
everything<00:02:26.829> that<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.579> like<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:30.010> all

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
works together quite well to make a nice

works together quite well to make a nice
and<00:02:33.310> easy<00:02:35.220> board<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.700> cruise<00:02:37.510> around<00:02:37.659> on

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and easy board to just cruise around on

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.679 
and easy board to just cruise around on
okay<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.579> is<00:02:39.730> kind<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:40.000> how<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:40.120> feet<00:02:40.450> fit

okay so this is kind of how my feet fit

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.479 
okay so this is kind of how my feet fit
on<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.079> board<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.189> a<00:02:42.220> size

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
on the board just for like a size

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.149 
on the board just for like a size
reference<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:43.299> my<00:02:43.989> shoe<00:02:44.200> size<00:02:44.379> is<00:02:44.440> size<00:02:44.829> five

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159

and a half and I kind of you know I

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.720 
and a half and I kind of you know I
reach<00:02:50.739> over<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.129> board<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:51.579> it's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
reach over the board but it's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.789 
reach over the board but it's
comfortable<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.109> can<00:02:53.139> lead<00:02:53.440> back<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
comfortable and I can lead back and

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:05.039 
comfortable and I can lead back and
forth<00:02:54.010> pretty<00:02:54.280> well<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.900> my
