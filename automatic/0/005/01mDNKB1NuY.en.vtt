home<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.169> think<00:01:44.200> indeed<00:01:44.829> if<00:01:45.279> it<00:01:45.490> doesn't<00:01:45.700> have

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
home I think indeed if it doesn't have

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.359 
home I think indeed if it doesn't have
any<00:01:45.969> film<00:01:46.209> that<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.599> what<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.990> have<00:01:47.109> okay<00:01:47.380> up

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
any film that is what you have okay up

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.580 
any film that is what you have okay up
until<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.700> couple<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:49.029> years<00:01:49.090> ago<00:01:49.389> this<00:01:49.929> dark

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
until a couple of years ago this dark

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.800 
until a couple of years ago this dark
dark<00:01:50.919> window<00:01:51.369> tint<00:01:51.700> was<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.060> finest<00:01:52.509> window

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
dark window tint was the finest window

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.779 
dark window tint was the finest window
film<00:01:53.049> on<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.349> planet<00:01:53.740> up<00:01:54.369> until<00:01:54.669> a<00:01:54.700> couple

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
film on the planet up until a couple

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.999 
film on the planet up until a couple
years<00:01:55.060> ago<00:01:55.359> but<00:01:55.659> you'll<00:01:55.869> see<00:01:56.349> that<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.740> and

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
years ago but you'll see that it and

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.469 
years ago but you'll see that it and
feel<00:01:57.310> most<00:01:58.209> importantly<00:01:58.689> that<00:01:58.929> it<00:01:59.219> rejects

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
feel most importantly that it rejects

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.519 
feel most importantly that it rejects
visible<00:02:01.479> light<00:02:01.659> but<00:02:01.929> doesn't<00:02:02.169> do<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.259> whole<00:02:02.349> lot

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
visible light but doesn't do a whole lot

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:04.139 
visible light but doesn't do a whole lot
for<00:02:02.679> heat<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.099> still<00:02:03.399> feel<00:02:03.609> the<00:02:03.700> heat<00:02:03.819> coming

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
for heat I still feel the heat coming

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.139 
for heat I still feel the heat coming
through<00:02:04.389> okay<00:02:04.929> now<00:02:05.649> multi-layered<00:02:06.639> optical

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
through okay now multi-layered optical

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.699 
through okay now multi-layered optical
films<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.659> said<00:02:07.959> three<00:02:08.140> M's<00:02:08.319> newest

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
films like I said three M's newest

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.160 
films like I said three M's newest
innovation<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.850> coolest<00:02:10.270> thing<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.720> they<00:02:11.020> are

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
innovation the coolest thing is they are

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.200 
innovation the coolest thing is they are
virtually<00:02:11.800> invisible<00:02:13.170> but

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
virtually invisible but

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
virtually invisible but
that's<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.330> whole<00:02:16.480> idea<00:02:16.510> if<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.990> want<00:02:17.170> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
that's the whole idea if you want to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.110 
that's the whole idea if you want to
feel<00:02:17.350> there<00:02:18.780> my<00:02:19.780> gosh<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.200> don't<00:02:20.260> feel<00:02:20.470> anything

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
feel there my gosh I don't feel anything

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.340 
feel there my gosh I don't feel anything
that's<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.210> whole<00:02:22.330> lot<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.690> great<00:02:22.870> thing<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.200> if

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
that's a whole lot the great thing is if

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.020 
that's a whole lot the great thing is if
people<00:02:23.740> could<00:02:24.070> if<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.310> come<00:02:24.520> out<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> people's

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
people could if you come out to people's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
people could if you come out to people's
homes<00:02:25.270> they're<00:02:25.690> gonna<00:02:25.840> feel<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.170> exact<00:02:26.470> same

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
homes they're gonna feel the exact same

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.130 
homes they're gonna feel the exact same
thing<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.130> they'll<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.580> I'm<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:28.540> we

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
thing so they'll know that I'm not we

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.290 
thing so they'll know that I'm not we
always<00:02:29.590> win<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.250> always<00:02:30.400> bring<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.880> lamp<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
always win we always bring the lamp and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.780 
always win we always bring the lamp and
the<00:02:31.390> slides<00:02:31.660> with<00:02:31.990> us<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.010> how<00:02:33.220> does<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.580> do

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the slides with us but so how does it do

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.520 
the slides with us but so how does it do
it<00:02:33.820> when<00:02:34.210> it's<00:02:34.390> it's<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.380> there

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it when it's it's just in there

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.000 
it when it's it's just in there
somewhere

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
somewhere

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.150 
somewhere
it's<00:02:36.550> actually<00:02:37.120> over<00:02:37.270> 200<00:02:38.110> individual<00:02:38.860> layers

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
it's actually over 200 individual layers

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.460 
it's actually over 200 individual layers
of<00:02:39.490> optical<00:02:39.940> film<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.450> construction<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.170> this

of optical film the construction of this

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800 
of optical film the construction of this
window<00:02:41.860> film<00:02:42.160> more<00:02:42.520> closely<00:02:42.850> resembles<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
window film more closely resembles the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470 
window film more closely resembles the
construction<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.650> an<00:02:44.770> eyeglass<00:02:45.310> lens<00:02:45.670> than<00:02:46.330> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
construction of an eyeglass lens than it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.500 
construction of an eyeglass lens than it
does<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:47.140> dark<00:02:47.470> film<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> bottom<00:02:49.300> line

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
does this dark film but the bottom line

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.420 
does this dark film but the bottom line
is<00:02:49.720> when<00:02:49.960> applying<00:02:50.290> multi-layered<00:02:50.980> optical

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
good rule of thumb to keep in mind is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.930 
good rule of thumb to keep in mind is
for<00:03:01.180> every<00:03:01.510> 100<00:03:02.380> square<00:03:02.770> feet<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:03.310> multi-layer

for every 100 square feet of multi-layer
optical<00:03:04.420> film<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.720> apply<00:03:05.050> it's<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.830> adding

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
optical film you apply it's like adding

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.900 
optical film you apply it's like adding
one<00:03:06.580> ton<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.290> passive<00:03:08.290> air<00:03:08.440> conditioning<00:03:08.980> so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
one ton of passive air conditioning so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.300 
one ton of passive air conditioning so
the<00:03:10.360> average<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.900> 2,000<00:03:11.740> square<00:03:11.890> foot<00:03:12.160> house

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the average to 2,000 square foot house

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.280 
the average to 2,000 square foot house
carries<00:03:12.700> about<00:03:12.820> 300<00:03:13.600> square<00:03:13.720> feet<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.200> glass

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
carries about 300 square feet of glass

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.290 
carries about 300 square feet of glass
so<00:03:14.860> wrapping<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> entire<00:03:15.370> house<00:03:15.940> would<00:03:16.150> be

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
so wrapping the entire house would be

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.420 
so wrapping the entire house would be
like<00:03:16.450> adding<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.080> three<00:03:17.440> ton<00:03:17.680> air<00:03:17.920> conditioning

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
like adding a three ton air conditioning

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.010 
like adding a three ton air conditioning
unit<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.790> doesn't<00:03:18.970> use<00:03:19.180> any<00:03:19.330> power<00:03:19.570> can<00:03:19.930> we

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
unit that doesn't use any power can we

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.720 
unit that doesn't use any power can we
use<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.380> for<00:03:20.410> any<00:03:20.680> window<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.250> house<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.610> it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
use it for any window in the house is it

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.250 
use it for any window in the house is it
safe<00:03:21.910> for<00:03:21.940> all<00:03:22.180> kinds<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.540> wind<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:22.840> safe<00:03:23.080> for

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
safe for all kinds of wind it's safe for

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.840 
safe for all kinds of wind it's safe for
all<00:03:23.380> kinds<00:03:23.740> of<00:03:23.800> windows<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:24.310> do<00:03:24.580> make<00:03:24.790> sure

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
all kinds of windows but do make sure

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.690 
all kinds of windows but do make sure
that<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.270> use<00:03:25.600> 3m<00:03:26.020> because<00:03:26.770> cheaper

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that you use 3m because cheaper
