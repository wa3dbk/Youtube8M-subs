00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
this is definitely an eye-opener blaze
can't<00:01:22.619> weed<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.130> could<00:01:23.340> beat<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.580> phase

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
can't weed out I could beat up phase

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
can't weed out I could beat up phase
sensor<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:24.659> tried<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
sensor if I actually tried and then that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
sensor if I actually tried and then that
was<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> quote<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:26.610> faze<00:01:26.939> rug

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
was a quote from faze rug

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
was a quote from faze rug
I<00:01:27.659> replied<00:01:28.350> saying<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.950> sounds<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> call

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I replied saying that sounds like a call

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
I replied saying that sounds like a call
out<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.810> blaze<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.200> replied<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
out to me and then blaze can replied to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.170 
out to me and then blaze can replied to
me<00:01:31.710> saying<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.220> were<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> party<00:01:32.850> talking

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
me saying we were in a party talking

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
me saying we were in a party talking
about<00:01:33.360> who<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.960> could<00:01:34.140> beat<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> rug<00:01:35.340> said

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
about who we could beat up and rug said

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
about who we could beat up and rug said
he<00:01:35.759> could<00:01:35.939> take<00:01:36.060> sensor<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.689> need<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> make

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
he could take sensor we need to make

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890 
he could take sensor we need to make
this<00:01:37.320> happen<00:01:37.590> scarce<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.759> obviously<00:01:39.390> rugs

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this happen scarce so obviously rugs

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
this happen scarce so obviously rugs
probably<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> gonna<00:01:40.710> take<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.310> sensor<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
probably not gonna take on sensor I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
probably not gonna take on sensor I
think<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> sensor<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.290> pretty<00:01:43.500> buff<00:01:43.710> guy

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think you know sensor is pretty buff guy

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
think you know sensor is pretty buff guy
I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.189> sensor<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:44.790> beat<00:01:44.970> him<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I think sensor could beat him up but I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
I think sensor could beat him up but I
personally<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.740> rug<00:01:47.220> could<00:01:47.460> rise

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
personally think rug could rise

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730 
personally think rug could rise
victorious<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> try<00:01:48.720> hard<00:01:48.750> enough<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
victorious if you try hard enough but I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
victorious if you try hard enough but I
definitely<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.640> poll<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> guys<00:01:51.420> I
