the measure in libraries you begin to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.589

future be reading out of these little

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
future be reading out of these little
readers<00:04:07.199> will<00:04:07.799> they<00:04:07.919> continue<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.579> go<00:04:08.729> back<00:04:08.909> to

readers will they continue to go back to

out like they have for generations it's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.599 
out like they have for generations it's
my<00:04:15.329> belief<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.380> times<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.829> changed<00:04:17.250> or

my belief that the times have changed or

my belief that the times have changed or
times<00:04:17.940> are<00:04:18.180> changing<00:04:18.659> at<00:04:18.780> least<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.260> that

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
times are changing at least and that

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.319 
times are changing at least and that
people<00:04:20.010> should<00:04:20.190> be<00:04:20.340> considering<00:04:20.909> what<00:04:21.299> a

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
people should be considering what a
