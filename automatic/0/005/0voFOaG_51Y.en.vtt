this on a mobile lunch like for work or
picnic<00:02:33.190> or<00:02:33.370> something<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.850> probably<00:02:34.060> cut

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
picnic or something I probably cut

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.900

everything<00:02:35.260> up<00:02:35.560> assemble<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.550> take<00:02:36.880> it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910

separately and arrange it together on

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.290 
separately and arrange it together on
the<00:02:40.360> spot<00:02:41.260> because<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.670> lettuce<00:02:43.030> will

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the spot because the lettuce will

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.410 
the spot because the lettuce will
probably<00:02:43.690> wilt<00:02:43.930> once<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.620> lemon<00:02:45.220> juice<00:02:45.430> hits

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.539 
longer and then when you go to eat it
that's<00:04:16.199> when<00:04:16.530> things<00:04:16.709> get<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.039> little<00:04:17.310> bit<00:04:17.400> more

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.150 
that's when things get a little bit more
challenging<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:19.049> that's<00:04:19.500> when<00:04:19.709> your<00:04:19.859> choice

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
challenging and that's when your choice

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.560 
challenging and that's when your choice
of<00:04:20.600> leaf<00:04:21.600> comes<00:04:22.049> into<00:04:22.590> play<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.639> we<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.060> roll

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
of leaf comes into play so we just roll

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.750 
of leaf comes into play so we just roll
