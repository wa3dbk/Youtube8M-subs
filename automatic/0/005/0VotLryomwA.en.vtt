you<00:02:00.520> know<00:02:00.640> despite<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.119> fact<00:02:01.270> i'm<00:02:01.509> playing<00:02:01.750> in

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
you know despite the fact i'm playing in

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.929 
you know despite the fact i'm playing in
sectors<00:02:02.320> right<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.770> minute<00:02:03.040> they<00:02:03.610> don't<00:02:03.790> fit

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
sectors right this minute they don't fit

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.340 
sectors right this minute they don't fit
my<00:02:04.060> place<00:02:04.299> down<00:02:04.329> at<00:02:04.630> all<00:02:04.750> i<00:02:04.930> mean<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.200> main

reason i'm playing in sectors right now

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.910 
reason i'm playing in sectors right now
is<00:02:06.850> because<00:02:06.969> n<00:02:07.299> sector<00:02:07.990> Hornet<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.500> probably

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
is because n sector Hornet is probably

you<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.030> do<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.569> construct<00:04:07.989> your<00:04:08.290> deck<00:04:08.470> to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
you have to do is construct your deck to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.110 
you have to do is construct your deck to
where<00:04:08.829> your<00:04:09.340> monsters<00:04:09.700> don't<00:04:09.819> care<00:04:10.030> about

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
where your monsters don't care about

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.819 
where your monsters don't care about
those<00:04:10.359> two<00:04:10.569> cards<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.139> if<00:04:11.440> your<00:04:11.620> opponent

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
those two cards and if your opponent

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.740 
those two cards and if your opponent
can't<00:04:12.220> play<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.579> do<00:04:12.760> they<00:04:13.329> just<00:04:13.569> get

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
can't play you do they just get

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.900 
can't play you do they just get
absolutely<00:04:14.290> destroyed<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:15.100> also<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:15.790> that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
absolutely destroyed I also think that

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.940 
absolutely destroyed I also think that
the<00:04:16.060> Mac<00:04:16.389> engine<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.870> fairly<00:04:17.109> future<00:04:17.560> proof<00:04:17.799> I

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
the Mac engine is fairly future proof I

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.129 
the Mac engine is fairly future proof I
mean<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.700> know<00:04:18.820> macrocosmos<00:04:19.570> can<00:04:19.840> disrupt

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
mean you know macrocosmos can disrupt

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.260 
mean you know macrocosmos can disrupt
