can<00:01:16.189> see<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.399> didn't<00:01:16.820> spend<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.210> whole<00:01:17.329> lot<00:01:17.570> of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
can see I didn't spend a whole lot of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600 
can see I didn't spend a whole lot of
time<00:01:17.930> on<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.560> wanted<00:01:18.829> to<00:01:18.979> make<00:01:19.399> sure

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
time on it I just wanted to make sure

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.880

all<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.880> dirt<00:01:20.090> was<00:01:20.329> off<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.539> it<00:01:20.930> probably

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
all the dirt was off of it probably

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.289 
all the dirt was off of it probably
could<00:01:22.009> use<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.189> little<00:01:22.369> more<00:01:22.549> sanding<00:01:22.970> up<00:01:23.090> in

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
could use a little more sanding up in

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.580 
could use a little more sanding up in
here<00:01:23.600> because<00:01:23.780> that's<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:24.049> little<00:01:24.229> bit<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.439> rust

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
here because that's a little bit of rust
