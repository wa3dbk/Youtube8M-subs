00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:20.320
 and we find pamela gonzÃ¡lez 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.090
 designer how are you pamela very well 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.100
 thank you I have seen that you have done many 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.440
 changes in the store that you have a 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.180
 new collection tell us a little about 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.830
 if the truth was before oriented 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.110
 towards a youth market I think one goes 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.280
 growing with its collections and good 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.019
 now I am focused on what is 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.690
 really haute couture and I'm doing 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.519
 a this not only long dress but 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.230
 cocktail dresses and also some 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.039
 also sets that are for events 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.039
 more elegant 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 what kind of colors and textures what kind 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.049
 of fabrics you have used for this new 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.460
 good collection is actually this 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.589
 collection has been geared for a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 niger market then there are many more 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.890
 social events so to speak there are 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.000
 Many more uses of dresses cut the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.799
 etc 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.899
 is separated from the collection this first 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.240
 collection between three groups that are the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.210
 group of blacks with pink and beige 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.280
 the group of reds and colors more 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.440
 strong and good the golden group 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 and beautiful clear 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.159
 everyone obviously has good all 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 has the same concept that is to mix 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.119
 the textures and create something good 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.459
 definitely new but each group 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.280
 has its touch for example the group of 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:32.399
 the blacks is a more classic style is 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.929
 a style more or less and good origin 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.880
 the group of the reds is a group a lot 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.080
 more aggressive much more youthful and a lot 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.179
 more textures angles without 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.799
 transfers and the group of the dorados 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.920
 includes more what are textures and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.920
 tissues 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060
 and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.280
 I see that in several of your designs you have 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.900
 used a combination of houses and fabrics 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.580
 what happens we're going to work with 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.760
 textures that are the most natural 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.380
 possible that is silks cottons in that 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.140
 group I'm even saying in silk and 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 at home and I think of transparencies using 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.310
 transparent fabrics and textures 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.290
 different everything is crochet 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.240
 there's even part of the sets that 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.670
 if you want, you put it with lines, sacks and 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 it becomes casual then it's like a 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 intermediate between the elegant and relaxed 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:33.850
 not good now how do you see the weather that does not 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.730
 there is a lot of change in terms of the season 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.580
 if he still continues to heat do you think 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.170
 you or what should I continue to use 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.820
 I think that really for example cotton 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.410
 can be used in winter and in summer it 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.150
 what's happening is that I'm pretty much in a 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.459
 wave that is ok you are a dress 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.780
 bandages and how it's cold you use is a sack 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.250
 over then the idea is to look for a 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.240
 alternative of a kind of chongo 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.640
 something that is followed 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.170
 smart the same time so go in 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.940
 it's a closed place obviously inside 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.360
 you can take out and you can continue as a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.360
 summer 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.650
 they have also invited you to a 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.260
 very important event if neither wii version 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.820

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.210

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.450
