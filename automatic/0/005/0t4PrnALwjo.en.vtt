00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.460
 so I was able to stay here on the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 mobile world congress in barcelona and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.970
 that's it's beautiful new wave y 300 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.279
 which come in the near future on the market 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.670
 I will now time May to June it will 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.410
 his 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.060
 I would say we go in one time 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.940
 get around and I divorce shows you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 that's a little closer to the front we have 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.500
 a 4 inch display and a resolution 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.480
 of 800 x 480 pixels pretty much the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 standard resolution it is psg es display 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 that means and can read very nicely 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.290
 it's the vehicle and you can do it like that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.410
 said from all sides very nice 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 readable beautiful bright colors man 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.719
 sees that reacts very fast 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.110
 finger inputs and of course, too 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.520
 multitouch 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.360
 otherwise here a front camera discounts 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.460
 in the back we have a camera with 5 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.960
 megapixel and probably 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.930
 autofocus and of course led-flash one 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.600
 will be able to record 720p videos 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.920
 I also think full HD videos 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.780
 otherwise the usual connections I 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.830
 I do not have to show that anymore 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.200
 we have a total of eight here 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.360
 Gigabyte memory is not installed here 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.410
 closer specified one can the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.180
 expand memory 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.940
 and here is a really big one too 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.979
 Batteries are with 1130 milliamp hours 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.800
 The device should be loose one day 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.630
 So hold out about four to five 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.960
 hours display should indicate that 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.030
 because even the built-in processor 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.030
 third basket users are with the title 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.890
 heart is very fast but also energy 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.130
 save we go briefly in the browser 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.860
 we have no wifi right 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 ok so we go again briefly the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 attitudes because that is the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.039
 latest version of android us 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.110
 have here is not android 4.1 and 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.710
 quite the latest but one of the current 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.689
 rally bean and a very nice 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 surface of the I have here before 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.649
 was installed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.319
 you can turn on music here via his 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.090
 back it seems no music is allowed 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.720
 could in the photos go directly to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.790
 were made here and the 5 megapixel 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.920
 camera shows quite well here 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.920
 be at least in good light 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.280
 otherwise it would have to be synonymous with dream 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.000
 team we have series equipment here 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.970
 so it's not now 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 not quite final here have the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.980
 possibility of different teams 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.200
 to set that is the surface 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.220
 varies depending on how you use them 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.440
 otherwise would like to have normal 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.810
 android apps are possible have 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 here the browser chrome gmail we know 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.950
 also use other e mail client like 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.989
 amex that means you can do that too 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.319
 You can also navigate maps 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.250
 Download offline and as well 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.590
 Use navi 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.600
 of course the place to go where you can get apps 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.090
 like facebook or whats app 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.170
 can download 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.299
 Overall, this is a very nice 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.420
 fast device with a good one 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.329
 Unfortunately no equipment but 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.220
 for the price of about 200 euro 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.140
 It will soon be on the market 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.500
 a very nice device 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.819
 that was 100 if you liked the video 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 has then definitely one 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.840
 Thumb up and subscribe to the channel

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.660
