scratches<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.270> since<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.930> patina<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.619> them

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
scratches and since I'm patina in them

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
scratches and since I'm patina in them
that's<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> pretty<00:01:28.619> much<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.950> expected<00:01:29.579> for

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that's to pretty much be expected for

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
that's to pretty much be expected for
original<00:01:30.210> bumpers<00:01:30.630> though<00:01:30.869> unless<00:01:31.409> they've

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
original bumpers though unless they've

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.280 
original bumpers though unless they've
been<00:01:32.009> show<00:01:32.820> quality<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.900> I'd<00:01:33.960> say<00:01:34.140> they're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
been show quality so I'd say they're

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.340 
been show quality so I'd say they're
good<00:01:34.470> driver<00:01:34.829> quality
