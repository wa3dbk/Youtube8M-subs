00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.740
 Talk about the proclamations or patrick 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.630
 Blanc if today I'm going to teach music 3 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.250
 for the 4 2 hawaii engineers 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.539
 I'm going to adapt the music so we can play 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.430
 with only one guitar 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.989
 so I'll start playing the whole song 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 and then I'll explain the rhythm of the 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.230
 chords 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.350
 Truly true once in a lifetime 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.289
 you fall in love 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.589
 my son's mistakes for the truth go 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.000
 in front of my friend showed the action 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.000
 in this dead end 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 Indeed, with the invention in the wound 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.520
 you fall in love 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.280
 my centers 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.340
 I lost my keys but my head. 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 now it will have to be 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.659
 for everything in life 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170
 i 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.640
 we are the best 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.990
 sounds you can make 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.729
 The shot can not believe it. 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.729
 and you can not choose 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.240
 if I had the strength you think 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.240
 that I have I would engrave on metal 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.280
 made eight of the world made fractured 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.799
 sound 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.440
 the best sonso of art 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.660
 We can do it. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.379
 and where you can not help it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.379
 what you can not hide 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.760
 an introduction in the first part we 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.760
 Let's have these bigger man chords. 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.590
 the cycle 5th and 9th 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.799
 I liked the smaller one 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.800
 the bones greatest period 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.730
 what inner inside 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.830
 ours is afraid of a minute 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.630
 look that 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.290
 dk true or less once in a lifetime you 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.959
 fell in love 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.870
 some good and do not stand in half 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:13.510
 It was opposite my friend from the star 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:16.479
 reason for this dead end of kahn 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.060
 Truth puts your finger on the wound 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.270
 you fall in love 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.710
 the calves and I asked to find more 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.699
 Rich, my time will tell. 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.699
 for everything 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.170
 well in this part we have two rhythms 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.010
 in the introduction we will start with 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.010
 this rhythm here 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.650
 He is very quiet, we play once. 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.030
 Down, we'll play six later. 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.030
 months alternating looks only 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.750
 I'll do it as a chord change. 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.090
 the second rhythm will be the one that there is 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:23.440
 We swapped two of them down to 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:26.370
 up and down up 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.370
 look that 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.610
 so in the introduction we use the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.380
 first rhythm in the first part of the 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.510
 music we use the second rhythm only 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.900
 that we can mix both rhythms 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.900
 look that 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:02.410
 this may happen during the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:07.319
 music in the chorus we have only one 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.319
 new accord that the minor janitor 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.639
 the rhythm is the same only that we have a 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.970
 variation that I'll explain later 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.970
 look that 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.640
 we are the best 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.990
 dreams of giving to make 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:43.660
 I say can not really avoid 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.660
 and you can not choose 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.780
 looks just entering the chorus we will 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.780
 have what 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.760
 we have a normal rhythm here in the 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.760
 destination of the minor 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.990
 We'll play three times in the 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.990
 down to the top 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.660
 It's going to stay here. 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:25.020
 then we play once with the star of the 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:27.539
 smaller once on the side and on the ninth and we 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.559
 with the normal rhythm in cycle 5 and 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.699
 9th 

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:31.699
 so this part is going to stay this way 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.950
 then just go on with that one 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.600
 first rate good people for today is 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.580
 I hope you have learned the 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.190
 like any doubt or suggestion of 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.110

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.070
 other plush club classes 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.070
 hug and see you around
