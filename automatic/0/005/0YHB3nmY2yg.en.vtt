00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.220
 The red kite is best recognized 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.470
 his characteristic flight he moves 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.130
 he seldom sails the wings instead 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.130
 on the upswing 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 are particularly striking are fork 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:54.239
 tail and the white spots on the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:57.180
 underside of the wing small wood pieces 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.129
 alternate with wide hilly agrar 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.440
 and meadow areas from this landscape 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.770
 is a perfect breeding ground for the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.770
 red kite 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.840
 the two red kites in the nabu 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.570
 Griffon bird catching up have started 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.900
 hurt the wings they are there to 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.900
 recover 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.659
 So a red kite was the one with us 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.420
 and we have then populated briefly 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.890
 and sent out and then had him two 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.810
 weeks later again 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 he was found and a windmill so 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.549
 we suspect that he is probably in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.620
 the windmill leaves came in 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.840
 had been injured there and the other 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.760
 were accidental car accident what that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.819
 The most common is why we hurt here 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.319
 animals caught 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.120
 We had lead poisoning just when 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.790
 you could tell the animal had 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.519
 already by one so by X-ray 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.690
 or just in the stomach forces were 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.519
 otherwise you can not poison so 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.019
 Often sometimes they die 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.180
 animals and we now know why then 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.890
 it could be a compaction but so 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.400
 difficult auditors because not everyone 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.329
 unclear case a blood test entry 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.790
 because it just too 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:52.200
 cost factor is just in the breeding season 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.060
 the red kites need a lot of rest 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.660
 because too many problems will the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.400
 abandoned 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.040
 who's looking at forest walks? 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.630
 can be kept open by litter marks on the ground 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.730
 often hest and nests find the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.620
 Horst finds should be in the breeding season 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.620
 make a big bow around her 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.180
 and also no forest work nearby 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.180
 To run 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.000
 held another danger in finally 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.950
 Power plants which the animals with their 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.510
 M rotor blades fit in and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.180
 worst case can kill 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.940
 through various actions and projects 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.780
 the red kite will be in front of these and others 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.780
 protected 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.879
 The red kite is a big flight and big birds 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.599
 have the property respectively 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.319
 Risk to you 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.700
 technical facilities like 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.510
 medium voltage power lines 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.640
 accident and for this defuse 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.310
 There is one of power lines 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.620
 Paragraphs in the nature conservation law of 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.859
 is to implement and over the data the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.410
 we collect in the state office identify 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.900
 we region where red kites piled 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.130
 occurrence 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.110
 a measure that we have this year 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.960
 have done with the foundation 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.690
 environment and nature Rhineland Palatinate is the 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880
 action where is milan 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.010
 Here we have a broad campaign 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.300
 started public involvement 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.419
 that the public that I quasi 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.750
 anyone's lady redmilan directions 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.190
 which are made to the environmental foundation 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.979
 can register 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.280
 this was an internet portal 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.990
 furnished with a very special 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.820
 Entering software so that each one 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.000
 red milan sightings that one made 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.940
 could also accurately report so we 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.860
 get better information overall 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.330
 about the spread and occurrence of 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.330
 Red Kite in Rhineland Palatinate 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.780
 Everyone can help protect this species 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.430
 contribute 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.470
 the abandonment of the use of 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.110
 Pesticides and toxins to mice 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.580
 Fighting helps the red kite before 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.460
 protect against poisoning 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.350
 a multi-faceted landscape with 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.590
 different usage time points 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.840
 guaranteed meadows and fields 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.000
 such a rich food offer and 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.710
 thus the necessary offspring rate 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.560
 by understanding for the particular 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.190
 situation of the red kite for example 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.600
 the planning of wind turbines and 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.430
 Power lines can be locations 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.820
 preferred are the less 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:58.040
 are problematic if everyone participate 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.290
 have the red kite and thus the 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.290
 natural diversity good cards
