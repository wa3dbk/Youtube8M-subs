work the exact same way because the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.050 
work the exact same way because the
light<00:02:12.020> is<00:02:12.050> reflected<00:02:12.860> out<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.550> tap<00:02:13.790> them

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
light is reflected out of the tap them

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.570 
light is reflected out of the tap them
back<00:02:15.020> through<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.590> retina<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.160> exact

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
same location that it entered so there's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.730
