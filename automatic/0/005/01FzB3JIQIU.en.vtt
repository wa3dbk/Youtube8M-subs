difficult<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.409> did

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
difficult because I think that did

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.870 
difficult because I think that did

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
carving new artistic ground I think that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.180 
carving new artistic ground I think that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
relevant question 20 years ago we were

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.850 
relevant question 20 years ago we were
like<00:02:47.000> okay<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:49.050> there's<00:02:49.230> still<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> lot<00:02:49.739> of

that<00:02:56.160> are<00:02:56.220> still<00:02:56.519> being<00:02:56.700> figured<00:02:56.879> out<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:58.430> think

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that are still being figured out I think

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.259 
that are still being figured out I think
if<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.760> look<00:03:00.030> at<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.920> pioneering<00:03:01.920> acts<00:03:02.819> of
