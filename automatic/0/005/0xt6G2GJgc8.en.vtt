difference between a pillow ball and the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
difference between a pillow ball and the

normal bushing pillow ball is going to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
normal bushing pillow ball is going to
be<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> full<00:01:03.480> metal<00:01:03.719> bearing<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.589> bushing<00:01:04.920> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
be a full metal bearing where bushing is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.140 
be a full metal bearing where bushing is
either<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> rubber<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.850> polyurethane

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
either gonna be a rubber or polyurethane

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
either gonna be a rubber or polyurethane
of<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.750> sort<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.080> gonna<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.470> softer

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of some sort it's gonna be much softer

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
of some sort it's gonna be much softer
this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.000> harder<00:01:09.330> than<00:01:09.360> any<00:01:09.689> type

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
this is going to be harder than any type

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
this is going to be harder than any type
of<00:01:09.930> bushing<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.130> give<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
of bushing but it's going to give you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880 
of bushing but it's going to give you
direct<00:01:11.729> feedback<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.110> sway<00:01:13.320> bar<00:01:13.530> so
