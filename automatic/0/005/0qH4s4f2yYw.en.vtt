stage<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.330> generating<00:04:36.990> brake<00:04:37.740> torque<00:04:38.330> with

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
stage of generating brake torque with

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.969 
stage of generating brake torque with
the<00:04:39.449> caliper<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.139> then<00:04:40.440> with<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> brake

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
the caliper and then with the brake

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.999 
the caliper and then with the brake
discs<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:42.630> is<00:04:42.840> our<00:04:43.110> brake<00:04:43.680> disc<00:04:46.009> through

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
discs and this is our brake disc through

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.659 
discs and this is our brake disc through
the<00:04:47.130> brake<00:04:47.280> head<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:48.810> are<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.770> have<00:04:49.919> the

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
the brake head you are you have the

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.080 
the brake head you are you have the
Destiny<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.150> attached<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.660> other<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:53.090> so

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
Destiny is attached to the other and so

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.520 
Destiny is attached to the other and so
the<00:04:54.240> disc<00:04:54.389> is<00:04:54.570> rotating<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:55.259> have<00:04:55.380> the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
the disc is rotating you have the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.490 
the disc is rotating you have the
caliper<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:56.669> clump<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.599> pet<00:04:57.840> against<00:04:58.349> that

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
caliper that clump the pet against that

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.550 
caliper that clump the pet against that
is<00:04:58.620> generating<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.580> friction<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.990> cooling

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
is generating the friction this cooling

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.159 
is generating the friction this cooling
design<00:05:01.919> is<00:05:02.280> done<00:05:02.849> in<00:05:03.030> order<00:05:03.240> to<00:05:03.360> maximum<00:05:03.960> the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.520 

the<00:05:09.670> the<00:05:10.300> material<00:05:10.750> as<00:05:10.840> we<00:05:10.990> discussed<00:05:11.350> is<00:05:11.500> the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
the the material as we discussed is the

the the material as we discussed is the
same<00:05:11.830> we<00:05:12.010> used<00:05:12.220> on<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.370> 24<00:05:12.850> hour<00:05:12.940> of<00:05:13.150> Lamar's
