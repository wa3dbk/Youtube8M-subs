00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.570
 day of the league bbva match 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 played in the power eight stadium and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.130
 with a very intense Spanish that had 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.860
 many chances of goal and that at 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.810
 final did not get the win on 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.890
 sporty therefore satisfied after 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.480
 the 90 minutes the initiative the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.439
 occasions and even 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.300
 the stick were for the Spanish this is 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.059
 the occasion of lucas vázquez sending the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.100
 ball to the crossbar in the 11th minute already 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.510
 of the first period the best of the game 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.699
 probably for the Spanish while 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.449
 that in the second the goalkeeper Fabricio 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.430
 he avoided the victory of the men of 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.650
 sergio gonzález colotto was incorporated 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.350
 to attack also in this action to 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.150
 to top off spectacular Chilean 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.809
 the ex precisely from the sports of the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.780
 Coruña a Spanish without Sergio Garcia but 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.030
 with much much above especially in 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.729
 second line with names like paco 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.520
 mountaineer who also put to the test 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.550
 goalkeeper Fabricio that already in the first 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.560
 period 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.540
 he starred in many interventions 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.940
 level like this ball that ends 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.550
 removing the ex from zaragoza 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.710
 the intense Spanish in the domain skimming 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.050
 often 65 percent 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.630
 possession hanging balloons and having 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.740
 second opportunities like this in the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.369
 that the ball 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.369
 with too much thread engaged with the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.370
 empeine by lucas vázquez ends 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.140
 rejected again by fabricio 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.570
 little arrivals by the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.280
 Deportivo de la Coruña and in fact there are 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.640
 to go to the second period to find 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.790
 this fault executed by medunjanin 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.190
 11 by the way the one of the dépor exactly 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.500
 traced to the last victory of the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.680

 fits with more zeal here claimed stuani 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.010
 a possible penalty the transfer of insua 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.720
 terribly bad and there it takes advantage 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.500
 to hit him with the instep stuani that 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.660
 He was claimed by the Fabricio penalty 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.820
 pushing from the bands in Spanish 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.190
 hanging balls and finishing off the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.790
 Uruguayan to try to surprise the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.860
 first measures of the second period of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.100
 caicedo with more artillery up the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.990
 Spanish also searched for the goal another 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.430
 shot away this time from lucas 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.700
 vázquez minute 15 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.909

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.490
 that has lucas vázquez the third great 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.820
 opportunity 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.740

 let vote and you will end up going very 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.660
 up the ball 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.720
 the Spanishista siege was a constant 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.550
 in the second half here the one who finishes 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.660
 is felipe caicedo and then the second 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.990
 option is for paco montañés opportunity 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.420
 very clear goal also minute 25 the 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.420

 and the audience of the power &amp; this although not 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.060
 you could believe that his team did not 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.609
 I managed to score the goal that I would give 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.049
 the victory at the end golden point for 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.250
