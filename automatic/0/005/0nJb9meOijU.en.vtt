00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Good day today , we will see how to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.060
 makes a flat friendship ribbon 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.960
 For this we need to find in three 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.849
 different colours 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.290
 here we have a blue red and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 a yellow flags 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 they must be quite long by 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 double and knot in the middle 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.260
 along with this movie will be the whole 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.260
 then fixed in the tabletop 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
 Now we separate the threads as we do 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.460
 For example, the two yellow ones want the two 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.760
 red and the two blue ones respectively 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.760
 together 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.330
 then we do the first yellow 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.330
 thread a knot around the second yellow 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.580
 thread and finally the two 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.650
 red and around the two blue threads 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.220
 where we always knot the knots 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.220
 tighten 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.530
 Now we are doing exactly the same with the 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.530
 other yellow thread 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.750
 and then with the blue that too 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.460
 the whole technique 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.439
 But let's have a look at the knot 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.810
 more specifically my four out of the two 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.190
 to knot in velen feel for one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.119
 through the other and pull 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.119
 him firmly up 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.869
 finished now have a nice flat 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.869
 friendship b√§ndchen
