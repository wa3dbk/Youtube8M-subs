00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
but actually he is a specially based one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
but actually he is a specially based one
and<00:01:38.310> he<00:01:38.520> acts<00:01:38.670> he<00:01:38.790> sets<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> nastyplot

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and he acts he sets up the nastyplot

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.120 
and he acts he sets up the nastyplot
which<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.409> weird<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.009> know

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
which is kind of weird don't really know

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.880 
which is kind of weird don't really know
why<00:01:41.280> he<00:01:41.400> didn't<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> vacuum<00:01:42.420> wave

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
why he didn't go for the vacuum wave

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.490 
why he didn't go for the vacuum wave
that<00:01:43.890> turned<00:01:44.159> before<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.909> yeah<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.380> I'm

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that turned before but yeah now I'm

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.830 
that turned before but yeah now I'm
predicting<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> racking<00:01:47.369> wave<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.750> he

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
predicting the racking wave here but he

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
predicting the racking wave here but he
ends<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> Focus<00:01:49.860> Blast<00:01:49.890> which

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
ends up going for the Focus Blast which

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
ends up going for the Focus Blast which
kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> questions<00:01:51.030> me<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.899> he's<00:01:52.079> kind<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
kind of questions me what he's kind of

does he have priority or not I'll never

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.580 
does he have priority or not I'll never
know<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.180> I'll<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.930> him<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> bug

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
know but I'll take him out with a bug

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
know but I'll take him out with a bug
buzz<00:01:58.829> or<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.579> yanmega<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
buzz or with a yanmega so that that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.090 
buzz or with a yanmega so that that
works<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.320> perfectly<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.860> well

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
works out perfectly as well

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.609 
works out perfectly as well
yanmega<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.270> beast<00:02:03.600> mode<00:02:04.140> took<00:02:04.469> down

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
yanmega is going beast mode took down

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.609 
yanmega is going beast mode took down
two<00:02:05.070> Pokemon<00:02:05.520> we're<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.270> nice<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.530> he

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
two Pokemon we're really nice so now he

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
two Pokemon we're really nice so now he
goes<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:07.890> into<00:02:08.340> his<00:02:08.729> Outland<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.360> still

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
goes back into his Outland I'm still

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
goes back into his Outland I'm still
thinking<00:02:10.140> he's<00:02:10.379> scarfed

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
thinking he's scarfed

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.970 
thinking he's scarfed
so<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> am<00:02:12.750> gonna<00:02:12.900> switch<00:02:13.260> out<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.620> gonna<00:02:13.830> go

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so I am gonna switch out I'm gonna go

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.710 
so I am gonna switch out I'm gonna go
into<00:02:14.250> my<00:02:14.280> heat<00:02:14.700> trend<00:02:15.060> because<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
into my heat trend because I know I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.930 
into my heat trend because I know I
resist<00:02:16.380> pretty<00:02:16.920> much<00:02:17.130> every<00:02:17.460> move<00:02:17.700> from

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
resist pretty much every move from

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
resist pretty much every move from
Scotland<00:02:18.420> since<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.230> one's<00:02:19.470> move<00:02:19.740> pool

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
Scotland since that one's move pool

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.770 
Scotland since that one's move pool
isn't<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.640> great<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.630> gets

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
isn't really that great and it gets

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.540 
isn't really that great and it gets
walled<00:02:22.050> by<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> lot<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.650> Pokemon<00:02:23.040> especially

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
walled by a lot of Pokemon especially

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.840 
walled by a lot of Pokemon especially
Steel's<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.380> set<00:02:25.560> up<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.740> sub<00:02:25.920> freely<00:02:26.460> on

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
Steel's so I can set up a sub freely on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.650 
Steel's so I can set up a sub freely on
the<00:02:27.270> switch<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.770> am<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.520> sub<00:02:29.910> torment<00:02:30.390> trend

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the switch and I am a sub torment trend

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.840 
the switch and I am a sub torment trend
and<00:02:30.870> what<00:02:31.410> tournament<00:02:31.800> does<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.580> use<00:02:32.610> it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and what tournament does is if I use it

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.820 
and what tournament does is if I use it
the<00:02:33.330> opponent<00:02:33.750> can't<00:02:33.960> use<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.380> same<00:02:34.620> move

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the opponent can't use the same move

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.610 
the opponent can't use the same move
twice<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.270> work<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.660> really

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
twice so that would work out really

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.380 
twice so that would work out really
nicely<00:02:37.860> especially<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.790> case<00:02:39.030> because

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
nicely especially in this case because

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.680 
nicely especially in this case because
loking<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.560> torment<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.640> action<00:02:42.270> he<00:02:42.480> won't

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
loking with torment in action he won't

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.260 
loking with torment in action he won't
be<00:02:42.780> able<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.020> go<00:02:43.710> for<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.040> called<00:02:44.310> two<00:02:44.940> times

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
be able to go for this called two times

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.920 
be able to go for this called two times
in<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> row

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
in a row

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.350 
in a row
so<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.860> set<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.220> sub<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:47.640> he<00:02:47.910> doesn't<00:02:48.300> go

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
so I can set up a sub as he doesn't go

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.690 
so I can set up a sub as he doesn't go
for<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.570> scald<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.190> that's<00:02:50.190> gonna<00:02:50.310> work<00:02:50.490> out

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
for the scald and that's gonna work out

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.430 
for the scald and that's gonna work out
nicely<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.660> protect<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
nicely and then I can protect on the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.470 
nicely and then I can protect on the
turn<00:02:52.620> he<00:02:52.740> does<00:02:52.920> go<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> scald<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.270> can

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
turn he does go for the scald so I can

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.620 
turn he does go for the scald so I can
pretty<00:02:54.630> much<00:02:54.720> wall<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.530> Slowking<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:57.210> two

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
pretty much wall this Slowking to two

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.810 
pretty much wall this Slowking to two
ages<00:02:58.050> pretty<00:02:58.380> much<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.190> go<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> sub

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
ages pretty much so I go for the sub

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.370 
ages pretty much so I go for the sub
here<00:03:00.060> he's<00:03:00.330> gonna<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.660> for<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> scold<00:03:01.170> I'm

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
here he's gonna go for the scold I'm

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.150 
here he's gonna go for the scold I'm
gonna<00:03:01.620> set<00:03:01.800> up<00:03:01.830> another<00:03:02.250> sub<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:04.070> against<00:03:05.070> a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220 
burning some things and that's pretty
much<00:03:14.520> what<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.880> does<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.240> wall<00:03:15.480> stuff<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.050> then

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
much what it does a wall stuff and then

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
much what it does a wall stuff and then
burn<00:03:16.680> stuff<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.880> ski<00:03:18.060> trend<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.450> probably

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
burn stuff and the ski trend is probably

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.350 
burn stuff and the ski trend is probably
one<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.110> my<00:03:19.290> favorite<00:03:19.740> heat<00:03:19.950> transects<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.820> is

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
one of my favorite heat transects it is

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780 
one of my favorite heat transects it is
one<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.870> one<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> those<00:03:22.680> smoke<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.220> sets<00:03:23.520> but

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
one of a one of those smoke on sets but

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.790 
one of a one of those smoke on sets but
it's<00:03:24.300> one<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.600> those<00:03:24.720> more<00:03:25.020> interesting<00:03:25.620> ones

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
it's one of those more interesting ones

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.000 
it's one of those more interesting ones
to<00:03:25.890> use<00:03:26.300> now<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.330> go<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.900> lava<00:03:28.110> plume<00:03:28.440> first

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
to use now I go for the lava plume first

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.860 
to use now I go for the lava plume first
turn<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.250> get<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.550> burn<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:30.360> perfect<00:03:30.750> I

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
turn I get the burn really perfect I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.320 
turn I get the burn really perfect I
usually<00:03:31.470> never<00:03:31.740> get<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.100> burn<00:03:32.330> especially

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
usually never get the burn especially

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.710 
usually never get the burn especially
once<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.780> only<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.230> 30%<00:03:34.830> chance<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:36.390> was

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
once it's only a 30% chance so that was

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.470 
once it's only a 30% chance so that was
absolutely<00:03:36.959> epic<00:03:37.800> now<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.760> am<00:03:39.090> gonna<00:03:39.360> switch

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
absolutely epic now I am gonna switch

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.440 
absolutely epic now I am gonna switch
out<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.800> am<00:03:40.920> gonna<00:03:41.070> go<00:03:41.310> into<00:03:41.700> my<00:03:41.730> n<00:03:42.000> mega<00:03:42.240> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
out and I am gonna go into my n mega to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.640 
out and I am gonna go into my n mega to
take<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.870> scald<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:44.220> know<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.490> can<00:03:44.760> take<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
take a scald and I know I can take it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.140 
take a scald and I know I can take it
because<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:47.250> looking<00:03:47.520> doesn't<00:03:47.910> really<00:03:48.030> have

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
because this looking doesn't really have

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.370 
because this looking doesn't really have
the<00:03:48.300> best<00:03:48.480> special<00:03:48.930> attack<00:03:49.200> especially

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
the best special attack especially

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.290 
the best special attack especially
wanted<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.040> support<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.910> know<00:03:50.970> it

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
wanted to support that and I know it

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.720 
wanted to support that and I know it
just<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.350> support<00:03:52.740> set<00:03:52.980> because<00:03:53.580> it

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
just it's a support set because it

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.690 
just it's a support set because it
carries<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.000> thunder<00:03:54.390> wave<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.070> yeah<00:03:56.070> he's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
carries the thunder wave and yeah he's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.070 
carries the thunder wave and yeah he's
gonna<00:03:56.820> get<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.060> crit<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.570> guess<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.930> doesn't

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
gonna get a crit I guess it doesn't

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.070 
gonna get a crit I guess it doesn't
matter<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.470> much<00:03:59.270> but<00:04:00.270> um<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.630> can<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:00.959> go

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
matter that much but um I can just go

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.530 
matter that much but um I can just go
into<00:04:01.200> my<00:04:01.410> my<00:04:01.590> executor<00:04:02.400> go<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.209> energy

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
into my my executor go for the energy

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.180 
into my my executor go for the energy
ball<00:04:03.720> because<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.080> stabs<00:04:04.380> super<00:04:04.770> effective

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
ball because it stabs super effective

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.070 
ball because it stabs super effective
and<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:06.090> doesn't<00:04:06.360> quite<00:04:06.510> take<00:04:06.840> him<00:04:06.990> out

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
and it doesn't quite take him out

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.810 
and it doesn't quite take him out
despite<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.590> fact<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.860> am<00:04:08.310> Mac's<00:04:08.670> special

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
despite the fact that am Mac's special

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.150 
despite the fact that am Mac's special
attack<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.660> exeggutor<00:04:10.200> does<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.950> some

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
attack and exeggutor does have some

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.630 
attack and exeggutor does have some
beast<00:04:11.459> special<00:04:12.180> attack<00:04:12.530> anyways<00:04:13.530> um<00:04:13.860> that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
beast special attack anyways um that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.340 
beast special attack anyways um that
tells<00:04:14.820> me<00:04:14.940> he's<00:04:15.090> probably<00:04:15.239> max<00:04:15.600> HP<00:04:15.840> max

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
tells me he's probably max HP max

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.320 
tells me he's probably max HP max
special<00:04:16.500> defense<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.190> am<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:17.880> gonna<00:04:17.940> take<00:04:18.209> him

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
special defense I am just gonna take him

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.320 
special defense I am just gonna take him
out<00:04:18.450> one<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.200> in<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.650> next<00:04:19.770> turn<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.330> he

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
out one more in the next turn and he

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.840 
out one more in the next turn and he
just<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.660> for<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.960> fire<00:04:22.290> blast<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.640> was

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
just go for the fire blast so that was

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.350 
just go for the fire blast so that was
really<00:04:24.030> interesting<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.630> don't<00:04:24.750> really<00:04:24.930> see

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
really interesting you don't really see

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.010 
really interesting you don't really see
at<00:04:25.949> that<00:04:26.949> move<00:04:27.159> quite<00:04:27.460> often<00:04:27.699> on<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> slow<00:04:28.750> King

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
at that move quite often on a slow King

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.170 
at that move quite often on a slow King
but<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.860> guess<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.400> works<00:04:30.580> out<00:04:30.759> on<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:30.969> fifth

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
but I guess it works out on the fifth

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.029 
but I guess it works out on the fifth
generation<00:04:31.719> because<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.169> all<00:04:32.319> the<00:04:32.469> nitori's

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
generation because of all the nitori's

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.350 
generation because of all the nitori's
in<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.909> metagame

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
in the metagame

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.110 
in the metagame
so<00:04:35.110> yeah<00:04:35.409> it's<00:04:35.620> gonna<00:04:35.830> actually<00:04:36.099> take<00:04:36.729> me<00:04:36.939> down

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
so yeah it's gonna actually take me down

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.700 
so yeah it's gonna actually take me down
to<00:04:37.300> star<00:04:37.539> four-engine<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.169> is<00:04:38.289> my<00:04:38.409> star

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.309 
to star four-engine this is my star
executory<00:04:39.370> again<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:40.300> really<00:04:40.870> awesome

executory again so really awesome
hopefully<00:04:42.009> I<00:04:42.039> go<00:04:42.250> for<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:42.550> can<00:04:42.699> go<00:04:42.789> for<00:04:42.939> the

protect maybe get a speed boost or a
evasion<00:04:46.180> boost<00:04:46.419> evasion<00:04:46.990> moves<00:04:47.199> would<00:04:47.289> be

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
evasion boost evasion moves would be

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.640 
evasion boost evasion moves would be
awesome<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.250> if<00:04:48.759> I<00:04:48.849> do<00:04:48.909> get<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.449> um<00:04:49.719> that
