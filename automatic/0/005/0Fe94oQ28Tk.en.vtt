00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.990
 sometimes people tell me look that's a 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.390
 topic 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.470
 because it seems reasonable great you 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.470
 you keep green 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.470
 next to red antenna 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.520
 ferry shape diversity 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.920
 White 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 be relevant 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.530
 a serious man 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.879
 yes 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.470
 and I still see look 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.470
 night 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.230
 is going to take the finger of the half friend is 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 recording video from the video 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.140
 it's trick do not think it's gimmicked 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.370
 but arriving 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.370
 you're really making me 2 in my 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.370
 back 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.500
 this light 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200
 do not 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 all right 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 my daughter 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.990
 after 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.990
 I do not have the shadow expense 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 good 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.319
 look if an airplane 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.630
 what I'm seeing if I would send in a 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.380
 plane approaching and the lights go by already 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 it would be rare 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.960
 they are near the sea supposedly they 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.200
 they are where the sea is not 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.730
 clear because they are far away and that light 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.960
 It must be very big to make it look so 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.230
 clear 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.210
 you must be above the sea that light is 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.240
 moved on walk did not move up 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.530
 and it disappeared 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.530
 because it is a little lower 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.920
 - 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.920
 could be 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.100
 and the one below 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.730
 decision 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.170
 bring your ipad so that it does not sign with those 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.170
 that comes out more vice 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.420
 I 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.940
 and it's the white background is that 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.540
 it descends more and more and more 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.540
 look at the sea
