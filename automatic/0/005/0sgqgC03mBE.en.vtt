00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.489
 hello greetings lbg malikí 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:28.909
 I will present you a game of chess that was developed in Rome in 1625 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:34.359
 departure is very interesting because even though it dates back a long time 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.120
 is very bright and keep in mind that sometimes you have to make a sacrifice of 

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.549
 stone with the aim of opening the attack position 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.540
 as we can see the white bishop can take the pawn of h7 and causing a check 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.590
 the king yaoundé the black king is already castled and although this is good here he 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.019
 advancement 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.850
 I remove the friar and white has not yet castled has no rapid threats and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.999
 that those horses and the dark bishop of the blacks are 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.200
 opposite of the white pieces of three minor pieces and the lady point to the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.810
 which they think is the best move for White something that is very 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.470
 energetic 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.960
 when taking in the session 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.400
 check now the king has to go to the square eight ago but I will show you the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.260
 variant in which you capture 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.010
 after horse g5 check 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 as white bandages follow the attack with a lot of energy 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.049
 you have to take the horse because otherwise White's attack would be decisive 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.460
 Now the rent is taken with the team, producing a check with discovered 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 the tower if the king lowers the pocho the game is more than decided 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.740
 because it would be septic and there is no way 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.830
 transcend the squares where the range can checkmate 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.030
 Now let's see and the king goes before 6, in the same way he grows tamarchete 5 check 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.910
 now the black king has little life was serious kings explained 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.610
 although it is the only box available for the fifth black king march three 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.620
 streets and from here is checkmate the world because if the king returns g6 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.089
 ladies and 7 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:15.119
 it would be checkmate 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:20.019
 and if the king was going to see four range of stress it would be checkmate of equal 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.189
 way 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.099
 now some asked 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.339
 what would happen if the bishop had not taken the horse in which 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.919
 and make any other movement 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.269
 example move the king of the g7 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.319
 then similarly tamarchete 5 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.529
 and as you see, Black loses more 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.779
 checkmate is threatened in the box towards sirte 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.989
 and there is no way to defend the position 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.069
 more than capturing the knight with the bishop 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.379
 as you see that horse had to take force 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.629
 the gunner is taken with him 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:02.189
 and you were threatened checkmate in two boxes h 7 18 as you see here the 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.579
 Blacks are more than losses 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.599
 I hope you liked it in videos and remember do not be afraid to sacrifice 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.379
 material 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.169
 If this sacrifice will leave us good compensation, it will accept coalition 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.619
 you can protect the king 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.010
 Have an excellent day, I told the country
