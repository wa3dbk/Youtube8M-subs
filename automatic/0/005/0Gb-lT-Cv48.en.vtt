00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
time to shine for Sporting Kansas City

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.870 
time to shine for Sporting Kansas City
but<00:05:40.199> we'll<00:05:40.349> see<00:05:40.529> if<00:05:40.620> he<00:05:40.740> can<00:05:40.889> shine<00:05:41.159> for<00:05:41.610> Haiti

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
but we'll see if he can shine for Haiti

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.909 
but we'll see if he can shine for Haiti
in<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.150> Gold<00:05:42.360> Cup<00:05:42.569> greg<00:05:43.110> now<00:05:43.289> it's<00:05:43.319> your<00:05:43.740> time

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
in the Gold Cup greg now it's your time

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.040 
in the Gold Cup greg now it's your time
to<00:05:43.979> shine<00:05:44.159> give<00:05:44.849> us<00:05:44.969> your<00:05:45.090> predictions<00:05:45.300> for

to shine give us your predictions for

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.360 
to shine give us your predictions for
group<00:05:46.349> B<00:05:46.529> well<00:05:46.889> I<00:05:46.949> think<00:05:47.039> it's<00:05:47.219> probably

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
group B well I think it's probably

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.399 
group B well I think it's probably
pretty<00:05:47.639> obvious<00:05:47.789> I<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.419> Honduras<00:05:48.990> running

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
pretty obvious I have Honduras running

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.170 
pretty obvious I have Honduras running
away<00:05:49.620> with<00:05:49.860> Group<00:05:50.099> B<00:05:50.279> in<00:05:50.460> this<00:05:50.639> one<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.090> then

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
away with Group B in this one and then

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.309 
away with Group B in this one and then
it's<00:05:51.330> going<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.539> be<00:05:51.630> closed<00:05:51.900> for<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.199> next

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
it's going to be closed for the next

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.529 
it's going to be closed for the next
three<00:05:52.710> but<00:05:53.190> I'm<00:05:53.430> going<00:05:53.639> to<00:05:53.699> trim<00:05:53.879> down<00:05:53.940> Tobago

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
three but I'm going to trim down Tobago

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.749 
three but I'm going to trim down Tobago
in<00:05:54.659> second<00:05:55.139> Haiti<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.949> third<00:05:56.279> and<00:05:56.580> El

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
in second Haiti and third and El

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.300 
in second Haiti and third and El
Salvador<00:05:57.360> going<00:05:57.719> home<00:05:57.960> early<00:05:58.139> and<00:05:58.620> speaking

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
Salvador going home early and speaking

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.309 
Salvador going home early and speaking
of<00:05:59.400> Haiti<00:05:59.639> in<00:05:59.789> this<00:05:59.940> case<00:06:00.210> I<00:06:00.449> think<00:06:00.690> they<00:06:01.110> pick

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
of Haiti in this case I think they pick

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.689 
of Haiti in this case I think they pick
up<00:06:01.469> enough<00:06:01.710> points<00:06:01.740> that<00:06:02.159> they're<00:06:02.310> one<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.520> the

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
up enough points that they're one of the

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.399 
up enough points that they're one of the
two<00:06:02.909> third-placed<00:06:03.479> teams<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.960> make<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.259> into

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
two third-placed teams to make it into

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:05.809 
two third-placed teams to make it into
the<00:06:04.500> quarterfinals<00:06:04.740> all<00:06:05.310> right<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.639> would

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
the quarterfinals all right that would

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.519 
the quarterfinals all right that would
be<00:06:06.029> a<00:06:06.060> surprise<00:06:06.719> there<00:06:06.990> you<00:06:07.080> have<00:06:07.199> it<00:06:07.229> Greg's

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
be a surprise there you have it Greg's
