00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.160
 download the files that you left in 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.160
 the description 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.940
 we are issuing our archives 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.260
 we have to install the pp 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.260
 that is the pp 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.530
 we installed it 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.160
 we hope it will be installed 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.670
 we give you finished 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 and now we have to look where we left 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.950
 our saved file of the fifa 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 street 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.530
 as rent and celtic 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.110
 we left here and we do not go to the pp that is 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.110
 the pp 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 we enter 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.090
 do not charge we 're going to game 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.270
 and at least in game it's not going 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.190
 to the folder of our archives and here 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.080
 they have to look 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.070
 and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.240
 and this is not going to scratch zero 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 me because himself flashlight that got together 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:57.690
 with cd memory is like this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.330
 and not look for the game I show you the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.330
 so they have to put on auction 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.920
 good as you see it is loading 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.840
 it does not work very well for me it contains two 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.510
 lrl buttons 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.510
 type is the same as the ppc 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.580
 a very good playability play 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.190
 I want to show the graphics 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.950
 one meter 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.239
 they do it backwards back 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:27.500
 disappear game where they are extinguished in 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:31.890
 the graphics in the audio have 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.650
 control in language systems 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.120
 they have many things 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.189
 that depends on the graphics that you 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.840
 want with whom in the audio the 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:51.050
 controls or not at all as you 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:55.580
 they want to be adjusted to suit 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.940
