of flexibility can easily then within

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.519 
of flexibility can easily then within
that<00:00:22.930> now<00:00:24.000> before<00:00:25.000> you<00:00:25.270> can<00:00:25.450> do<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:26.110> one<00:00:26.290> leg

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
that now before you can do the one leg

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.409 
that now before you can do the one leg
squat<00:00:26.919> obviously<00:00:27.669> you<00:00:27.730> have<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:27.939> be<00:00:28.119> able<00:00:28.180> to

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
squat obviously you have to be able to

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.979

do<00:00:28.570> squat<00:00:28.869> with<00:00:29.079> two<00:00:29.290> legs<00:00:29.939> however<00:00:30.989> when

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
do squat with two legs however when

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.780 
do squat with two legs however when
you're<00:00:32.110> standing<00:00:32.379> on<00:00:32.619> one<00:00:32.890> leg<00:00:32.920> your<00:00:33.579> body

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
you're standing on one leg your body

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.869 
you're standing on one leg your body
shifts<00:00:34.450> over<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.230> center<00:00:35.649> of<00:00:35.710> support<00:00:36.190> but

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
shifts over the center of support but

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.639 
shifts over the center of support but
this<00:00:37.059> being<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> best<00:00:37.719> way<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:37.989> train<00:00:38.469> it<00:00:38.620> to

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
this being the best way to train it to

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:47.060 
this being the best way to train it to
leg<00:00:39.010> squat<00:00:39.460> people<00:00:40.210> speak<00:00:40.480> together<00:00:41.400> like<00:00:42.400> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.500 

it's<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.190> good<00:00:48.310> idea<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.640> keep<00:00:48.880> your<00:00:48.940> arms<00:00:49.390> in

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
it's a good idea to keep your arms in

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.740 
it's a good idea to keep your arms in
front<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.130> shifts<00:00:51.610> your<00:00:52.180> balance<00:00:52.660> a

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
front because that shifts your balance a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.190 
front because that shifts your balance a
little<00:00:52.840> bit<00:00:53.050> back<00:00:54.540> allowing<00:00:55.540> for<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.960> stay

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
little bit back allowing for you to stay

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.330 
little bit back allowing for you to stay
on<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.739> leg

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
on one leg

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.900 
on one leg
we're<00:00:57.910> talking<00:00:58.270> about<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.710> flat<00:00:59.710> foot<00:01:00.010> one<00:01:00.700> leg

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
we're talking about a flat foot one leg

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.340 
we're talking about a flat foot one leg
squat<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:03.269> go<00:01:04.269> slowly<00:01:04.689> down<00:01:05.159> very<00:01:06.159> slowly<00:01:06.549> up

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
squat and go slowly down very slowly up

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.780 
squat and go slowly down very slowly up
things<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.560> another<00:01:08.710> side<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:12.299> few<00:01:13.299> issues<00:01:14.790> some

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
things in another side a few issues some

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.750 
things in another side a few issues some
people<00:01:16.180> do<00:01:16.360> not<00:01:16.540> have<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.110> strength<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.860> go<00:01:18.520> up

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
people do not have the strength to go up

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.480 
people do not have the strength to go up
and<00:01:18.970> down<00:01:19.090> on<00:01:19.330> one<00:01:19.360> leg<00:01:19.740> many<00:01:20.740> ways<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.250> train

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
and down on one leg many ways to train

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.630 
and down on one leg many ways to train
for<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:23.080> them<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.650> find<00:01:23.680> out<00:01:24.250> how

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
for that one of them is to find out how

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.600 
for that one of them is to find out how
low<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:24.940> can<00:01:25.240> go<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.290> work<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:27.130> range<00:01:27.430> of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
low you can go and work on that range of

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.190 
low you can go and work on that range of
movement<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.900> for<00:01:29.140> instance<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:30.600> find<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.900> I

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
movement so for instance I find that I

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.520 
movement so for instance I find that I
can<00:01:32.530> go<00:01:32.710> down<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.040> here<00:01:33.640> if<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.479> go<00:01:34.720> any<00:01:34.990> lower

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
can go down to here if I go any lower

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.450 
can go down to here if I go any lower
I<00:01:35.560> cannot<00:01:36.040> come<00:01:36.280> back<00:01:36.520> up<00:01:37.500> Thanks<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.310> what<00:01:39.430> I

would do is I would come down to here
that's<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.549> point<00:01:42.850> where<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.240> can't<00:01:43.659> push

down to here extend your leg back other
leg<00:02:35.400> back<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.720> after<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.080> while<00:02:38.260> you'll<00:02:38.620> be

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
leg back and after a while you'll be

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.920 
leg back and after a while you'll be
able<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.130> come<00:02:39.340> down<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.730> little<00:02:40.000> low<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:45.930> come

able to come down a little low and come

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.710 
able to come down a little low and come
up<00:02:47.110> okay<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.280> then<00:02:48.910> we'll<00:02:49.090> build<00:02:49.299> up<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
up okay and then we'll build up the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.009 
up okay and then we'll build up the
strength<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.680> come<00:02:50.920> down<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.519> come<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:52.019> that

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
strength to come down and come up that

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.920 
strength to come down and come up that
takes<00:02:53.319> care<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.980> strengths<00:02:54.489> issue<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
takes care of the strengths issue in the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.949 
takes care of the strengths issue in the
leg<00:02:56.140> that's<00:02:56.410> actually<00:02:56.830> doing<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.190> squat

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.699 

another<00:03:01.959> issue<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:03.400> way<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:05.350> ways<00:03:05.530> to

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
another issue is this way the ways to

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.740 
another issue is this way the ways to
take<00:03:05.920> care<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.370> if<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.180> feel<00:03:07.359> like<00:03:07.570> you're

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
take care of it if you feel like you're

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.710 
take care of it if you feel like you're
coming<00:03:08.109> down<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:09.120> touching<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> flow<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
body to shift to set them down a little

body to shift to set them down a little

bit that this way sitting back no

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.699 
bit that this way sitting back no
constantly<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:38.359> second<00:03:38.780> way<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.019> take<00:03:39.469> care

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
constantly the second way to take care

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.330 
constantly the second way to take care
of<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.099> straight<00:03:40.430> leg<00:03:40.730> is<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:42.769> use<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:42.980> strap

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
of the straight leg is to use a strap

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.599 
of the straight leg is to use a strap
they<00:03:43.579> wind<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.969> up<00:03:45.040> I'm<00:03:46.040> gonna<00:03:46.280> put<00:03:46.489> this

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
they wind it up I'm gonna put this

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.429 
they wind it up I'm gonna put this
turban<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.209> my<00:03:47.419> foot<00:03:48.489> hold<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.669> pretty<00:03:49.849> low

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
turban on my foot hold it pretty low

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.589 
turban on my foot hold it pretty low
because<00:03:51.439> my<00:03:51.769> arms<00:03:52.099> in<00:03:52.219> my<00:03:52.250> leg<00:03:52.579> won't<00:03:53.150> have<00:03:53.389> to

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
because my arms in my leg won't have to

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.780 
because my arms in my leg won't have to
travel<00:03:53.870> up<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.709> have<00:03:54.889> to<00:03:54.919> start<00:03:55.250> low

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
travel up so I have to start low

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.909 
travel up so I have to start low
let's<00:03:56.239> quite<00:03:56.540> down<00:03:58.329> come<00:03:59.329> back<00:03:59.359> up<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.709> is

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
let's quite down come back up this is

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.459 
let's quite down come back up this is
actually<00:04:01.370> easier<00:04:01.790> because<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.870> do<00:04:03.019> not<00:04:03.139> have<00:04:03.199> to

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
actually easier because I do not have to

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.240 
actually easier because I do not have to
focus<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:04.069> hold<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.609> leg<00:04:04.849> up<00:04:06.250> I'm

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
focus and hold it this leg up I'm

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.039 
focus and hold it this leg up I'm
holding<00:04:07.669> it<00:04:07.819> up<00:04:07.939> with<00:04:08.120> my<00:04:08.269> hands<00:04:08.689> rather<00:04:08.900> than

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
holding it up with my hands rather than

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:18.029 
holding it up with my hands rather than
its<00:04:09.799> own<00:04:10.040> strength<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:16.549> two<00:04:16.759> ways<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.120> solve<00:04:17.419> it

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
its own strength so two ways to solve it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.170 
its own strength so two ways to solve it
one<00:04:19.039> way<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.750> it's<00:04:20.750> quite<00:04:21.079> down<00:04:21.880> with<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.000> leg

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
one way is it's quite down with the leg

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.360 
one way is it's quite down with the leg
Bend<00:04:23.509> and<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.110> other<00:04:24.199> one<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.860> home<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
Bend and the other one is to home to the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.839 
Bend and the other one is to home to the
strut<00:04:25.699> and<00:04:29.650> again<00:04:30.650> that's<00:04:30.860> also<00:04:31.099> solves<00:04:31.699> the

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
strut and again that's also solves the

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.700 
strut and again that's also solves the
issue<00:04:31.880> of<00:04:32.240> flexibility<00:04:32.930> because<00:04:33.080> some<00:04:33.440> people

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
issue of flexibility because some people

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.589 
issue of flexibility because some people
don't<00:04:33.889> have<00:04:34.159> enough<00:04:34.490> flexibility<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:35.419> this

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
don't have enough flexibility in this

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.159 
don't have enough flexibility in this
way<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.919> bring<00:04:37.099> it<00:04:37.310> up<00:04:37.630> if<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.750> do<00:04:38.960> have

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
way that you bring it up if you do have

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.890 
way that you bring it up if you do have
the<00:04:39.320> flexibility<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.599> possibly<00:04:41.599> not<00:04:41.840> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
the flexibility and possibly not the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.170 
the flexibility and possibly not the
strength<00:04:42.409> or<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.099> have<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.400> flexibility<00:04:44.060> and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
strength or you have the flexibility and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.180 
strength or you have the flexibility and
you<00:04:44.360> would<00:04:44.479> like<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.810> play<00:04:45.020> around<00:04:45.259> you<00:04:46.009> can

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
you would like to play around you can

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.120 
you would like to play around you can
answer<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.520> whole<00:04:46.759> display<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.889> it's<00:04:48.889> quite

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
answer a whole display and it's quite

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.339 
answer a whole display and it's quite
down<00:04:49.370> with<00:04:49.699> it<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.889> come<00:04:52.250> back<00:04:52.430> up<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.870> sit<00:04:54.199> on

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
down with it and come back up and sit on

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:02.600 
down with it and come back up and sit on
the<00:04:54.440> other<00:04:54.560> side

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.790 

the<00:05:03.060> last<00:05:03.270> possible<00:05:03.810> issue<00:05:04.080> here<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.680> the

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
the last possible issue here is the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.249 
the last possible issue here is the
balance<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.940> course<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.419> have<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.750> be<00:05:06.870> able<00:05:07.080> to

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
balance of course you have to be able to

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.960 
balance of course you have to be able to
balance<00:05:07.800> on<00:05:07.979> one<00:05:08.009> leg<00:05:09.560> okay<00:05:10.560> before<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.819> can

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
balance on one leg okay before you can

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.420 
balance on one leg okay before you can
do<00:05:12.090> anything<00:05:12.409> other<00:05:13.409> commence<00:05:13.889> moving<00:05:14.340> the
