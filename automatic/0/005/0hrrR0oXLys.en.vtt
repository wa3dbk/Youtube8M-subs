them this footage is actually kind of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.369 
them this footage is actually kind of
old<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:50.309> you'll<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.879> old<00:00:51.050> chat<00:00:52.050> box

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
old I think you'll see the old chat box

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
old I think you'll see the old chat box
actually<00:00:52.739> pop<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
actually pop up here and there so it's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.920 
actually pop up here and there so it's
quite<00:00:55.289> quite<00:00:55.680> old<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:57.149> thought<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.870> was

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
quite quite old but I thought it was

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.319 
quite quite old but I thought it was
fitting<00:00:58.170> considering<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.850> video<00:01:00.090> yesterday

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
had noticed about that game in terms of

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.040 
had noticed about that game in terms of
weapon<00:04:01.830> balance<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.580> things<00:04:02.790> that

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
weapon balance and just things that

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.710 
weapon balance and just things that
didn't<00:04:04.050> really<00:04:04.519> rub<00:04:05.519> me<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.670> right<00:04:05.910> way<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.660> to

didn't really rub me the right way so to
speak<00:04:07.080> all<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:08.100> those<00:04:08.190> things<00:04:08.250> were<00:04:08.670> kind<00:04:08.850> of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
speak all of those things were kind of

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.420 
speak all of those things were kind of
niggling<00:04:09.420> at<00:04:09.570> me<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.050> bothering<00:04:10.739> me<00:04:10.980> on<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.130> rig

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430

niggling at me and bothering me on a rig
a<00:04:11.610> very<00:04:11.910> regular<00:04:12.150> basis<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.840> at<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.290> point

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
a very regular basis and at that point

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.560 
a very regular basis and at that point
in<00:04:13.800> time<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.900> was<00:04:15.900> raging<00:04:16.769> way<00:04:17.010> too<00:04:17.070> hard<00:04:17.570> at

company 2 for a while and that was a bad

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.110 
company 2 for a while and that was a bad
time<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:35.919> definitely<00:04:36.099> not<00:04:36.490> something

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
time that was definitely not something

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.050 
time that was definitely not something
that<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:37.539> should<00:04:37.900> have<00:04:37.930> let<00:04:38.289> happen<00:04:38.590> and

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
that I should have let happen and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.460 
that I should have let happen and
thankfully<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.090> really<00:04:40.479> haven't<00:04:40.630> had<00:04:40.810> issues

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
like that since then I've learned to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.460 
like that since then I've learned to
play<00:04:45.160> each<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.150> every<00:04:46.360> game<00:04:46.569> that<00:04:46.599> I<00:04:46.840> own<00:04:47.080> in

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
moderation and it's definitely helped me

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.170 
moderation and it's definitely helped me
out<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.620> know<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.740> still<00:04:50.889> play<00:04:51.370> battlefield<00:04:51.910> 3

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180

out you know I still play battlefield 3
on<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.479> very<00:04:52.750> regular<00:04:52.960> basis<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:54.550> think<00:04:54.849> that

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
on a very regular basis and I think that

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.920 
on a very regular basis and I think that
it<00:04:55.210> has<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.870> number<00:04:56.440> of<00:04:56.590> flaws<00:04:57.009> I<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:58.419> think<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
it has a number of flaws I I think that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.879 
it has a number of flaws I I think that
it's<00:04:59.080> still<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.830> very<00:05:00.070> good<00:05:00.400> game<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.349> with<00:05:02.349> the

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
it's still a very good game and with the

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.550 
it's still a very good game and with the
proper<00:05:03.160> updates<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.360> patches<00:05:04.539> and<00:05:05.020> changes<00:05:05.530> i

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
proper updates and patches and changes i

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.040 
proper updates and patches and changes i
think<00:05:05.979> it<00:05:06.099> could<00:05:06.250> be<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.430> really<00:05:06.940> awesome<00:05:07.389> game

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
think it could be a really awesome game

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.570 
think it could be a really awesome game
like<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> truly<00:05:09.039> great<00:05:09.370> game<00:05:09.910> um<00:05:11.160> but<00:05:12.160> until
