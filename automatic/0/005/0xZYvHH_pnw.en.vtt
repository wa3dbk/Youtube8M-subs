00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.410
 It's finally back to a threesome edition and you want 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.920
 that he has classic big game he is dazzling in front and wood of the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.589
 Son from Holzheim now her son that is a month 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.710
 Confusion may not know yet 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.830
 it's about 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.160
 Different words can help a hoster to find letters from letters 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.859
 always reassembled mining claims 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.399
 Variant 1 and you have to try from there according to certain rules 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.269
 as many clouds and rain time 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.780
 Spillman and then when the top players get drunk as the whole team said 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.909
 that the two whole system works the everyday if that works 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.159
 funny today is an asset to the US 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.540
 Before we can start we have to be plain and simple more 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.989
 make for this because of this edition 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.609
 who interesting variant was us 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.300
 You can go through the door of this gold here 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.550
 the dice 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.120
 put in the soil kg give milk refer Verk 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.180
 No, you can improve your plan in children and adolescents 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 and then how can relatively free here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 but would still be a solar register that they are against 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.800
 keep the left still if you had it very violent led discussion 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.250
 developed 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.780
 really messed up here too diseases yes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 but if that is a bit too successful 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.680
 you can see that, strangely enough, we'll just go back 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.610
 Falling back into this grid I do not know how that works 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.090
 but it worked and then I just do not care 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120
 of which back this must be together 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.550
 and Allah has really done a complete pair of these 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.010
 we can now defy games after the usual uncommon cold 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.370
 also times and to which year a whole lot of different 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.200
 Letters and now just look for where to drop the letter outside with 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.020
 the banks as the first letter of a word and no one is 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.929
 an adjacent city park second letter and from there the it 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.840
 adjoining tribal conquest has been adapted so far and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.569
 To find supporters 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.829
 Gunnar should perhaps be told back from 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.349
 These are only available to GPRS and India but also to this duel 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.239
 this TG Selm that the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.299
 Kubon week frontally tipped into the left side and she has every year 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.629
 it will be hard to find something here 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.559
 if it has won the Patt Head etailer should go 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.579
 or 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.579
 Delfs, however, you can take that 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.829
 kath net / kna come 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.569
 it is very difficult to find something sometimes you can be bad but it was 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.649
 always like this 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.549
 then the sender has to guess the death some still goes the rule at least 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.969
 three letters provided with simplified must in group b 407 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.619
 Of course, what should not be done? "Maybe too 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.699
 in the light of the scoreless and no names of their own 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.709
 maybe also no English words social research much more 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.769
 collect the principle 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.969
 if you close it again this meeting Inter 90 Euro expensive cultivation like 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.749
 you see and they were funny colors or sometimes fast 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.510
 slow what is actually so important at some point is such a total 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.540
 At first there is a cross and you know it is over, time is up 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.340
 what once three minutes and then look at the most runners now 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.829
 Matthes has rerouted BZ and pen quickly written down Magnum and 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.049
 then we look at the most words he does best whoever wins the guess 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.389
 not me 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.620
 Yes, you can only say the EU their expenses Top team falls behind the 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:39.519
 Game basically stays the same, of course, once had belonged 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.230
 meanwhile known every time to create a new flexible word 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.890
 You look for Dortmund under 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600
 on Essener side was next to buy in Christmas fever over the net 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.930
 say the citizens silver is not just as much the original 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.780
 Superspiel box office tickets really well liked 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.829
 and this is joie de vivre and works 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.409
 Vienna this plastic packed greed is of course also Matthias Rothhammer 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.919
 do not fly around in dice in the big council that's not so easy 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.209
 Followed the whole works as I am very very much 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.539
 good dancing is always forbidden and it can still happen 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.980
 That sometimes things may be many teens many East Resources what comes 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.060
 that one does not find so many people out of not so bad you have to 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.549
 look for them a little bit more instead of just dropping dollars off 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.300
 will write 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.379
 So I do not want that last, because I'm good at Hamacher, that they really are 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.370
 works it says "although it works just fine, so it must always be firm 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.520
 set and with a good sauce is partly too long to be so 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.020
 just a little earlier, you found Petrus more exhausting by Steffen 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.009
 Make Flath or as well as Maximilian Panthen eternal times 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.759
 because they are so I personally find myself for the newspaper then 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.849
 not so plump if you tried the animals Alonso was who 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.080
 with life we ​​want to prevent that the switch in the picturesque 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.599
 Giving a backdrop to know so you get a bit the pace also permanently 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.759
 but it is not so wild for people you can still see well 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.969
 how about that also that Israel no disadvantages if you are of course so 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.960
 It does not always have to be different if we do not have a unique format 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.560
 Personally it was the citizens expensive because of it still better 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.740
 you can not call a little bit know but that is 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.449
 after all, there is no longer there and everyone demanded but he missed and and and 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.139
 the person there is no redhead little open 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.300
