00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.740 
little tricky but it is possible unlike
what<00:02:14.800> everyone<00:02:15.190> else<00:02:15.220> says<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:16.480> what<00:02:16.690> you

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
what everyone else says that what you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.250 
what everyone else says that what you
want<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.990> do<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:18.700> call<00:02:18.880> Lydian<00:02:19.360> or

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
want to do is put call Lydian or

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.880 
want to do is put call Lydian or
whatever<00:02:20.500> game<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.890> doing<00:02:21.160> here<00:02:21.340> like<00:02:21.640> usual

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
whatever game you doing here like usual

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.290 
whatever game you doing here like usual
put<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> case<00:02:24.190> back<00:02:24.220> I'll<00:02:24.670> make<00:02:24.850> sure<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.030> on

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
put the case back I'll make sure it's on

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.060 
put the case back I'll make sure it's on
secure<00:02:25.780> because<00:02:25.960> otherwise<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.710> just<00:02:26.830> going

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
secure because otherwise it's just going

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.370 
secure because otherwise it's just going
to<00:02:27.160> go<00:02:27.310> crazy<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:27.880> now<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
to go crazy in there now you have to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.370 
to go crazy in there now you have to
open<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.920> tray<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.430> close<00:02:31.120> again<00:02:31.450> because<00:02:31.780> in

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
open the tray and close again because in

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.710 
open the tray and close again because in
essence<00:02:32.830> registers<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.490> there<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.880> right<00:02:37.030> now

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
essence registers in there all right now

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.880 
essence registers in there all right now
you<00:02:37.780> got<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.050> do<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> same<00:02:38.410> thing<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.770> before

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
you got to do the same thing as before

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.010 
you got to do the same thing as before
just<00:02:39.130> wait<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.730> load<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:45.810> all<00:02:46.810> right

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
just wait for this to load up all right

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.660 
just wait for this to load up all right
now<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:47.860> gotta<00:02:48.070> wait<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.430> guy<00:02:48.640> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
now you just gotta wait for this guy to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.140 
now you just gotta wait for this guy to
load<00:02:48.910> up

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.479 

okay<00:02:53.959> now<00:02:54.680> it's<00:02:54.860> going<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.040> come<00:02:55.189> up<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.370> the

to achieve the samsung drive that
everyone<00:03:42.260> says<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.709> impossible<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.310> mod<00:03:43.519> with

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
everyone says is impossible to mod with

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.910 
everyone says is impossible to mod with
and<00:03:43.939> hot<00:03:44.060> swap<00:03:44.329> and<00:03:44.629> here's<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.620> one<00:03:45.769> with<00:03:45.889> the

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
magnet everyone else uses there you go

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.390 
magnet everyone else uses there you go
now<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.870> can<00:03:51.079> prove<00:03:51.379> that<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.250> one
