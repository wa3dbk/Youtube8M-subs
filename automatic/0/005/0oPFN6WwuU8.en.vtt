pilot main China but this will get rid

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.030 
pilot main China but this will get rid
of<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.670> rust<00:00:28.660> issue<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.140> have<00:00:29.439> with<00:00:29.470> those<00:00:29.770> old

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
of the rust issue I have with those old

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.330 
of the rust issue I have with those old
lights<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:31.240> these<00:00:31.960> are<00:00:32.140> 100<00:00:32.470> watts<00:00:32.739> or<00:00:33.220> my

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
lights and these are 100 watts or my

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
lights and these are 100 watts or my
other<00:00:33.519> ones<00:00:33.790> were<00:00:34.030> 55<00:00:35.580> so<00:00:37.559> better<00:00:38.559> light<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
other ones were 55 so better light I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.400 
other ones were 55 so better light I
think<00:00:42.790> it'll<00:00:43.210> look<00:00:43.390> good<00:00:43.540> on<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.930> bulbar<00:00:44.290> of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
think it'll look good on the bulbar of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.160 
think it'll look good on the bulbar of
course<00:00:44.650> I'll<00:00:45.489> have<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.760> get<00:00:45.879> new<00:00:46.030> covers<00:00:47.159> but

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
course I'll have to get new covers but

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.840 
course I'll have to get new covers but
anyway<00:00:50.170> that's<00:00:50.409> going<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.799> be<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.549> next

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
anyway that's going to be the the next

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.660 
anyway that's going to be the the next
thing<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.150> go<00:00:52.180> on<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.570> truck<00:00:53.489> probably<00:00:54.489> put

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
thing to go on the truck probably put

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.310 
thing to go on the truck probably put
them<00:00:54.879> on<00:00:55.089> well<00:00:55.629> I'll<00:00:55.690> put<00:00:55.839> them<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.019> right

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
them on well I'll put them on right

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.899 
them on well I'll put them on right
after<00:00:56.470> I<00:00:56.620> get<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.860> oil<00:00:57.040> cooler<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:58.839> it

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.509 
after I get the oil cooler back on it
installation<00:01:00.909> should<00:01:01.089> be<00:01:01.150> pretty<00:01:01.540> easy<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.489> I

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
installation should be pretty easy so I

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.250 
installation should be pretty easy so I
just<00:01:03.729> have<00:01:03.909> to<00:01:04.680> gather<00:01:05.680> scopes<00:01:06.040> cups<00:01:07.260> I'll

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
just have to gather scopes cups I'll

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.510 
just have to gather scopes cups I'll
have<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.560> look<00:01:08.650> through<00:01:08.830> there<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.070> find<00:01:09.220> out

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
have to look through there and find out

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.230 
have to look through there and find out
what<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.729> want<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:09.970> use<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:12.240> installation

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
what I want to use but installation

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.960 
what I want to use but installation
should<00:01:13.420> be<00:01:13.600> pretty<00:01:13.840> easy<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:15.460> I've<00:01:15.700> already

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
should be pretty easy as I've already

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.960 
should be pretty easy as I've already
got<00:01:16.060> all<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.240> wires<00:01:16.450> running<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.049> harnesses

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
got all the wires running the harnesses

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.850 
got all the wires running the harnesses
have<00:01:18.970> those<00:01:19.180> those<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.170> probably<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.620> half

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860
