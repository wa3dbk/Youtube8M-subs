00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and to focus now on what would be the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 last official day of autumn this 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.210
 season tomorrow at 2 and 2 at noon 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 peninsular time we will enter the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 winter increase for today then 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.020
 day that repeats itself situation 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 similar to what we have had 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.859
 we started this week, look, because 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.020
 again we will talk today of abundant 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.510
 cloudiness in a good part of that country 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.369
 another if frontal that stops today and returns to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.359
 approaching from the west and I would go back 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.310
 to leave that situation 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.199
 as we say repeated with 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 precipitations that will be more intense 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.940
 especially in the late afternoon 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 affecting again the province to the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 community of galician to galicia 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.649
 extending towards the northern third 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 peninsular and in the morning if it is true 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 that the compact cloudiness that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 we found at this time I would leave some 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.059
 weak showers in general in good 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 part the interior of the northern plateau in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.670
 the river and even the community of madrid 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.340
 in the morning towards Extremadura 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.129
 will already defend to weaken in the face of 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.120
 late and more if the somewhat more clear 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.039
 that we have left in areas of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.979
 Mediterranean and that for today we find 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.330
 as a novelty the absence of these mists 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.659
 that have been accompanying us in days 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.119
 before 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.100
 is that the atmosphere at the level of 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.749
 surface is not as static as in 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.329
 other occasions like other days and so 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.759
 we only find low clouds or fogs 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.189
 morning mist has been interior of 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.409
 Andalusia or the interior of the community 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.060
 catalan catalonia in the archipelago 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 canary also formed calm with 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.479
 predominance of sun some after e again 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.849
 that medium medium high without major 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.579
 consequence the temperatures continue without 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.380
 great changes for today still values 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.719
 quite nice on this last day 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.399
 of the autumn as you can buy we will return 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.069
 to rub even the 20 degrees in the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.469
 delmi terráneo or 24 25 punctually in 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.509
 the Canarian archipelago well now 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.239
 we are already on this weekend 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.670
 what is special already arrives at poinsettia 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.860
 Christmas comes we wonder how it is going to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.509
 evolve the time in these days of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.429
 moment for the weekend it seems that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.189
 the anticyclone is reinstalled in the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.899
 peninsula would leave even by the north 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.090
 in a coruña for example where yesterday 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.409
 they accumulate almost 80 liters per 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.420
 square meter at the moment the end of 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.160
 week they tend to remit slightly 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590
 these rains and already on Sunday by the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.060
 night another disturbance returns for the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.319
 West color already leave skies something more 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.719
 cutlery 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.760
 and a drop in temperatures in areas 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.739
 from the center or in the south of the peninsula 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.349
 also runs the situation repeats 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.269
 will be quite similar would be facing the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.069
 Monday when we could even be 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.139
 some shower with a thermal descent 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.480
 similar situation for the day 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.150
 25 Christmas with more cloudiness some 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.709
 drop and with temperatures falling and in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
 the Mediterranean formed something more 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 quiet though it is true that here 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.900
 facing Tuesday yes that for example in 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.010
 Catalonia could even reach some 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.079
 drop in any case the temperatures 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.439
 and that they are already descending towards the day of 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.439
 good night
