the<00:04:58.270> height<00:04:58.450> paint<00:04:58.720> them<00:04:58.870> into<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.110> corner<00:04:59.530> I

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
the height paint them into a corner I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.410 
the height paint them into a corner I
think<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.920> whole<00:05:00.010> thing<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.310> like<00:05:00.520> most<00:05:01.300> of

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
think the whole thing is like most of

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.210 
think the whole thing is like most of
the<00:05:01.480> hype<00:05:01.630> came<00:05:01.930> out<00:05:02.200> before<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.890> album<00:05:03.190> came

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
the hype came out before the album came

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.720 
the hype came out before the album came
out<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:03.970> they<00:05:04.630> had<00:05:04.750> an<00:05:04.900> opportunity<00:05:05.140> to

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
out so they had an opportunity to

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.040 
out so they had an opportunity to
preempt<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.790> height<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.210> like<00:05:07.390> defy<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.840> a

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
little which is really smart of them so

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.420 
little which is really smart of them so
