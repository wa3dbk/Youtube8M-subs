00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
how it works you give somebody the deck

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
how it works you give somebody the deck
of<00:00:40.260> cards<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> ask<00:00:41.070> them<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> shuffle

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
of cards and you ask them to shuffle

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360 
of cards and you ask them to shuffle
that's<00:00:42.510> step<00:00:42.840> number<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.920> spectator

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's step number one so your spectator

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
that's step number one so your spectator
is<00:00:44.640> shuffling<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> cards<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.680> you

is shuffling the cards like so you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.150 
is shuffling the cards like so you
instruct<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> stop<00:00:48.690> whenever<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.829> want

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
instruct them to stop whenever they want

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
need to know is one card you're then

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.609 
need to know is one card you're then
going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> spread<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> cards<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> table

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
people actually keep their thumbs on it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.749 
people actually keep their thumbs on it
as<00:01:33.630> they're<00:01:33.960> mixing<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.460> keep<00:01:35.610> an

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
as they're mixing I think just keep an

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.990 
as they're mixing I think just keep an
eye<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> fine<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.680> effective<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.820> well

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
eye on it is fine as effective as well

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
eye on it is fine as effective as well
just<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.799> magic<00:01:41.250> it's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
just like this you know in magic it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
just like this you know in magic it's
very<00:01:41.670> important<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> reiterate<00:01:43.320> what

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
very important when you reiterate what

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
very important when you reiterate what
just<00:01:43.920> happened<00:01:44.399> okay<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> shuffled<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
just happened okay so you shuffled this

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.020 
just happened okay so you shuffled this
deck<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.409> cards<00:01:46.799> are<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:46.979> complete<00:01:47.460> random

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
deck the cards are in complete random

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
deck the cards are in complete random
order<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.829> them<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
order is that right you get them to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
order is that right you get them to
agree<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.329> more<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.899> them

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
agree with you the more you get them

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.980 
agree with you the more you get them
shaking<00:01:52.500> their<00:01:52.860> head<00:01:53.130> forward<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.720> more

shaking their head forward the more

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
shaking their head forward the more
amazing<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.799> trick<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.880> then

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
amazing the trick is going to be so then

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.980 
amazing the trick is going to be so then
here's<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> do

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
