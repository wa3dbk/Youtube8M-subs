00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.220 
very impressive package if anybody's
thinking<00:02:17.670> about<00:02:18.060> buying<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.660> these<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
thinking about buying one of these I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.199 
thinking about buying one of these I
think<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> only<00:02:20.340> thing<00:02:20.459> you've<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.940> look

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
think the only thing you've got to look

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.080 
think the only thing you've got to look
out<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:23.340> getting<00:02:23.640> wrong<00:02:23.820> with<00:02:24.000> an

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
out for is not getting wrong with an

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.259 
out for is not getting wrong with an
undersized<00:02:24.540> engine<00:02:25.850> which<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.030> pretty

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
undersized engine which is pretty

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.979 
undersized engine which is pretty
unlikely<00:02:27.450> anyway<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.519> also<00:02:29.660> you've<00:02:30.660> got<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
unlikely anyway and also you've got to

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.979 
unlikely anyway and also you've got to
get<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:32.209> interiors<00:02:33.209> right<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:33.810> like

the moment in time this is about as good

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.280 
the moment in time this is about as good
as<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.040> gets<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.940> vehicles

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
as it gets with vehicles
