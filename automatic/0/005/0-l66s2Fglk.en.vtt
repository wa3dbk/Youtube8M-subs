Norton dodge was very preoccupied with

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.320 
Norton dodge was very preoccupied with
certain<00:03:56.410> themes<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:57.190> was<00:03:57.700> apparent<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.300> the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
certain themes it was apparent in the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.990 
certain themes it was apparent in the
60s<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:58.930> 70s<00:03:58.959> when<00:03:59.560> he<00:03:59.680> was<00:03:59.830> collecting<00:04:00.340> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
60s and 70s when he was collecting that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.710 
60s and 70s when he was collecting that
there<00:04:01.240> were<00:04:01.510> certain<00:04:02.130> taboos<00:04:03.270> very<00:04:04.270> clear

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
there were certain taboos very clear

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.290 
there were certain taboos very clear
taboos<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.190> collection<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.940> think

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
taboos and the collection I think

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.660 
taboos and the collection I think
originally<00:04:07.569> was<00:04:08.050> formed<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.800> a<00:04:09.400> way<00:04:09.520> around

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
originally was formed in a way around

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.240 
originally was formed in a way around
them<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.300> one<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.870> them<00:04:11.020> was<00:04:11.230> in<00:04:11.470> fact<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:12.100> use

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
them so one of them was in fact the use

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.340 
them so one of them was in fact the use
of<00:04:12.280> religious<00:04:12.819> imagery<00:04:13.180> another<00:04:14.050> very

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
of religious imagery another very

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.259 
of religious imagery another very
important<00:04:14.800> one<00:04:14.950> for<00:04:14.980> Norton<00:04:15.400> was<00:04:15.489> abstraction

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
important one for Norton was abstraction

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.650 
important one for Norton was abstraction
and<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:17.380> he<00:04:18.070> really<00:04:18.400> started<00:04:18.760> off<00:04:18.910> looking<00:04:19.180> at

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
and so he really started off looking at

00:04:19.660 --> 00:05:10.570 
and so he really started off looking at
work<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.919> had<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.310> as<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.489> subject
