that<00:04:37.440> my<00:04:37.590> lashes<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:38.100> gotten<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.460> lot<00:04:38.580> longer

that my lashes have gotten a lot longer
but<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:42.300> cons<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.140> like<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.740> also<00:04:44.010> read<00:04:44.370> this

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
but the cons of it like I also read this

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.790 
but the cons of it like I also read this
before<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.120> side<00:04:45.300> effects<00:04:45.630> are<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:46.350> like<00:04:46.590> it

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
before the side effects are that like it

before the side effects are that like it
made<00:04:47.040> my<00:04:47.160> eyes<00:04:47.190> bloodshot<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.000> next<00:04:48.240> day<00:04:48.360> did

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
made my eyes bloodshot the next day did

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.660 
made my eyes bloodshot the next day did

my eyes didn't hurt it off they were

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.420 
my eyes didn't hurt it off they were
just<00:04:50.790> bloodshot<00:04:51.090> looking<00:04:51.660> red<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.430> another

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
just bloodshot looking red and another

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.650 
just bloodshot looking red and another
problem<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:56.640> had<00:04:56.880> with<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.450> did<00:04:57.570> not

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
problem that I had with it is it did not

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.960 
problem that I had with it is it did not
make<00:04:57.840> my<00:04:58.020> lashes<00:04:58.260> any<00:04:58.650> thicker<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.580> only<00:04:59.730> made

make my lashes any thicker it only made
them<00:05:00.120> longer<00:05:00.560> but<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.590> guess<00:05:01.890> I<00:05:02.630> could<00:05:03.630> still

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.110 
them longer but I guess I could still
use<00:05:03.840> my<00:05:04.110> false<00:05:04.380> eyelashes<00:05:04.920> for<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.220> speaking
