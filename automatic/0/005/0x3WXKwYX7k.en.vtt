all<00:02:21.610> over<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.090> place<00:02:22.330> I'd<00:02:22.510> be<00:02:22.630> not<00:02:22.810> securing

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it and I just secure it the same way I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.210 
it and I just secure it the same way I
secure<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.840> wig<00:02:26.140> cap<00:02:26.410> I'm<00:02:26.860> just<00:02:27.100> suggesting

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
secure that wig cap I'm just suggesting

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.320 
secure that wig cap I'm just suggesting
a<00:02:27.700> little

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.150 

oh<00:02:34.270> right<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.630> like<00:02:35.930> using<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.410> headband<00:02:36.920> with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
oh right so I like using a headband with

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.700 
oh right so I like using a headband with
this<00:02:37.310> particular<00:02:37.580> wig<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.390> just<00:02:38.780> looks<00:02:39.260> good

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
this particular wig it just looks good

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.160 
this particular wig it just looks good
and<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.130> helps<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.430> hide<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.790> ugly<00:02:41.330> part<00:02:41.780> look

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and it helps to hide that ugly part look

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.060 
and it helps to hide that ugly part look
anyway<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.910> basically<00:02:44.600> am<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:45.650> kind<00:02:45.890> of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
anyway so I basically am just kind of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.220 
anyway so I basically am just kind of
maneuvering<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.940> wig<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:48.110> know

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
maneuvering the wig so that you know

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.740 
maneuvering the wig so that you know
it's<00:02:48.440> hiding<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:48.950> edges<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.570> like

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
it's hiding my edges and I really like

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.810 
it's hiding my edges and I really like
this<00:02:50.960> because<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.680> cuts<00:02:52.070> down<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.460> some<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
this because it cuts down on some of the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.510 
this because it cuts down on some of the
bulk<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.360> keeps<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.900> week<00:02:54.080> more<00:02:54.380> secure<00:02:54.950> to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
bulk and keeps the week more secure to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.400 
bulk and keeps the week more secure to
my<00:02:55.670> head<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:57.050> hair<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.260> looking
