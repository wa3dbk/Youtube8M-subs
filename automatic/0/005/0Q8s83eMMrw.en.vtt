00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:10.599
 paralysis for what asshole and so 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.599
 I want to kill you to take it for ass no longer 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.850
 there are good to all vaquitas we are in 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.560
 minecraft guys I bring is piece of 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.630
 super cooking this time what are we going to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.280
 to be able to do is to paralyze any bots 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.320
 you will like it is similar to the 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.520
 antich creepers but hey you're a 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.070
 little bit more epic to see what they take off 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.470
 the pigs or this busting us and good 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.059
 life will explain from scratch it's worth it 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.770
 is plugged in to create and I tell you I've 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.320
 left the command the description that 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.350
 now we will try it and well I'm in 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.270
 this city full of mods as you can 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.610
 see vale there is of all chickens people that 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.050
 attacks a lot of these pigs and 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.130
 well I'm going to get the first person and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.170
 The first thing I'm going to do is that I want 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:54.320
 You see, I'm going to put it on 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.540
 we are going to launch the option and since it has 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 past I can not do anything at all 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.649
 It's worth as you see now in 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.600
 speed I have it paralyzed by 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.089
 complete and equal jump increment 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.799
 you stay like this you can not do anything 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.869
 so good to cure them you know 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.780
 you drink milk that is super good 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.509
 and you can activate, this is worth it in a 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.210
 creative server you can create one but 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.140
 fat then also worth his rival 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.240
 because you are going to be able to perform 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.030
 any way that he now gives me in his 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.100
 rival and what are you going to see and well we are going to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.539
 start the mess to create it simply 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.490
 get a command block you know 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.959
 that to get it is to put git your 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.899
 Username 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.000
 137 and a 1 to get the block of 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.170
 commands ok we put a button and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.789
 good the command is in the description 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.890
 I'll explain a little bit 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.219
 basically what we do is add 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.709
 about 64 you can change the bottle 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.289
 I'm going to put another different one that does not 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.879
 be pink for example the 2 and good 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.700
 simply what we do is to customize 

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:54.379
 two of the effects that we have are worth and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.439
 put the infinities is as you can see 

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.239
 here the light 1 of the first effect is worth 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.189
 we put it infinite and here in second 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.989
 effect we also put it infinite what 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.819
 what it does is paralyze us and speed 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.229
 it does not leave it to zero, it's worth the name 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.200
 we can change it and put we can 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.910
 put what we want is worth 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.209
 but of paralysis so good if I go to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:19.269
 put on it paralysis epic paralysis 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.819
 and we accept it now you are going to see I am going to 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.950
 take away a little bit of stuff we're going to 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.450
 get it and well the jar is different 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.470
 it's green but good the paralysis is still 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.060
 being as you can see the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.940
 speed does not leave it to zero is worth less 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.400
 10 percent speed and it says good 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.840
 I'll put in your rival and you'll see how 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.299
 it would work this you have to have 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.430
 careful because you have to throw it to 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.569
 four blocks away if you could not 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.130
 give a fat voucher 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.190
 I just paralyzed that pig but 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.650
 well I'm going to put the survival I have 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 fear and let's see if this works its 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.050
 rival or not let's get to memo 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 have the uppercase game or of s 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.570
 and it's coming over here we all do like this is 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.130
 he has thrown over to take care I 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.750
 I say that he killed by asshole that 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.670
 I'm not worth anything, let's go back to 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.960
 go I have here the portions in hands already 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.120
 that in total it has not happened absolutely 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.120
 nothing the only thing that you take care with 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.950
 that because if you cast it less than 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.720
 four blocks or you're going to take it 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:24.810
 you have sections that paralysis 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.610
 why for what asshole and now if 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.000
 I want I kill you Come take me for ass now 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.860
 and what the asshole we're going to serve 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.060
 comes another one here it's worth look 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.060
 baby is that you who are there 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.920
 and it's super epic to see who attacked me 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.810
 archer you another come another who takes 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.340
 the potion there is an hour that is not going to 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.340
 to be able to keep shooting I think now 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.959
 watch 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.489
 yes but obviously it's worth it and in this way 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.480
 we can paralyze everyone is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.269
 super emit and then we kill him 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.730
 quietly then they will dance since 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.140
 we have here that we are going to do is and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.140
 we can go killing all those who 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.940
 we want or we hesitate that bothers you 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.230
 super epic the potion and good guys 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.480
 I hope you liked it and you can 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.770
 use it with any mode it's worth 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.490
 only thing I ask is that you can like 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.660
 below you have the description 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.670
 first the block code of 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.160
 commands when they copy it is to look at that 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.980
 I do not know perfectly well because sometimes 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.230
 it looks like mini loquitos like that and you have to 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.790
 remove them valÃ¨ncia that copy the good and 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.290
 nothing if we connect the next one always if 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.210
 you have to use up the process to 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.010
 people photo I like that I have not 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.910
 said that we failed but here that you 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.910
 bust with the options 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.430
 why
