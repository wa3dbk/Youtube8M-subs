00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
was super super dark and I didn't want

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.969 
was super super dark and I didn't want
it<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.810> dark<00:01:12.810> anymore<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.470> summer<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it to be as dark anymore for summer I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.320 
it to be as dark anymore for summer I
just<00:01:14.490> wanted<00:01:14.790> something<00:01:15.030> different

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

otherwise i think i may have probably
cut<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.630> hair<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.020> i<00:01:19.500> didn't<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> cut<00:01:20.009> it

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
because i felt like maybe that

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.500 
because i felt like maybe that
temperature<00:03:27.709> would<00:03:28.430> be<00:03:28.760> suitable<00:03:29.060> for<00:03:29.299> my

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
temperature would be suitable for my

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.390 
temperature would be suitable for my
hair<00:03:29.720> type<00:03:29.930> because<00:03:30.199> i<00:03:30.229> have<00:03:30.470> thick<00:03:30.769> kinky

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
hair um yeah it wasn't too too too high

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.699 
hair um yeah it wasn't too too too high
so<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:35.479> of<00:03:35.720> course<00:03:35.930> some<00:03:36.229> could<00:03:36.379> argue<00:03:36.409> that

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
so I'm of course some could argue that

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.649 
so I'm of course some could argue that
350<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.459> probably<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.970> little<00:03:38.120> bit<00:03:38.299> too<00:03:38.479> high

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
350 is probably a little bit too high

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.930 
350 is probably a little bit too high
