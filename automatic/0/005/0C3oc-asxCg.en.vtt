00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.190
 so hello friends today there again 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.650
 one with patrick for you me 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.680
 answer today one of the most requested 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.140
 ask in my comments at all 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.789
 every day under every single video thing 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.900
 Upload to ask anyone 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.989
 how that works out 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.360
 without switching dome and extra for 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.120
 I have the video today 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.860
 quick shift sensor unplugged 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.390
 can not imagine anything 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.030
 quick shift is a system 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.129
 What if you switch for a short time 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.050
 moment the ignition interrupts and in 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.629
 this short moment where the load stops 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.420
 away is the next gear in 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.550
 I usually do that with it 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.059
 without a quick shift you can without 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 problems without coupling switch first 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.440
 Many people always ask that beforehand 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.090
 is not harmful for the gear 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.520
 this does not significantly increase the service life 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.960
 no, she is not the only one 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 ever driven a motorcycle 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 looked at from the inside is also 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.880
 see it for the gear 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.210
 it does not matter if he is with us now 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.340
 Clutch switches or without because now 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.950
 switch operation exactly the same 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.470
 process expires it is just 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.200
 important that the driveline of 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.690
 gear does not carry any load while you 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.580
 wanted to insert the next course that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.560
 you can now achieve one hand 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.510
 in that you just disconnect then 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.440
 the engine is disconnected from the gearbox and 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.070
 now more no desire on the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.470
 powertrain 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.909
 or by simply taking away gas like that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 Do you do it when you are without 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.530
 Clutch switches you call them one 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 short moment the gas is gone then exactly 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.150
 so much even if you pull the clutch 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 the load on the drive train away and 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.560
 the next gear can without problems purely 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.920
 flutschen so the practice sees it then 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920
 like this 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.150
 You see, that's not hard at all 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.170
 it does not jerk or so if I 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.020
 now, for example, switch down 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.640
 would like to 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.000
 It works as you can see without 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.830
 clutch which would downshift 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.130
 I really do not recommend without coupling 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.660
 because you have to be extremely practiced 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.830
 Being around always the right one 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.600
 speed to hit 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.100
 and if you are not the right one 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.380
 speed meets then that can ever 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.300
 really violent crash in the gearbox 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.390
 is really harmful but 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.819
 upshift 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.350
 is not really a problem everything 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.470
 what you have to do to upshift 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.840
 Your foot ever to the rocker 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.569
 turn down from below so that ever 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.460
 So minimal pressure on it is then the animal 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.230
 the gas gone 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.610
 and at the same moment you pull the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.010
 lever with the foot completely upwards 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.290
 and gives gas again 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 and that's it, there's more 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.980
 not and the advantage is that it is 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.650
 much much faster than what works 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.510
 switch with violence only briefly once 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.489
 Search again gas must forward is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.079
 the next gear in and you have to stop 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.519
 do not take away first gas then the 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.610
 clutch then pull the next gear 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.980
 insert 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.470
 then get back clutch and 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.890
 give gas but the whole thing is with 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.750
 upshift done a gesture 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.070
 without coupling is no problem 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.070
 I do that all day long 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.310
 this damages the gearbox 0 the gearbox 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.050
 he does not care if he does 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 the clutch used or not 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.040
 So far, find this video 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.330
 Helpful is then you can me 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.860
 like to leave a thumb up there 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.510
 if he wants to see me you can 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.030
 I also like to subscribe and if 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.530
 you have done that then we will see each other 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.470
 also very soon again 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.830
 and bye bye and until then 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.830
 next time
