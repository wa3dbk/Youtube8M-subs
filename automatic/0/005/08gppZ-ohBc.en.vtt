00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.070 

you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.300 

and<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.320> play<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.740> over<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.220> over

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
and you just play that over and over

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.360 
and you just play that over and over
again<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:16.790> pretty<00:01:17.000> simple<00:01:17.240> right<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:18.170> now

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
again it's pretty simple right and now

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.080 
again it's pretty simple right and now
we<00:01:19.370> begin<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.860> first<00:01:22.130> chord<00:01:22.640> you're<00:01:22.940> going

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
we begin so the first chord you're going

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:34.660 
we begin so the first chord you're going
to<00:01:23.180> play<00:01:25.060> contains<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.630> D<00:01:28.180> F<00:01:29.180> sharp<00:01:30.880> MVA<00:01:33.670> so

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
to play contains the D F sharp MVA so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.890 
to play contains the D F sharp MVA so
yeah<00:01:36.520> sounds<00:01:37.520> pretty<00:01:37.640> doesn't<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.150> but<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.810> go

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
yeah sounds pretty doesn't it but you go

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.930 
yeah sounds pretty doesn't it but you go
to<00:01:38.960> set<00:01:39.110> play<00:01:39.590> each<00:01:39.830> note<00:01:39.860> separate<00:01:40.490> not<00:01:40.760> like

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
to set play each note separate not like

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.550 
to set play each note separate not like
a<00:01:40.970> chord<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.540> said<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.810> was<00:01:41.930> going<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.200> sorry

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
a chord like I said I was going to sorry

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.580 
a chord like I said I was going to sorry
but<00:01:43.280> uh<00:01:43.310> here's<00:01:43.970> how<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.210> goes<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.960> rhythm<00:01:45.170> I'm

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
but uh here's how it goes the rhythm I'm

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:57.600

going<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.830> play<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:45.980> slowly<00:01:46.250> for<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.790> guys

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:09.550 

then<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.700> play<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:58.940> over<00:01:59.000> again<00:02:08.260> so<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.320> play

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
then you play it over again so you play

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:20.290 
then you play it over again so you play
that<00:02:09.679> twice<00:02:10.120> so<00:02:11.120> should<00:02:11.600> sound<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:11.900> this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.200

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.220 
don't know which know that I'm sorry a
sharp<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.540> other<00:02:41.690> time<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:44.020> it's<00:02:45.020> pretty

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
sharp the other time and a it's pretty

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.930 
sharp the other time and a it's pretty
much<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.100> cord<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.670> played

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
much just like the cord you played

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.200 
much just like the cord you played
before<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:47.810> instead<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.770> addy<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.490> play<00:02:49.700> C<00:02:52.210> so

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
before but instead of addy you play C so

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.170 
before but instead of addy you play C so
it's<00:02:53.990> pretty<00:02:54.110> easy<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.740> know<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.550> transfer

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
it's pretty easy you know just transfer

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:05.170 
it's pretty easy you know just transfer
from<00:02:56.390> doing<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:59.150> doing<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.340> you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
from doing this to doing this so you you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.500 
from doing this to doing this so you you
played<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.740> over<00:03:06.740> again<00:03:06.770> choice<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:08.300> play

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
played that over again choice you play

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:21.140 
played that over again choice you play
this<00:03:08.720> twice<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.500> go<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:09.710> this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
