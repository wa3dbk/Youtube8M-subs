00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
we're just producing a sculpt mesh here
so<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:04.379> important<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.729> know

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

something that looks a like like this

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.760 
something that looks a like like this
the<00:01:18.119> only<00:01:18.270> bad<00:01:18.420> thing<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.720> i<00:01:19.080> don't<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.500> the

the only bad thing is i don't have the
third<00:01:20.220> completed<00:01:21.119> area<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the aerial view so i'm going to have to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
the aerial view so i'm going to have to
rely<00:01:27.119> heavily<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.640> ability<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.180> go

in here and round up and I do that by

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.450 
in here and round up and I do that by
going<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:37.340> remember<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> keep

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
and now I have this ramesh skin that

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.610 
and now I have this ramesh skin that
looks<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.739> lot<00:03:27.859> like<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> lot

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
looks a lot like this this is a lot

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.709 
looks a lot like this this is a lot
better<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.189> sculpt<00:03:32.180> on<00:03:32.269> than<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> other<00:03:33.079> one<00:03:33.290> I

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 
better to sculpt on than the other one I

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.199 
better to sculpt on than the other one I
can't<00:03:35.719> go<00:03:35.810> any<00:03:35.959> lower<00:03:36.730> but<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.760> don't<00:03:38.000> need<00:03:38.150> to

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
can't go any lower but I don't need to

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.349 
can't go any lower but I don't need to
yet<00:03:38.659> because<00:03:39.650> I'm<00:03:39.920> just<00:03:40.189> developing<00:03:40.849> a<00:03:41.000> form

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
yet because I'm just developing a form

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.830 
yet because I'm just developing a form
in<00:03:41.569> order<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.349> lay<00:03:42.739> down<00:03:42.769> topology<00:03:43.549> I<00:03:46.840> will

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
in order to lay down topology I will

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.990 
in order to lay down topology I will
need<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.139> polish<00:03:48.349> this<00:03:48.650> um<00:03:48.889> so<00:03:49.579> I'm<00:03:49.819> going<00:03:49.969> to

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
need to polish this um so I'm going to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.210 
need to polish this um so I'm going to
go<00:03:50.150> down<00:03:50.299> here<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:51.040> polish

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.250 

and<00:03:58.340> that'll<00:03:59.060> just<00:03:59.240> relax<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.780> lot<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.050> stuff

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
and that'll just relax a lot of stuff

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.730 
and that'll just relax a lot of stuff
and<00:04:00.550> then<00:04:01.550> activate<00:04:02.300> symmetry<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.020> I'm<00:04:03.590> just

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
and then activate symmetry and I'm just

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.610 
and then activate symmetry and I'm just
going<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:03.980> smooth<00:04:04.460> out<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:05.120> form<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.620> i'm

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
going to smooth out this form to i'm

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.250 
going to smooth out this form to i'm
going<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.830> do<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.100> without<00:04:07.990> having<00:04:08.990> the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
going to do that without having the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.090 
going to do that without having the
other<00:04:09.530> stuff<00:04:09.950> visible<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:12.110> i<00:04:12.140> can<00:04:12.440> use<00:04:12.590> solo

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
other stuff visible so i can use solo

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.670 
other stuff visible so i can use solo
mode<00:04:13.430> here<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:15.170> work<00:04:15.320> just<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:16.010> one<00:04:17.680> and

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
mode here to work just on this one and

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.319 
mode here to work just on this one and
I'm<00:04:18.859> just<00:04:19.010> kind<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.280> rounding<00:04:19.790> things<00:04:20.060> up

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
I'm just kind of rounding things up

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.080 
I'm just kind of rounding things up
making<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.959> less<00:04:21.109> boxy<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:22.700> way<00:04:22.880> when<00:04:23.060> I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
making it less boxy that way when I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.790 
making it less boxy that way when I
start<00:04:23.420> pulling<00:04:24.320> forms<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:26.650> matching<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
start pulling forms and matching it to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.420 
start pulling forms and matching it to
my<00:04:28.040> image<00:04:28.220> planes<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:31.130> not<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.520> bad<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:33.430> just

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
my image planes it's not so bad and just

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.830 
my image planes it's not so bad and just
kind<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.640> use<00:04:34.790> your<00:04:34.940> imagination<00:04:35.630> on<00:04:35.750> the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
kind of use your imagination on the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.720 
kind of use your imagination on the
skull<00:04:36.110> right<00:04:36.290> now<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:37.190> don't<00:04:37.340> have<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.550> use

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
skull right now you don't have to use

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:47.890 
skull right now you don't have to use
the<00:04:37.850> image<00:04:38.120> planes<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.630> do<00:04:38.780> this

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.249 

now<00:04:48.470> as<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.770> as<00:04:49.310> an<00:04:49.880> illustrator<00:04:50.419> would<00:04:50.780> you

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
now as a as an illustrator would you

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.110 
now as a as an illustrator would you
know<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.410> say<00:04:51.919> an<00:04:52.130> illustrator<00:04:52.580> probably<00:04:53.030> would

know I say an illustrator probably would

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.159 
know I say an illustrator probably would
just<00:04:53.419> go<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.870> use<00:04:54.050> this<00:04:54.229> form<00:04:54.639> this<00:04:55.639> is<00:04:55.790> where

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
just go and use this form this is where

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.230 
just go and use this form this is where
you<00:04:57.169> separate<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:58.009> illustrator<00:04:58.460> from<00:04:58.850> the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
you separate the illustrator from the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.020 
you separate the illustrator from the
actual<00:04:59.780> game<00:04:59.810> artist<00:05:00.770> they<00:05:01.520> would<00:05:01.759> take<00:05:01.970> it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
actual game artist they would take it

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.719 
actual game artist they would take it
and<00:05:02.360> they<00:05:02.570> need<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.930> Paula<00:05:03.169> G<00:05:03.410> or<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.340> animator

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
and they need to Paula G or the animator

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.180 
and they need to Paula G or the animator
would<00:05:04.940> need<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.240> apology<00:05:05.660> because<00:05:06.350> this<00:05:06.979> big

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
would need to apology because this big

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.570 
would need to apology because this big
block<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.490> goo<00:05:08.410> could<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.560> transverse<00:05:10.160> into

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
block of goo could that transverse into

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:20.010 
block of goo could that transverse into
another<00:05:10.850> program<00:05:11.000> that's<00:05:11.810> why

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.909

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
okay once you are done with this process

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.900 
okay once you are done with this process
