 color is the mascara that to me 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.779
 more I like that I already bought with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 other masks that I've had and that for 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.730
 it's me that gives me the best result 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 the maximum mark is color was put on 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.770
 Contact me because they told me that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.829
 they loved the videos that I made 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.739
 of reviews of their masks then 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.649
 They decided to send me a kit with all the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.750
 products that they handle I never 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 wait for me to send so many products 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 I was waiting for about five masks 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.859
 and some oil or something super normal 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.260
 Then he came to my house in MÃ©rida 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.119
 right now I see the box j 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.740
 and agro and wow are a lot of things that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.689
 I have to try 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.880
 and more or less so that you in a 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.220
 idea this is more or less the amount of 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.110
 things that they sent me from among 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.869
 masks and other products that I do not 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.030
 I had no idea what was driving them maximum is 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.369
 color the regular line of maximums me 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.560
 they sent all the colors that I think 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.420
 are in existence these are some of 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.780
 what you already knew that is the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.880
 pink that I have the one of green and this that 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.400
 was the one who wanted to prove just that 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.710
 it's mamey's 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.180
 what is it like that an orange color we 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.960
 three colors that I did not know that 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.090
 they had never seen them 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 in equal 2 that was where I the I 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.690
 I got these masks at the beginning 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.500
 this is coconut oil is 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.200
 it's just mamey oil and it's 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.180
 it's with mamey bone but also the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 black that I had already tried and it is 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.420
 excellent that is for the eyelashes 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.979
 plate and also to the heights them 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.899
 but it's a way like it 's a formula 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.850
 as very light to put your 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.430
 Tabs could I not even bring them 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.260
 and the truth is that it is very light with 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.930
 I really have already uncovered this 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.480
 book first our three post 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.880
 we did that I did not know they were from the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.820
 same mark these I have seen in the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.850
 sanborns are now castor oil 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.340
 they gave me mamey and they gave me tea 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.810
 green and they sent me these same 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.530
 of post we did but it's like another 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.540
 version that is called ostentation and every 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.439
 one brings different brushes 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.750
 and they bring different ingredients the line 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.049
 post and yes more but this is like a range 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.480
 more professional and it's one more price 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.409
 I have seen them in samborns as 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.060
 in a hundred pieces of pesos that come like this 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.370
 that are supposed to have six microns 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.810
 They have 6 microns that are as if they were 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.220
 small pieces that are sticking 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.400
 the tabs to make them more more 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.340
 long and they bring the spherical brush 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.050
 they sent two liquid eyeliners one 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.950
 that is supposed to be indelible and one that 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.630
 it is normal to have mineral pigments 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.330
 what are these two are of post and if more 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.730
 then maximum actions are like 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.760
 two different ranges of the same brand 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.680
 they sent me this oil of maximums that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.780
 it's supposed to be like a treatment with 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.730
 which you will des maquillas and right there 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.130
 you are giving the masahito that brings several 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.630
 types of natural oils and if more 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.430
 professional also sent me this 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.260
 make-up remover that brings oil and is 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.540

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.180

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.630
 they sent me this make-up remover that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.880
 It is biphasic an exfoliating cleanser 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.060
 if here it says that it is of eyes face and 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.590
 lips and that in four weeks you're going to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.330
 have a clearer newer skin 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.790
 because of the exfoliation it gives you in my 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.450
 life had seen this I did not know that 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.270
 have a maxi lic 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.110
 It's like a silica for hair and there's 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.440
 several flavors smells I want that at 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.150

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.850
 teach everything that I do everything that I 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.669
 they got the ones from the maximus brand 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.620
 but I could not recommend everything 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.710
 they gave me because they will have to prove it 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.720
 everything to be able to me with certainty like 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.130
 always she sankyo I'm super honest 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.010
 that I do not recommend anything that I do not 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.320
 have approved first to tell them if it is 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.380
 good is not good or if it is good has 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.240
 this project against then let me 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.790

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.790
