if<00:01:49.829> people<00:01:50.489> had<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.509> newfound<00:01:52.170> appreciation

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
if people had some newfound appreciation

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.649 
if people had some newfound appreciation
whether<00:01:53.129> it's<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.429> near-death<00:01:53.909> experiences

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
whether it's from near-death experiences

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.779 
whether it's from near-death experiences
whether<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.349> from<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.640> psychedelics<00:01:56.640> with

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789

it's from meditation whatever it is I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800 
it's from meditation whatever it is I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
addicted to the internet but we're stuck

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.190 
addicted to the internet but we're stuck
in<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.740> wacky<00:02:29.040> momentum<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.780> only<00:02:31.020> thing

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
in a wacky momentum and the only thing

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.110 
in a wacky momentum and the only thing
in<00:02:31.560> my<00:02:31.590> experience<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.760> changes<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.110> a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
in my experience that changes that is a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.840 
in my experience that changes that is a
complete<00:02:36.120> reconstruction<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.920> how<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.430> view

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
complete reconstruction of how you view

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.760 
complete reconstruction of how you view
the<00:02:39.000> world<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:40.020> only<00:02:40.140> way<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.380> do<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.709> is

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
the world and the only way to do that is

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.040 
the world and the only way to do that is
to<00:02:40.890> step<00:02:41.370> away<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.510> have<00:02:42.690> some<00:02:43.020> sort

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
to step away you have to have some sort

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.360 
to step away you have to have some sort
of<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:44.120> disconnect<00:02:45.120> some<00:02:45.900> sort<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.380> an

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
of a disconnect some sort of an

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.479 
of a disconnect some sort of an
experience<00:02:47.970> where<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.410> an<00:02:49.650> objective

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
experience where you get an objective

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.040 
experience where you get an objective
look<00:02:50.520> at<00:02:50.940> things<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.420> first<00:02:51.660> time<00:02:51.840> you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
look at things for the first time you

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.699 
look at things for the first time you
look<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:52.410> things<00:02:52.620> as<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.340> were<00:02:53.489> someone

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
look at things as if you were someone

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.110 
look at things as if you were someone
completely<00:02:55.709> unattached<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.459> every<00:02:56.790> single

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the people around with you but you get

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.120 
the people around with you but you get
to<00:03:00.209> see<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.570> but<00:03:00.930> mapped<00:03:01.380> out<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.769> front<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.040> you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
to see it but mapped out in front of you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.000 
to see it but mapped out in front of you
clearly<00:03:02.640> cleanly<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:03.750> no<00:03:03.900> ego<00:03:04.380> with<00:03:04.860> no

financial repercussions with you know
just<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.260> get<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.769> see<00:03:07.920> what<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.370> is

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
just you get to really see what it is

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.539 
just you get to really see what it is
and<00:03:08.880> that's<00:03:09.450> fucking<00:03:10.170> possible<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:11.340> most
