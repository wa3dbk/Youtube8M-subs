00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.349 
cardboard piece that protects the tail
you<00:02:00.139> can<00:02:00.289> see<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.159> die<00:02:01.340> low<00:02:01.609> and<00:02:01.819> it's

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
you can see it's on the die low and it's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.209 
you can see it's on the die low and it's
on<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.630> Ceratosaurus<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:03.649> they<00:02:03.740> can<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.069> be

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
on the Ceratosaurus and they can just be

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.429 
on the Ceratosaurus and they can just be
removed<00:02:04.759> by<00:02:05.420> pulling<00:02:05.719> on<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.170> little<00:02:06.289> bit

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
removed by pulling on it a little bit

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.440

and<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.159> can<00:02:07.310> see<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.789> will<00:02:07.909> slide<00:02:08.090> right

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and you can see that it will slide right

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.840 
and you can see that it will slide right
off<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.780> packaging<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.560> now<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.920> can<00:02:10.340> access

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
off the packaging and now you can access

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.430 
off the packaging and now you can access
one<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.270> sounds<00:02:11.810> which<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.020> can<00:02:12.140> press

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.479 

makes<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.230> cool<00:02:19.439> spinning<00:02:19.980> noise<00:02:20.159> now

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
makes a really cool spinning noise now

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.509 
makes a really cool spinning noise now
the<00:02:21.120> frills<00:02:21.450> will<00:02:21.659> also<00:02:21.989> go<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.439> but<00:02:23.129> Joey

the frills will also go out but Joey

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.720 
the frills will also go out but Joey
will<00:02:23.730> talk<00:02:23.909> more<00:02:24.120> about<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.389> in<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.930> review

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
will talk more about that in just review

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.399 
will talk more about that in just review
next<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:26.969> have<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.209> cerrado<00:02:27.569> source<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> it's

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
next we have the cerrado source and it's

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.440 
next we have the cerrado source and it's
probably<00:02:28.680> one<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.099> my<00:02:29.340> favorite<00:02:29.790> figures<00:02:30.209> in

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
probably one of my favorite figures in

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750 
probably one of my favorite figures in
the<00:02:30.749> jurassic<00:02:31.230> world<00:02:31.439> line<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.189> we've

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the jurassic world line because we've

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.879 
the jurassic world line because we've
been<00:02:32.909> waiting<00:02:33.209> forever<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.659> Ceratosaurus<00:02:34.620> to

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
been waiting forever for Ceratosaurus to

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.920 
been waiting forever for Ceratosaurus to
have<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.069> toy<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.670> finally<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.299> have<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.569> not

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
have a toy and finally we have it not

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.420 
have a toy and finally we have it not
only<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.439> it<00:02:37.650> looks<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.219> one<00:02:38.400> from

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
only that it looks like the one from

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.110 
only that it looks like the one from
Jurassic<00:02:39.150> Park<00:02:39.389> 3<00:02:39.719> so<00:02:40.349> it's<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:41.370> really

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
Jurassic Park 3 so it's really really

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.809 
Jurassic Park 3 so it's really really
cool<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.659> love<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.409> figure<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.129> cannot

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
cool I love this figure and I cannot

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.759 
cool I love this figure and I cannot
wait<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> review<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.659> this<00:02:46.049> one<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.439> will<00:02:46.650> be

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
will probably be one of either Wednesday

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.390 
will probably be one of either Wednesday
or<00:02:50.909> Thursday<00:02:50.939> videos<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.349> that'll<00:02:53.099> be<00:02:53.219> really

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
or Thursday videos so that'll be really

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.539 
or Thursday videos so that'll be really
cool<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:54.000> show<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.209> guys<00:02:54.419> and<00:02:55.129> you<00:02:56.129> can<00:02:56.280> see

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
cool to show you guys and you can see

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.089 
cool to show you guys and you can see
that<00:02:56.939> just<00:02:57.689> like<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.109> Dilophosaurus<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:58.980> has

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
that just like the Dilophosaurus it has

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.800 
that just like the Dilophosaurus it has
that<00:02:59.250> little<00:02:59.370> cardboard<00:02:59.939> piece<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.599> tail

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
that little cardboard piece on the tail

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.780 
that little cardboard piece on the tail
and<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.650> could<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:01.829> get<00:03:02.099> removed<00:03:02.459> by

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and that could just get removed by

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.330 
and that could just get removed by
pulling<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.840> off<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.439> one's<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.799> bit<00:03:04.949> harder

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
pulling it off this one's a bit harder

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.649 
pulling it off this one's a bit harder
to<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.699> but<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.959> see<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.709> got<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.219> and

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
to do but you can see that I got it and

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.179 
to do but you can see that I got it and
that's<00:03:09.659> what<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.019> does<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.949> tail

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
that's what that does and the tail

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.699 
that's what that does and the tail
feature<00:03:11.719> is<00:03:12.719> a<00:03:12.780> biting<00:03:13.169> feature<00:03:15.439> so<00:03:16.439> they're

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
feature is a biting feature so they're

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.009 
feature is a biting feature so they're
both<00:03:16.980> really<00:03:17.489> great<00:03:17.730> figures<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.659> have<00:03:18.840> to

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
both really great figures and I have to

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.219 
both really great figures and I have to
say<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.500> love<00:03:20.280> them<00:03:20.459> both<00:03:20.669> they're<00:03:21.449> really<00:03:21.989> nice

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
say I love them both they're really nice

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.259 
say I love them both they're really nice
very<00:03:22.709> high<00:03:22.889> quality<00:03:22.949> and<00:03:23.609> if<00:03:23.699> you<00:03:23.790> guys<00:03:23.909> have

very high quality and if you guys have

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.509 
very high quality and if you guys have

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.490 
can buy them on Hasbro toy shop comm for
$14.99<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.540> definitely<00:03:30.959> worth<00:03:31.259> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
$14.99 so it's definitely worth the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.999 
$14.99 so it's definitely worth the
money<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.609> be<00:03:32.909> warned<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.900> also<00:03:34.079> you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.780 
have to also pay for tax and for
shipping<00:03:37.139> so<00:03:37.859> that<00:03:38.009> brings<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.370> price<00:03:38.549> for

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
shipping so that brings the price for

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.849 
shipping so that brings the price for
both<00:03:38.879> of<00:03:39.060> these<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.419> about<00:03:39.750> $40<00:03:40.590> that's

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
both of these up to about $40 that's

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.920 
both of these up to about $40 that's
what<00:03:40.979> it<00:03:41.069> was<00:03:41.129> like<00:03:41.189> for<00:03:41.519> me<00:03:41.699> when<00:03:41.909> both<00:03:42.780> of

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
what it was like for me when both of

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.300 
what it was like for me when both of
these<00:03:42.989> if<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.319> buy<00:03:43.560> them<00:03:43.769> in<00:03:43.859> stores<00:03:44.099> will

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
these if you buy them in stores will

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.399 
these if you buy them in stores will
probably<00:03:44.579> be<00:03:44.669> around<00:03:44.849> 30<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.359> 34<00:03:45.930> including

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409
