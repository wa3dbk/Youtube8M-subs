00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.279 
additional add-on check my other videos
I'm<00:04:36.830> going<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.039> do<00:04:37.760> a<00:04:37.789> video<00:04:38.060> on<00:04:38.210> doing<00:04:39.200> the

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
I'm going to do a video on doing the

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.920 
I'm going to do a video on doing the
modification<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.130> get<00:04:40.250> those<00:04:40.450> up<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.690> running

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
modification to get those up and running

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.339 
modification to get those up and running
so<00:04:42.770> they're<00:04:42.919> both<00:04:43.099> on<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.610> high<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:43.880> low<00:04:43.940> beam

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
so they're both on for high and low beam

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.690 
so they're both on for high and low beam
is<00:04:45.349> a<00:04:45.410> little<00:04:45.740> better<00:04:45.889> shot<00:04:46.130> of<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.370> display

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
is a little better shot of the display

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.379 
is a little better shot of the display
on<00:04:46.849> this<00:04:47.030> one

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.140 

the<00:04:51.930> fuel<00:04:52.770> tank<00:04:53.069> on<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:54.240> Zuma<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.050> little

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
the fuel tank on the Zuma is a little

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.570 
the fuel tank on the Zuma is a little
awkward<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.360> fill<00:04:58.139> I<00:04:58.409> mean<00:04:58.919> I<00:04:59.009> guess<00:04:59.129> you<00:04:59.159> know

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
awkward to fill I mean I guess you know

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.610 
awkward to fill I mean I guess you know
you<00:04:59.610> turn<00:04:59.939> this<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.449> you<00:05:00.810> can<00:05:00.960> kind<00:05:01.259> of<00:05:01.349> get<00:05:01.500> in

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
you turn this and you can kind of get in

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.179 
you turn this and you can kind of get in
there<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.099> if<00:05:02.460> being<00:05:02.639> at<00:05:02.819> an<00:05:02.939> angle<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:05.599> little

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
there and if being at an angle is little

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:16.839 
there and if being at an angle is little
little<00:05:08.189> weird

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.519 

you<00:05:17.419> don't<00:05:17.629> even<00:05:17.719> know<00:05:17.839> where<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.050> gas<00:05:18.169> filler

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
you don't even know where the gas filler

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.659 
you don't even know where the gas filler
is<00:05:18.649> on<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:19.449> elite<00:05:20.449> I<00:05:21.279> was<00:05:22.279> thinking<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.610> that

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
is on the elite I was thinking of that

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.579 
is on the elite I was thinking of that
oh<00:05:22.789> you<00:05:22.849> know<00:05:23.029> what<00:05:23.149> it's<00:05:23.270> right<00:05:23.360> here<00:05:23.599> there

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:24.589 
oh you know what it's right here there

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.529 
oh you know what it's right here there
it<00:05:24.709> is<00:05:24.800> so<00:05:25.339> you<00:05:25.610> know<00:05:25.759> what<00:05:25.879> that's<00:05:26.059> that's<00:05:26.419> a

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
it is so you know what that's that's a

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:27.790 
it is so you know what that's that's a
lot<00:05:26.659> more<00:05:26.779> convenient<00:05:27.139> being<00:05:27.349> straight<00:05:27.679> up

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
lot more convenient being straight up

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.389 
lot more convenient being straight up
like<00:05:27.949> that<00:05:28.129> it<00:05:28.909> does<00:05:29.089> lock<00:05:29.830> which<00:05:30.830> is<00:05:30.860> nice<00:05:31.159> so

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:31.399 
like that it does lock which is nice so

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:34.300 
like that it does lock which is nice so
does<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.639> Zuma

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.950 

so<00:05:34.850> you<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.090> guess<00:05:35.420> if<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.630> turn<00:05:35.810> the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
so you know I guess if you turn the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.200 
so you know I guess if you turn the
handlebars<00:05:36.230> yeah<00:05:36.560> it's<00:05:37.070> pretty<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.520> would<00:05:38.060> say

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
handlebars yeah it's pretty I would say

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.570 
handlebars yeah it's pretty I would say
that<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:39.050> gas<00:05:39.530> filler<00:05:39.889> is<00:05:40.040> definitely<00:05:40.490> more

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
that the gas filler is definitely more

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.700 
that the gas filler is definitely more
convenient<00:05:41.000> on<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.300> elite

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.590 

but<00:05:46.310> yeah<00:05:46.430> that's<00:05:46.580> pretty<00:05:46.820> much<00:05:46.940> it<00:05:47.270> if<00:05:47.480> you

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
but yeah that's pretty much it if you

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.000 
but yeah that's pretty much it if you
got<00:05:47.780> any<00:05:47.930> questions<00:05:48.380> or<00:05:48.650> want<00:05:48.800> anything

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
got any questions or want anything

lights<00:06:24.050> burned<00:06:24.320> out<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:24.740> whether<00:06:24.980> you're<00:06:25.130> on

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220

high<00:06:25.400> or<00:06:25.460> low<00:06:25.640> beam<00:06:25.850> because<00:06:26.090> I<00:06:26.270> think<00:06:26.510> this

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
high or low beam because I think this

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.090 
high or low beam because I think this
one<00:06:26.960> works<00:06:27.080> on<00:06:27.290> low<00:06:27.410> beam<00:06:27.590> and<00:06:27.770> this<00:06:27.830> one<00:06:27.950> works

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
one works on low beam and this one works

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.190 
one works on low beam and this one works
on<00:06:28.190> high<00:06:28.340> beam<00:06:28.520> even<00:06:29.480> though<00:06:29.570> they<00:06:29.690> both<00:06:29.900> have

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
on high beam even though they both have

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.620 
on high beam even though they both have
high-low<00:06:31.190> bulbs<00:06:31.670> which<00:06:32.090> doesn't<00:06:32.510> make<00:06:32.570> a

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
high-low bulbs which doesn't make a
