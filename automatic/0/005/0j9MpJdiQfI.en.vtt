00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
scores and I would like to talk a little

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.700 
scores and I would like to talk a little
bit<00:00:18.210> about<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.630> because<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.289> while<00:00:19.470> now

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
bit about this because it's a while now

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
bit about this because it's a while now
since<00:00:20.310> free-to-play<00:00:20.820> has<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.210> removed

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
since free-to-play has to be removed

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.880 
since free-to-play has to be removed
from<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> high<00:00:21.960> scores<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> reason<00:00:22.859> for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
from the high scores and the reason for

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
from the high scores and the reason for
that<00:00:23.010> at<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.310> time<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.480> believe<00:00:24.840> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that at that time what I believe is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.080 
that at that time what I believe is
because<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> massive<00:00:26.310> number<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> boats

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
because of the massive number of boats

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.700 
because of the massive number of boats
were<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> game<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:28.619> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
were in the game and I think that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
were in the game and I think that
announce<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.369> point<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
announce that at some point as well that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.600 
announce that at some point as well that
reason<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
reason for it is because of the well the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.010 
reason for it is because of the well the
member<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.360> more<00:00:33.570> dedicated

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
member is gonna be more dedicated

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.330 
member is gonna be more dedicated
something<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> game<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:34.950> something<00:00:35.250> like

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
something to the game or something like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.860 
something to the game or something like
that<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.910> basically<00:00:36.420> saying<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that which is basically saying that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
that which is basically saying that
there's<00:00:37.350> free<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> play<00:00:37.890> bolts<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> game

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
there's free to play bolts in the game

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.670 
there's free to play bolts in the game
which<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.270> fair<00:00:39.719> enough<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> time

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
which is fair enough because at the time

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.220 
which is fair enough because at the time
and<00:00:41.219> where<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> free<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> play<00:00:42.809> box<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and where a lot of free to play box a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.420 
and where a lot of free to play box a
thing<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.590> happened<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.070> thousand<00:00:44.399> nine

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
thing that happened in two thousand nine

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
thing that happened in two thousand nine
or<00:00:44.760> something<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.079> removed

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
or something like that that the removed

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
or something like that that the removed
every<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> play<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.610> high<00:00:47.789> score

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
every to play from the high score

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.310 
every to play from the high score
estimator<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.539> members<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> feature

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
estimator the members over a feature

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.639 
estimator the members over a feature
which<00:00:49.590> IE<00:00:50.059> at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> time<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> guess<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> did

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
which IE at the time I guess I was I did

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.260 
which IE at the time I guess I was I did
I<00:00:52.739> never<00:00:52.920> agreed<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
I never agreed with it like I think the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.580 
I never agreed with it like I think the
free<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> collect<00:00:54.780> should<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.079> their<00:00:55.320> spot

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
free to collect should have their spot

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.099 
free to collect should have their spot
on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> high<00:00:55.980> scores<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.879> understood<00:00:57.480> why

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
on the high scores but I understood why

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.229 
on the high scores but I understood why
they<00:00:58.289> did<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.500> another<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
they did it another thing with this that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
they did it another thing with this that
makes<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.690> poll<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.109> special<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.739> on

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
makes this poll so special is that on

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.500 
makes this poll so special is that on
the<00:01:02.070> forms<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> moment<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.090> actually

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the forms at the moment you can actually

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
the forms at the moment you can actually

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
community at home what you think kind of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
community at home what you think kind of
what<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.220> voted<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.540> able<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what you voted for and be able to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
what you voted for and be able to
discuss<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.189> pass<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
discuss it and they will pass on this

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
discuss it and they will pass on this
information<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.780> whoever's<00:01:13.530> interested<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
information to whoever's interested in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.499 
information to whoever's interested in
and<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:14.729> something<00:01:14.880> special<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and I think that's something special in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.850 
and I think that's something special in
that<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.140> probably<00:01:16.380> means<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that because it probably means that

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
that because it probably means that
you're<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> looking<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you're kind of looking into this at the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
you're kind of looking into this at the
moment<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> community<00:01:19.560> wants<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
moment to see what the community wants a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.410 
moment to see what the community wants a

developers whoever is going to be I kind
of<00:01:26.759> behind<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.439> it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of behind all this which I think it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.840 
of behind all this which I think it's
really<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.979> thing<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> look<00:01:29.700> if

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really good thing and I kind of look if

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.340 
really good thing and I kind of look if
that<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> golden<00:01:30.479> chance<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that is a golden chance to get kind of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
that is a golden chance to get kind of
forward<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.770> information<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
forward your information than what you

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.399 
forward your information than what you
think<00:01:33.210> should<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.420> added<00:01:33.450> onto<00:01:33.840> high<00:01:34.079> scores

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
think should be added onto high scores

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
think should be added onto high scores
and<00:01:34.619> personally<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> voted<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.970> seasonal

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and personally I voted for it seasonal

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
and personally I voted for it seasonal
high<00:01:36.479> school<00:01:36.750> changes<00:01:37.110> before<00:01:37.320> skills<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
high school changes before skills and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.710 
high school changes before skills and
search<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.850> that's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
search because I think that that's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.880 
search because I think that that's
something<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:40.170> should<00:01:40.320> focus<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.680> on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
something they should focus more on

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.109 
something they should focus more on
since<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> promise

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
since it was kind of about the promise

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
since it was kind of about the promise
with<00:01:42.270> runescape<00:01:42.689> 3<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.770> fully

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
with runescape 3 but I can fully

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
with runescape 3 but I can fully
understand<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:45.030> people<00:01:45.240> want<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
understand what people want for you to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
understand what people want for you to
play<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> high<00:01:46.649> scores<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
play on the high scores and I want that

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
play on the high scores and I want that
too<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> moment<00:01:48.829> free-to-play

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
too because at the moment free-to-play

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.440 
too because at the moment free-to-play
don't<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> community<00:01:51.149> some

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
don't actually have a community some

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.789 
don't actually have a community some
people<00:01:51.750> found<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> confusing<00:01:52.710> but

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
people found that kind of confusing but

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.499 
people found that kind of confusing but
actually<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.479> should

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
actually do and I think that they should

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
actually do and I think that they should
get<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> same<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.460> equality

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
get a kind of the same kind of equality

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
get a kind of the same kind of equality
as<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> high<00:01:58.409> scores

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
as we do when you get to the high scores

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
as we do when you get to the high scores
and<00:01:58.950> also<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.520> for<00:02:00.180> players<00:02:00.600> who<00:02:00.630> are

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and also think that for players who are

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.910 
and also think that for players who are
kind<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.990> new<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.350> game<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> figure

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
kind of new to the game I want to figure

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
kind of new to the game I want to figure
out<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.280> who's<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> best<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
out like who's actually the best in this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.490 
out like who's actually the best in this
game<00:02:03.509> or<00:02:03.780> whatever<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.380> high

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
game or whatever they go into high

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
game or whatever they go into high
scores<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.790> there's<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
scores and to see that there's like I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.910 
scores and to see that there's like I
don't<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.600> four<00:02:07.290> hundred<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.649> ninety

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
don't know four hundred and ninety

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.249 
don't know four hundred and ninety
thousand<00:02:08.280> people<00:02:08.810> that's<00:02:09.810> ranking<00:02:10.140> high

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
thousand people that's ranking high

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
thousand people that's ranking high
scores<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.830> doesn't<00:02:11.099> really<00:02:11.190> look<00:02:11.400> very

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
scores and that doesn't really look very

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.990 
scores and that doesn't really look very
good

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
good

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.300 
good
for<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> Prairie<00:02:13.380> basin<00:02:13.830> whatever's<00:02:14.190> I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
for like the Prairie basin whatever's I

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.230 
for like the Prairie basin whatever's I
think<00:02:14.550> they<00:02:14.610> should<00:02:14.760> definitely<00:02:15.120> add<00:02:15.210> some

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
think they should definitely add some

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.110 
think they should definitely add some
free<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> play<00:02:16.260> players<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.460> my<00:02:17.850> own

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
free to play players in there and my own

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.090 
free to play players in there and my own
suggestion<00:02:18.570> here<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.290> kind<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.620> will

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
suggestion here is that it kind of will

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.040 
suggestion here is that it kind of will
be<00:02:20.220> able<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.580> totally<00:02:20.940> Dustin<00:02:21.570> if<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.780> just

be able to do that if you only see one
bit<00:02:31.230> well<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.980> only<00:02:32.130> want<00:02:32.280> some<00:02:32.490> members

bit well if you only want some members

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
bit well if you only want some members
you<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.360> do<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:33.810> which<00:02:34.140> i<00:02:34.290> think<00:02:34.350> is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
you can do that as well which i think is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.230 
you can do that as well which i think is
a<00:02:34.740> really<00:02:34.890> good<00:02:35.070> solution<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.820> because<00:02:35.970> in

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
a really good solution for it because in

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.060 
a really good solution for it because in
that<00:02:36.330> way<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.990> different<00:02:37.380> communities<00:02:37.530> will

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
that way the different communities will

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.040 
that way the different communities will
be<00:02:38.130> able<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.550> see<00:02:38.760> who's<00:02:39.270> actually<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.870> best

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
be able to see who's actually the best

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.960 
be able to see who's actually the best
player<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.070> overall<00:02:41.400> stormy

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
player like you can see overall stormy

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.180 
player like you can see overall stormy
member<00:02:42.660> states<00:02:42.870> remain<00:02:43.110> free<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.530> play<00:02:43.620> it's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
member states remain free to play it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.620 
member states remain free to play it's
not<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.880> brought<00:02:45.030> someone<00:02:45.300> else<00:02:45.510> you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
not so it's brought someone else you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.790 
not so it's brought someone else you
know<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.110> that's<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.590> good

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
know and I think that's a really good

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.250 
know and I think that's a really good
way<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> do<00:02:47.910> things<00:02:48.120> obviously<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.870> show<00:02:49.080> me

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
way to do things obviously if show me

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.229 
way to do things obviously if show me
what<00:02:49.410> free<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> play<00:02:49.830> he<00:02:50.400> would<00:02:50.580> be<00:02:50.730> ranked<00:02:51.030> one

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
what free to play he would be ranked one

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.670 
what free to play he would be ranked one
a<00:02:51.390> free<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> play<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:51.900> something<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.470> or

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
a free to play or something like that or

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.320 
a free to play or something like that or
they<00:02:52.920> could<00:02:53.070> simply<00:02:53.370> counted<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.850> four

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
they could simply counted in four

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.240 
they could simply counted in four
players<00:02:54.570> who<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:54.989> voted<00:02:55.500> what<00:02:56.040> kind<00:02:56.220> of

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
players who are voted what kind of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.790 
players who are voted what kind of
ranked<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.090> member<00:02:57.540> scale<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.050> obviously

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
ranked in a member scale and obviously

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.430 
ranked in a member scale and obviously
the<00:02:59.040> thing<00:02:59.250> with<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.870> even<00:03:00.870> though

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the thing with this is that even though

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.060 
the thing with this is that even though
there<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:02.900> very<00:03:03.900> few<00:03:03.989> boats<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.770> game<00:03:04.950> at

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
there are very few boats in the game at

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.770 
there are very few boats in the game at
the<00:03:05.100> moment<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.520> are<00:03:05.670> still<00:03:06.120> some<00:03:06.390> people

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the moment there are still some people

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.090 
the moment there are still some people
that<00:03:06.900> might<00:03:06.959> be<00:03:07.320> kind<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.560> don't<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.920> like

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
that might be kind of don't you like

gosh bad side spammers pretty much it's
still<00:03:12.630> running<00:03:12.840> rather<00:03:13.110> than<00:03:13.260> doing<00:03:13.470> their

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
bad thing and everything and though

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.990 
bad thing and everything and though
would<00:03:15.650> technically<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.769> ranked<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.880> high

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
would technically be ranked on the high

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.729 
would technically be ranked on the high
scores<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:18.570> if<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.780> kind<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.140> bring<00:03:19.320> back<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
scores but if you kind of bring back the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.410 
scores but if you kind of bring back the
old<00:03:19.769> kind<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.190> thing<00:03:20.340> with<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:21.180> two

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
old kind of thing with that the two

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.850 
old kind of thing with that the two
million<00:03:22.230> most<00:03:23.030> against<00:03:24.030> active<00:03:24.390> people<00:03:24.860> what

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
million most against active people what

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.710 
million most against active people what
kind<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.220> two<00:03:26.370> million<00:03:26.700> most<00:03:26.940> well<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
kind of the two million most well the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.180 
kind of the two million most well the
best<00:03:27.930> people<00:03:28.140> basically<00:03:28.440> are<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> highest

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
best people basically are on the highest

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.170 
best people basically are on the highest
scores<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.489> think<00:03:29.670> that's<00:03:29.850> something<00:03:30.000> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
scores I think that's something that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
scores I think that's something that
should<00:03:30.299> continue<00:03:30.810> doing<00:03:31.140> because<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.860> means

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
should continue doing because it means

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.710 
should continue doing because it means
you<00:03:32.160> need<00:03:32.280> at<00:03:32.459> least<00:03:32.489> level<00:03:32.910> 30<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.360> be<00:03:33.480> ranked

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you need at least level 30 to be ranked

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.810 
you need at least level 30 to be ranked
in<00:03:33.780> high<00:03:33.959> scores<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:34.920> get<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.340> is

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
in high scores and if you get that is

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.970 
in high scores and if you get that is
only<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> two<00:03:36.450> million<00:03:37.140> best<00:03:37.380> people<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
only the two million best people in the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.949 
only the two million best people in the
game<00:03:38.160> where<00:03:38.670> she<00:03:38.790> gets<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.090> space<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.750> spot

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
game where she gets a space on the spot

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.110 
game where she gets a space on the spot
which<00:03:40.200> i<00:03:40.320> think<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.799> something<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.940> could

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
which i think is something that could

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.970 
which i think is something that could
possibly<00:03:42.480> do<00:03:42.720> well<00:03:43.200> continue<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.860> least

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
possibly do well continue with at least

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.069 
possibly do well continue with at least
I<00:03:44.130> don't<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:44.459> see<00:03:44.610> why<00:03:44.730> they<00:03:45.180> don't<00:03:45.600> do<00:03:45.930> it

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
I don't really see why they don't do it

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.110 
I don't really see why they don't do it
because<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.680> moment<00:03:46.709> as<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.160> said<00:03:47.549> through

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
because at the moment as I said through

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.090 
because at the moment as I said through
our<00:03:48.209> robots<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.290> what's<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> issue<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.860> know

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
our robots so what's the issue you know

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.770 
our robots so what's the issue you know
that<00:03:50.280> was<00:03:50.430> issued<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.880> long<00:03:51.090> time<00:03:51.390> ago<00:03:51.540> they

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
that was issued a long time ago they

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.690 
that was issued a long time ago they
said<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.079> would<00:03:52.170> bring<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.500> back<00:03:52.680> if<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.549> bus

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
said it would bring it back if the bus

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.460 
said it would bring it back if the bus
were<00:03:53.880> disappearing<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.600> that's<00:03:54.870> what's<00:03:55.200> been

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
were disappearing and that's what's been

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.620 
were disappearing and that's what's been
going<00:03:55.769> on<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.489> why<00:03:56.670> not<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.120> know<00:03:57.150> that's<00:03:57.450> kind

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
going on so why not you know that's kind

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.880 
going on so why not you know that's kind
of<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:57.870> what<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.049> think<00:03:58.380> let<00:03:58.560> me<00:03:58.590> know<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
of just what I think let me know in the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.350 
of just what I think let me know in the
comment<00:03:59.250> section<00:03:59.489> below<00:03:59.549> or<00:03:59.850> do<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.299> think

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
comment section below or do you think

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.789 
comment section below or do you think
it's<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.780> free<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.049> put<00:04:01.170> high<00:04:01.290> scores<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.739> be

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
it's a free to put high scores to be
