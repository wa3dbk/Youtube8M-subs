00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
this one's pretty easy basically you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
this one's pretty easy basically you
just<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.220> back<00:01:05.460> spin<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.150> all

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
just do your back spin and then all

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
just do your back spin and then all
you're<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.439> stick<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.040> foot

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you're going to do is stick your foot

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
you're going to do is stick your foot
out<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.630> hits<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.960> foot<00:01:10.229> you're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
out and as it hits your foot you're

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.730 
out and as it hits your foot you're
going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> hit<00:01:11.010> pick<00:01:12.000> your<00:01:12.180> foot<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.740> then

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
going to hit pick your foot up and then

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.210 
going to hit pick your foot up and then
you're<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> catch<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:18.979> normally<00:01:19.979> use

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you're going to catch it I normally use

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.200 
you're going to catch it I normally use
like<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.880> big<00:01:21.119> toe<00:01:22.130> typically<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.490> pretty

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
like my big toe typically that's pretty

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.890 
like my big toe typically that's pretty
much<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.780> i<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:26.700> don't<00:01:27.150> hit<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.509> big<00:01:27.689> toe

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
much what i use it don't hit my big toe

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.390 
much what i use it don't hit my big toe
you<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.560> need<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> whole<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you really don't need a whole lot of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.910 
you really don't need a whole lot of
force<00:01:29.640> behind<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.380> grab<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> with

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
force behind it you can grab it with

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.179 
force behind it you can grab it with
either<00:01:38.130> hand<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.299> one's<00:01:39.450> pretty<00:01:39.659> simple

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
either hand but that one's pretty simple

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.410 
either hand but that one's pretty simple
so<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> next<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.850> i'm<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> show

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so the next one that i'm going to show

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.800 
so the next one that i'm going to show
you<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:43.430> an<00:01:44.430> isolating<00:01:45.180> trick<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you is an isolating trick so if you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.319 
you is an isolating trick so if you
don't<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.170> how<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> isolate<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.670> probably

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
don't know how to isolate you probably

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.160 
don't know how to isolate you probably
won't<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.750> able<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> basically

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
won't be able to do this so so basically

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.760 
won't be able to do this so so basically
what<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:57.649> you're<00:01:58.649> going

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.430> spin<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.899> once<00:02:03.899> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to do your back spin and once it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
to do your back spin and once it's
coming<00:02:04.409> back<00:02:04.590> towards<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
coming back towards you you're going to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.010 
coming back towards you you're going to
grab<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.689> right<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:11.039> three<00:02:11.849> o'clock

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
grab it right at the like three o'clock

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.960 
grab it right at the like three o'clock
because<00:02:13.590> where<00:02:13.980> would<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.520> right<00:02:14.760> down

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
because where would be like right down

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.390 
because where would be like right down
here<00:02:15.240> three<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.110> four<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:17.100> going<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
here three to four and you're going to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.470 
here three to four and you're going to
start<00:02:17.820> your<00:02:18.090> isolation<00:02:18.740> OOP<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:21.000> isolation

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
start your isolation OOP your isolation

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
start your isolation OOP your isolation
and<00:02:22.640> then<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:24.060> bring<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.450> straight<00:02:24.750> up<00:02:25.580> so

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then you can bring it straight up so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:37.580 
and then you can bring it straight up so
one<00:02:27.360> more<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:35.900> another<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.410> can

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
one more time another thing that you can

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.670 
one more time another thing that you can
do<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.280> your<00:02:38.310> back<00:02:38.760> Spence<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.600> kind<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.650> just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
do with your back Spence is kind of just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.480 
do with your back Spence is kind of just
getting<00:02:41.160> more<00:02:41.520> creative<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:43.490> interacting

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
getting more creative with interacting

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.980 
getting more creative with interacting
with<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.400> people<00:02:47.790> watching<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.360> so

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
with the with the people watching you so

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.010 
with the with the people watching you so
a<00:02:49.380> lot<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.680> times<00:02:49.980> I'll<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:51.120> really<00:02:51.540> goofy

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
a lot of times I'll just be really goofy

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.850 
a lot of times I'll just be really goofy
and<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.670> back<00:02:54.060> spin<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.720> then<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.380> kind<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
and I do a back spin and then I kind of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.430 
and I do a back spin and then I kind of
have<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.040> come<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.730> me<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.150> guess<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> sense<00:03:01.790> um

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
have it come to me I guess in a sense um
