 in previous episodes 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.060
 as much to say it 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.729
 he has internet wikileaks 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.909
 and the militia month is at the heart of the electronic art campus according to the studio 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.209

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:48.790
 inert body and alice 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.920
 the inexperience world be a woman this uprising 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.650
 it's super funny me I did my job 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.170
 robert gates 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.060
 to his last home 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.660
 all at once 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.180
 and for this penultimate episode we are going to discover 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.910
 of an extraordinary world both of you each of you community 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.759
 above an international community and you will see it very active 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.690
 that's what we're sorry about that I know 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.570
 21 am in the church for the tram all the amenities draws it is very 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.120
 different I do not know how many people are selling on the internet 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.180
 but it is an environment sometimes a little hostile and sometimes be a little 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.200
 aggressive when neither give a taste to the scene and as for this info 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.690
 meanwhile the pool there are many communities rather 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.850
 negative but the cognacais decimated and refreshing because positive its purpose 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.230
 being to share his own creations and commented by michÃ¨le 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.290
 blacket notice the others 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.760
 30 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.600
 we are still in Carcassonne to help once who knows how 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.410
 some artists all the communities the artist are rather 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.660
 healthy because everyone knows something else we watched the creation 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.880
 of someone you also want to create something you have 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 this cycle of creativity that makes everyone contemporary because they 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 appreciate the process in place 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 to go 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.130
 in addition m 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.130
 I like You 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.279
 a woman 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.599
 more people 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.430
 more people stay for now 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.379
 only one month 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.270
 admirable mm 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.030
 the authors the community always tells us what they want them 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.130
 other work two teams remaining I think we have it is rather 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.460
 well done in recent years the funding that comes this 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.389
 new potential brought by a world 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.829
 yesterday we will have to handle all the requests that will happen there is 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.159
 no comments yet for this dispatch but m 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.609
 anna hazare was arrested a month later and 16 parties to the thesis 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.290
 who will have forgotten all male and female users around the world 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.189
 so I imagine that for someone who directs to a new nail see 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.459
 access to these communities is pretty awesome but it is hoped that 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.629
 paquette 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.569
 an open beta test is right to think that these are very people 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.340
 creative and very kind with a whole group a mirror and toulouse he drops 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.629
 complaint anyway huh I think that's why this community and 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.780
 so open to go because it was built around a video games tool 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:24.580
 winning 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.860
 seriously we talk more m that's the thing we did that is based 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.499
 around creativity 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.839
 I think that's what brings people who come to be tolerant 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.059
 exploits through the ages and the media are not interested in 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.229
 comfortable with myself and thanks to his head the last year 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:41.919
 and for good reason 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.319
 that's why anyway regardless of their magenta gender all those who 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.459
 sim tried what weighs so much these are very creative people each 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.909
 step akram is well honed had confessed or to a species came with his site 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.889
 tenderness 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.799
 it's the same 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.139
 and you have to be imputed to israel 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.569
 his scene his crews 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.219
 maybe some experience I hope our fans have a lot 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.319
 to influence the content and the changes we made 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.310
 maybe 80 to 90% 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.800
 because we receive there is nothing left of the reunion to raise the one who has 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:22.759
 been done 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.400
 an amount that is wrong what is the importance of the bd and mansaly us 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.169
 want it's a it would be nice to have someone last and the players 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.969
 do not hesitate to express themselves the investigators discover they want 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.669
 talk about something the story rather like that explained the 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.059
 French winner 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:42.469
 three retirees argas it seemed to me very comfortable the few to stay and 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.059
 that it is rich that some of our players also use the microphone 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:49.159
 integrated the most creative that ends up cinema the touchpad to a rather small 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.079
 sophisticated but I love going on youtube we had more than 200 

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:56.459
 millions of downloads for his films as well signed dj star of my uncle 

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:00.449
 incredible that some players tells some movies only circulate people 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.999
 of the community but a few are powered on youtube where there is a 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.339
 wider audience the range of stories and pass and not send you 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.799
 April 15 and 16 do not know what is after the patrons
