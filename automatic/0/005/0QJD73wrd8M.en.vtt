that and you're going to need a zip
compression<00:00:36.890> file<00:00:37.890> application<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.730> well

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
compression file application as well

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.869 
compression file application as well
that<00:00:39.090> expresses<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.489> maybe<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.730> could

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that expresses it and maybe you could

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.260 
that expresses it and maybe you could
use<00:00:42.090> swiss<00:00:42.600> knife<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.079> format<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.280> big<00:00:45.059> hard

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
use swiss knife to format and I big hard

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
use swiss knife to format and I big hard
types<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> stuff<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> use

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
types and stuff but it's going to use

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
types and stuff but it's going to use
the<00:00:46.620> Windows<00:00:46.920> application<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.579> formatting

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

the Windows application for formatting
flash<00:00:48.180> drives<00:00:48.420> okay<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.440> basically<00:00:50.010> we're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
flash drives okay so basically we're

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
flash drives okay so basically we're
going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.640> first<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.270> we're<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> go

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
to removable flash disk and then we're

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.399 
to removable flash disk and then we're
going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.109> back<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:59.030> my<00:01:00.030> computer<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:03.409> then

going to go back to my computer and then
I<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> disk<00:01:06.860> right<00:01:07.860> click<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:11.970> to
