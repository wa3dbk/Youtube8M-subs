00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.569 
would negate it it doesn't like destroy
is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> problem<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.159> negates<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
is the problem because it negates the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.280 
is the problem because it negates the
activation<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.900> good<00:01:34.049> but

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
activation which is kind of good but

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
activation which is kind of good but
again<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.799> problem<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> card<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.150> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
again the problem with the card is that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
again the problem with the card is that
it<00:01:36.420> does<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.409> destroy<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> card<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it does not actually destroy the card so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
it does not actually destroy the card so
it<00:01:38.759> goes<00:01:38.909> back<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> owner's<00:01:39.479> hand<00:01:39.630> they

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it goes back to the owner's hand they

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.420 
it goes back to the owner's hand they
just<00:01:40.290> reactivate<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.280> than<00:01:41.369> likely

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
just reactivate it more than likely

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450 
just reactivate it more than likely
anyways<00:01:42.030> next<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.680> card<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> I
