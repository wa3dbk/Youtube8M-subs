the house a couple of examples include a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.790 
the house a couple of examples include a
shift<00:04:01.340> from<00:04:01.730> high-contrast<00:04:02.630> colors<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.770> a

much<00:04:04.130> more<00:04:04.400> monochromatic<00:04:04.880> palette<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.380> for

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
much more monochromatic palette so for

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.430 
much more monochromatic palette so for
example<00:04:07.030> instead<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.239> painting<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.050> shutters

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440

and<00:04:09.470> doors<00:04:10.190> black<00:04:11.000> or<00:04:11.360> red<00:04:11.959> potentially<00:04:12.950> try

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
and doors black or red potentially try

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.820 
and doors black or red potentially try
something<00:04:14.120> like<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.330> soft<00:04:14.720> vanilla<00:04:15.140> or<00:04:15.470> maybe

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
something like a soft vanilla or maybe

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.770 
something like a soft vanilla or maybe
even<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.579> gray

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.160 

so<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.860> 2012<00:04:26.520> give<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.000> try<00:04:27.210> try<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> much<00:04:27.960> more

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
so in 2012 give it a try try a much more

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.590 
so in 2012 give it a try try a much more
