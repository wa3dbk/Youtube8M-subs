00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and some tuna and so it could probably

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
and some tuna and so it could probably
use<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> little<00:00:31.740> freon<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> air

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's got tons of power again could use a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.180

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
you can see over here controls for your

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.860 
you can see over here controls for your
power<00:01:37.740> windows<00:01:38.280> locks<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.790> mirrors<00:01:38.910> now<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
power windows locks and mirrors now the

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.660 
power windows locks and mirrors now the
power<00:01:40.200> locks<00:01:40.470> quit<00:01:40.710> working<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.250> day<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.460> think

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
power locks quit working one day I think

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
power locks quit working one day I think
there<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.480> like<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.750> puff<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.200> smoke

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
there was like a little puff of smoke

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
there was like a little puff of smoke
possibly<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> fuse<00:01:44.640> blew<00:01:44.910> out<00:01:45.090> something<00:01:45.570> like

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
possibly a fuse blew out something like

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:55.350 
possibly a fuse blew out something like
that<00:01:49.250> okay<00:01:50.250> taking<00:01:50.550> off<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:50.940> more<00:01:51.150> time

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.270 

runs<00:01:55.990> great<00:01:56.200> now<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.530> got<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.890> have<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.040> real

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
runs great now you got to have a real

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.100 
runs great now you got to have a real
light<00:01:57.520> touch<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.210> accelerator<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:58.990> got

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
light touch on the accelerator it's got

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.960 
light touch on the accelerator it's got
a<00:01:59.140> carburetor<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.010> could<00:02:00.190> use<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.400> tune-up<00:02:00.610> but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
a carburetor and could use a tune-up but

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.270 
a carburetor and could use a tune-up but
with<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.210> light<00:02:01.390> touch<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.930> really<00:02:02.290> takes<00:02:03.070> off

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
with the light touch it really takes off

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.660 
with the light touch it really takes off
and<00:02:03.550> run<00:02:04.210> smooth<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:05.920> got<00:02:06.070> somebody<00:02:06.280> going

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and run smooth here I got somebody going

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.160 
and run smooth here I got somebody going
the<00:02:06.730> wrong<00:02:06.880> way<00:02:08.880> now<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.420> heat<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.750> air<00:02:10.899> work

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the wrong way now the heat and air work

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.750 
the wrong way now the heat and air work
intermittently<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.130> think<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.460> probably

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
intermittently and I think it's probably

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.460 
intermittently and I think it's probably
just<00:02:12.940> some<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.270> those<00:02:13.630> little<00:02:13.810> vacuum<00:02:14.260> lines

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
just some of those little vacuum lines

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.220 
just some of those little vacuum lines
