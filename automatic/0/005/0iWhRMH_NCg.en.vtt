00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
this phenomenon through reading books I

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.729 
this phenomenon through reading books I
came<00:03:19.400> across<00:03:19.519> Gabe<00:03:19.940> Valdez<00:03:20.420> name<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.959> came<00:03:21.590> out

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
came across Gabe Valdez name I came out

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.770 
came across Gabe Valdez name I came out
and<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.950> met<00:03:22.190> him<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.640> we<00:03:22.700> hit<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.690> off

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
and I met him and we hit it off

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.940 
and I met him and we hit it off
instantly<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.980> had<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:26.140> common<00:03:27.140> interest<00:03:27.680> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
instantly we had a a common interest and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.250 
instantly we had a a common interest and
not<00:03:28.430> only<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:28.790> was<00:03:28.940> UFOs<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.900> cattle

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
not only it was UFOs and cattle

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.690 
not only it was UFOs and cattle
mutilations<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:30.890> whatnot

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
mutilations and whatnot

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.880 
mutilations and whatnot
to<00:03:31.970> find<00:03:32.239> out<00:03:32.390> why<00:03:32.660> there<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.320> much<00:03:33.470> cancer

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
to find out why there is so much cancer

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.890 
to find out why there is so much cancer
in<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.130> area<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.510> thought<00:03:38.690> that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
in this area and we we thought that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.600 
in this area and we we thought that
maybe<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.200> was<00:03:39.320> because<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.950> gas<00:03:40.160> buggy

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
maybe it was because of the gas buggy

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.900 
maybe it was because of the gas buggy
that<00:03:41.269> was<00:03:41.510> nearby<00:03:41.810> here<00:03:42.290> they<00:03:42.470> exploded<00:03:43.130> years

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
that was nearby here they exploded years

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.660 
that was nearby here they exploded years
ago<00:03:44.150> exploded<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.780> nuclear<00:03:44.810> device<00:03:45.739> 4000<00:03:46.519> feet

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
ago exploded a nuclear device 4000 feet

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.820 
ago exploded a nuclear device 4000 feet
below<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.000> ground<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.989> UFOs<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.709> this

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
below the ground and the UFOs and this

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.920 
below the ground and the UFOs and this
is<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.070> hot<00:03:49.220> spot<00:03:49.400> for<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:49.880> all<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.209> that's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
is the hot spot for it all and that's

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.630 
is the hot spot for it all and that's
how<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.140> found<00:03:51.410> out<00:03:51.709> about<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.100> basically

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
how I found out about it basically

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.229
