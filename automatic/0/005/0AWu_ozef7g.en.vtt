00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.220
 imagined if there had been a football storm 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 h exists but what he plays a the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 match ammann street lightning storm 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.510
 d'anjou not at all the guy shaman no 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.099
 but not at all low there are guys in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.450
 Junior amount but not because it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.889
 take them crack the earth nabobs 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.260
 we go over and the corn power 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 was classified address and pragmatic 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 then it's almost end it's hot 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.750
 to go until finally there he goes 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.420
 ask to pilot of shredder he treats 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.490
 on a theme and it really gets 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 problematic 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.199
 he will lose a spider to kill 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 door secret behind it a spider 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 european crash finally it's this problem 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.660
 and that's it they are all 0 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.860
 creatures to take over the board the sq 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.300
 he's fine with me I'll think 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.410
 eventually the wolves showed he 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 need a big presence something 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 with a body that will be able to make a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 taste of trade at least for for the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.590
 give back to tempo but long term and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.969
 that's actually a problem it makes me 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.620
 a little think actually shaman makes me a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.760
 little think paladin ie you 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 have very good cards but you do not have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.730
 no presence on the bench you do not have 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.320
 of real threat was threat happens too 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.760
 far from being forced to look for threats 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.770
 in the cards our hall is actually 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.270
 that's what brought the guy shaman 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.430
 to say that look look at the hand of 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.830
 guiglo at last he does not want anything 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.060
 to see the hand of xu on the table is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.479
 by cons they would not see 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.960
 repopulate to no more because that's it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 you 're horeb may and hoping that the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.310
 new cards that happens is going right 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 as you spoke the elementary what 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 happens and the dragons in not there 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.340
 who will bring this threat to this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.340
 kind of easter 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.840
 so here I think you do not know me 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.090
 cracks her totem and I put there 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.490
 the guy at 3 way the collar is okay there I 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.289
 think speed up your way to crack up the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.740
 web like that actually 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.490
 if tutu not the theme yeah you take the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.250
 risk of having a totem tautou ton after 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.689
 a bit annoying booster you see and that there 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.039
 you kill the totem of course to reduce 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.539
 the chances of having the totem that he has 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.329
 want if ever there is a web storm 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.840
 thing by taking up a good theme 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.840
 puglia 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.679
 ok so he's going to come handle this spider 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.299
 and crash crash vases have clearly 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.399
 the tourist has in these situations there who 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.739
 there's no cards in hand 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.709
 I am not convinced by tourism 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.470
 in this kind of up and down shaman 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.200
 it is the peculiarity of the aqsiq shaman 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.760
 zoo illange two and it has him all 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.930
 just given the range yesterday and that 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480
 risk of giving him the range here too 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.390
 to manon and garlic I think it's going to be 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.069
 obliged to arrive in turn history rings 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 mail of 3.10 onoma absolutely nothing to 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.660
 fuck but has it in the end does that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.040
 puts it so well that it bah yes because 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.239
 that behind in more he chained on gold 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.600
 so you can not run both 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.940
 weeks 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.230
 finally I think it really made the 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.030
 pastilla horeb the pass that would have after 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.530
 he can send have not even because 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.319
 that he type how much he puts three he is to 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.489
 5 crocs rock on their hip hop it's 4 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.489
 which means you do not love me there 8.8 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.180
 the crate that will require a ground element 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.319
 of fire which card at alex could 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.470
 allow him to go back in this 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.849
 part of the annex or not - 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.769
 elementary hair I think he has 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.239
 three breizh out because the study does 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.129
 let's not forget is a 7.7 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.299
 work is effective on the a88 and 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.250
 behind that really gives him what 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.940
 return four active cards his 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.019
 potential in synergy that the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.030
 neptune so have this solution 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.560
 part knowing that he so you have us 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.140
 spoke 3 out of 20 cards 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.189
 yeah that we know to think because they 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.239
 play of choice there can be the 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.269
 worth wandering in or 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.920
 other but and proba are not on the side 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:35.730
 of alÃ¨s in any case not at all then there 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.319
 so there's what makes it m 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.450
 mecha teleporter or the theme restaurant 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.190
 maybe just aurep totem 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.349
 that's it but it's going on that it's me 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.599
 not bad and more on totem of 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.430
 tons you have hard enough it's 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:54.359
 dramatic we left on a line on 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:57.780
 the a85 and here at the argus very good 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.239
 bros voice that will allow him to 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.169
 look for this totem with his 2,3 and go 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.730
 do the trade with his roof san and he 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.799
 let's go there is this rampage hour there 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.669
 no ricela the argus gives huawei 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:14.129
 the argus really saved allechi 6 or at 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:18.209
 see again tories san hellemmes de foot en 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.530
 tourist but he does and you see 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.970
 compare a match but case I find that 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.580
 it is a force that fights 6 and 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.460
 hellemmes of fire which is a power 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.180
 who does not necessarily have the match but that at 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.470
 this moment of the game 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.139
 but these images but want m 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.160
 fire their name the mage dude I compare to 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.050
 shamans guy both ok yes ok 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.570
 the in the mecha scheme is still there 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.009
 the same fire it depends on that already 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.289
 usually he does not even have the 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.909
 the a88 there so it really depends on 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.050
 lists of each but I find that 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.969
 the blades of fire so that's the map 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.430
 this is the first card to put in 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.509
 chammam epsilon habana but the worst 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.879
 it is that technip tulon he gives you 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.740
 four active cards haart the end no 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.300
 but here I go two shots of the grindstone 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.680
 she can leave very quickly what turn 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.119
 after and there he can do a tour of 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.819
 sick he can already do me I 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.249
 will leave on then totem waits there 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.349
 twelve cards in time because there he 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.020
 have to count 1 there you know that if draws 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.969
 a wall loca 1,2 die north do you do 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.529
 do neptuno a merlot case I do 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.919
 neptuno I look what you euros 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.710
 after you make fangs and after all the evil 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.759
 and here but the damage is still the 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.870
 case a memory of 1 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.919
 he'll put the eighth on the a83 live id 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.080
 the mourning of his advancement 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.180
 it's better to have a thunderstorm 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.919
 because on a misunderstanding actually on 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.789
 their age you can have 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:43.319
 you can you are 8 3 so you crackle 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.089
 first on totem 02 totems and after 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.680
 you make storms you can not tap the 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.319
 trunk 1 6 1 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.419
 orelsan dropped to william thoury sant 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.009
 and farting tourist then nothing 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.370
 and now you forum he is planning the 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.819
 wins to be to get wet here 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.620
 but in addition that you really a88 bola 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.169
 the move what just happened on that 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.899
 there is organized Mulloul and 5th at 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:10.909
 it was so beautiful and that's 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.909
 magnificent club of new techno
