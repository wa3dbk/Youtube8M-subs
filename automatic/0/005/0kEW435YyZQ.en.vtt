team and we worked really hard and it

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.859 
team and we worked really hard and it
was<00:00:23.130> hard<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.490> play<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.300> pitcher<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.689> not

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
was hard to play the pitcher was not

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
was hard to play the pitcher was not
really<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.140> good<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:26.099> managed<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
really that good but we managed to get a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
really that good but we managed to get a
draw<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> end<00:00:27.630> yeah<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.740> really

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
draw in the end yeah it was really

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.099 
draw in the end yeah it was really
difficult<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.480> kind<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> game<00:00:30.990> we

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
difficult that was the kind of game we

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
difficult that was the kind of game we
was<00:00:31.260> expecting<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.390> will

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
was expecting but but I think we will

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
was expecting but but I think we will
control<00:00:33.930> our<00:00:33.989> nerves<00:00:34.350> even<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> last<00:00:35.160> five

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
control our nerves even if the last five

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.600 
control our nerves even if the last five
minutes<00:00:35.760> he<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:35.850> quite<00:00:36.090> intense<00:00:36.590> but<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.489> we

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
minutes he was quite intense but but we

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.840 
minutes he was quite intense but but we
did<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.120> had<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.629> game<00:00:39.989> plan<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.469> came<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> we

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
did it we had a game plan we came and we

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.720 
did it we had a game plan we came and we
played<00:00:42.149> try<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> win<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> game<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
played try to win the game and in the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
played try to win the game and in the
end<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.200> we<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.350> deserve<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
end I think we really deserve to go to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
end I think we really deserve to go to
the<00:00:47.219> next<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:48.469> because<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.950> we

who manage it so we go through this kind

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
who manage it so we go through this kind
of<00:01:31.110> games<00:01:31.350> even<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> better<00:01:32.790> team

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
of games even if we was a better team

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
of games even if we was a better team
but<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.509> football<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.930> never<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.500> had

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
but in football you never know they had

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.420 
but in football you never know they had
some<00:01:35.119> really<00:01:36.119> good<00:01:36.329> white<00:01:36.570> free-kick<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.430> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
some really good white free-kick and the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.399 
some really good white free-kick and the
devil<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.880> delivery<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.509> quite<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
devil is a delivery was quite good so

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.920 
devil is a delivery was quite good so
anything<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.220> happen<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> think<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
anything can happen but I think that the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.740 
anything can happen but I think that the
boys<00:01:43.110> even<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:44.880> nervous<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:45.570> bit

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
boys even there was nervous a little bit

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.450 
boys even there was nervous a little bit
in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.170> half<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.829> they<00:01:46.950> managed<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
in the first half but they managed to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.819 
in the first half but they managed to
control<00:01:48.060> himself<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:49.200> try<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.439> play<00:01:49.740> our

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
control himself we will try to play our

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.999 
control himself we will try to play our
football<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> end<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.890> quite
