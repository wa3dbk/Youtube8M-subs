air<00:00:31.270> as<00:00:31.869> you<00:00:32.110> can<00:00:32.230> see<00:00:32.440> I'd<00:00:33.370> like<00:00:33.550> to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
air as you can see I'd like to

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.460 
air as you can see I'd like to
demonstrate<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:35.230> health<00:00:36.390> metering

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
demonstrate to you the health metering

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.170 
demonstrate to you the health metering
currently<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.830> sensor<00:00:39.190> is<00:00:39.309> at<00:00:39.489> 90<00:00:40.030> percent

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
currently the sensor is at 90 percent

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.500 
currently the sensor is at 90 percent
Cal<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:41.110> one<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.950> nice<00:00:42.160> things<00:00:42.190> about<00:00:42.640> our

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
Cal and one of the nice things about our

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.709 
Cal and one of the nice things about our
new<00:00:44.020> wideband<00:00:44.530> an<00:00:44.860> air<00:00:45.040> fuel<00:00:45.309> ratio

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
new wideband an air fuel ratio

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.490 
new wideband an air fuel ratio
generation<00:00:46.719> 3<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.050> that<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.350> can<00:00:47.469> actually

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
generation 3 is that it can actually

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.290 
generation 3 is that it can actually
measure<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:49.210> reaction<00:00:49.660> time<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:51.190> oxygen<00:00:51.399> so

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
measure the reaction time the oxygen so

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.209 
measure the reaction time the oxygen so
let<00:00:52.450> me<00:00:52.510> demonstrate<00:00:52.690> this<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.100> I'm

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
let me demonstrate this to you so I'm

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.280 
let me demonstrate this to you so I'm
going<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.520> bring<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.940> set<00:00:55.239> certain<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:56.050> rich

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
going to bring the set certain to rich

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.610 
going to bring the set certain to rich
conditions<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:58.300> using<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.960> slider<00:00:59.230> here<00:00:59.559> and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
conditions by using the slider here and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.279 
conditions by using the slider here and
I'm<00:01:00.520> going<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.730> blow<00:01:00.940> on<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.510> bring<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.110> back

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
I'm going to blow on it to bring it back

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.139 
I'm going to blow on it to bring it back
to<00:01:02.530> lean<00:01:03.070> conditions<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:03.760> it's<00:01:03.940> going<00:01:04.089> to

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
to lean conditions and it's going to

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.870 
to lean conditions and it's going to
measure<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.750> reaction<00:01:04.930> time<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.640> sensor

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
measure the reaction time of the sensor

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.540 
measure the reaction time of the sensor
this<00:01:07.330> gives<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.720> an<00:01:07.810> idea<00:01:07.960> how<00:01:08.380> clogged<00:01:09.250> or

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
this gives you an idea how clogged or

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.399 
this gives you an idea how clogged or
unclog<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.210> sensor<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.720> how<00:01:11.440> good

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
unclog the sensor is how good

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.780 
unclog the sensor is how good
treat<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.820> here<00:01:16.000> we<00:01:16.090> go<00:01:16.240> okay<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
treat that to you so here we go okay so

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.730 
treat that to you so here we go okay so
now<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.149> sensor<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.689> enriched<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.380> I'm<00:01:20.560> gonna

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
now the sensor is enriched and I'm gonna

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
now the sensor is enriched and I'm gonna
blow<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.159> it<00:01:21.189> here<00:01:21.759> we<00:01:21.850> go<00:01:22.649> as<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:23.950> see

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
blow on it here we go as you can see

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.899 
blow on it here we go as you can see
this<00:01:25.450> change<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.380> reaction<00:01:26.799> time<00:01:26.950> change<00:01:27.310> and

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
this change the reaction time change and

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.700 
this change the reaction time change and
that<00:01:28.450> measures<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.990> reaction<00:01:29.350> time<00:01:29.470> in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
that measures the reaction time in

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.149 
that measures the reaction time in
milliseconds<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.549> let<00:01:30.670> me<00:01:30.729> do<00:01:30.850> this<00:01:30.970> again

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.940 

and<00:01:36.729> there<00:01:36.909> we<00:01:37.090> go<00:01:37.180> so<00:01:37.390> we're<00:01:37.570> reading<00:01:37.950> 328

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
and there we go so we're reading 328

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.100 
and there we go so we're reading 328
milliseconds<00:01:39.670> now<00:01:39.789> obviously<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.719> a<00:01:40.899> real

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
milliseconds now obviously in a real

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.450 
milliseconds now obviously in a real
vehicle<00:01:41.380> you'll<00:01:41.799> be<00:01:41.890> able<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.130> get<00:01:42.189> real

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
vehicle you'll be able to get real

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.310 
vehicle you'll be able to get real
readings<00:01:42.820> instead<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.329> this<00:01:43.479> lighter

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
readings instead of this lighter

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.289 
readings instead of this lighter
demonstration<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:45.610> gives<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.030> an<00:01:46.149> idea

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
demonstration but this gives you an idea

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.639 
demonstration but this gives you an idea
how<00:01:46.539> good<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:48.399> Bosch<00:01:48.579> LSU<00:01:49.149> 4.2<00:01:49.720> sensor<00:01:50.170> can
