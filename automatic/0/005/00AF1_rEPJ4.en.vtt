with<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.600> pre<00:03:27.780> folk<00:03:28.019> at<00:03:28.200> least<00:03:28.350> anyway<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
with the pre folk at least anyway so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.509 
with the pre folk at least anyway so
seems<00:03:30.420> very<00:03:30.660> unlikely<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.530> all<00:03:32.370> these

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
seems very unlikely that all these

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.100 
seems very unlikely that all these
references<00:03:32.730> people<00:03:33.269> people<00:03:33.570> read<00:03:33.750> into<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
references people people read into it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.940 
references people people read into it
are<00:03:34.500> are<00:03:35.340> real<00:03:35.600> anyway<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.840> think<00:03:37.470> that's<00:03:37.769> all<00:03:37.920> I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
are are real anyway I think that's all I

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.410 
are are real anyway I think that's all I
want<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.220> tell<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.459> about<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.850> I've<00:03:38.970> got

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.009 
tablature to both guitar parts and we'll
just<00:03:41.760> talk<00:03:41.910> about<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.510> main<00:03:42.660> thing<00:03:42.690> I'm<00:03:42.930> gonna

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019

so<00:03:53.970> come<00:03:54.480> up<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> little<00:03:54.959> bit<00:03:55.230> digression

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.020 

tangential<00:03:59.540> anyway<00:04:00.140> about<00:04:00.740> of<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.790> picking

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
tangential anyway about of the picking

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.540 
tangential anyway about of the picking
that<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.300> peter<00:04:02.570> Yarrow<00:04:02.810> did<00:04:03.020> in<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.740> we

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
that the peter Yarrow did in this and we

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.420 
that the peter Yarrow did in this and we
will<00:04:04.640> talk<00:04:04.820> about<00:04:05.060> also<00:04:05.240> turning<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.260> into<00:04:06.500> an

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
will talk about also turning it into an

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.460 
will talk about also turning it into an
instrumental<00:04:08.180> picking<00:04:08.690> out<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.930> melody<00:04:09.200> and

instrumental picking out the melody and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.500 
instrumental picking out the melody and
this<00:04:09.770> may<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.490> may<00:04:10.640> become<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:10.970> progressive
