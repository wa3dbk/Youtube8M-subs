00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.089 
all right so we had four winners total
31<00:03:51.389> dollar<00:03:51.599> winners<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.169> 12<00:03:52.650> dollar<00:03:52.829> winner

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
31 dollar winners and 12 dollar winner

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.509 
31 dollar winners and 12 dollar winner
so<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.940> total<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.329> five<00:03:54.510> dollar<00:03:54.810> win

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
so the total of five dollar win

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.500 
so the total of five dollar win
typically<00:03:56.519> that<00:03:56.639> would<00:03:56.790> be<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> five<00:03:57.299> dollar

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
typically that would be a five dollar

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.369 
typically that would be a five dollar
loss<00:03:57.840> but<00:03:58.290> because<00:03:58.859> i<00:03:59.040> won<00:03:59.400> these<00:03:59.609> tickets

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
loss but because i won these tickets

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.990 
loss but because i won these tickets
it's<00:04:01.379> just<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.709> fine<00:04:01.859> little<00:04:02.010> profit<00:04:02.220> for<00:04:02.519> me<00:04:02.639> so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
it's just a fine little profit for me so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.879 
it's just a fine little profit for me so
