00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
with shorter time limits than the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.020 
with shorter time limits than the
at<00:01:19.720> standard<00:01:20.140> which<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.440> 99<00:01:20.920> seconds<00:01:21.490> with

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
less or more rounds than the tournament

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.190 
less or more rounds than the tournament
standard<00:01:25.060> which<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.360> best<00:01:25.570> two<00:01:25.840> out<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.050> three

standard which is best two out of three

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.260 
standard which is best two out of three
and<00:01:26.590> basically<00:01:27.370> you<00:01:27.490> could<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:27.820> fuck<00:01:28.090> with

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
and basically you could just fuck with

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.570 
and basically you could just fuck with
all<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.570> settings<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:30.130> could<00:01:30.310> literally

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
all the settings so you could literally

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.330 
all the settings so you could literally
create<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> match<00:01:31.360> where<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.170> single<00:01:32.770> round<00:01:32.980> only

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
create a match where a single round only

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.970 
create a match where a single round only
30<00:01:33.850> seconds<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.720> could<00:01:34.870> pick<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.050> coma<00:01:35.530> you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
30 seconds you could pick a coma you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.560 
30 seconds you could pick a coma you
could<00:01:36.190> jump<00:01:36.430> backwards<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.090> throw<00:01:37.270> fireballs

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
could jump backwards and throw fireballs

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.870 
could jump backwards and throw fireballs
for<00:01:38.110> 30<00:01:38.350> seconds<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.280> considering<00:01:39.850> that

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
for 30 seconds and considering that

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.670 
for 30 seconds and considering that
there<00:01:40.120> are<00:01:40.210> some<00:01:40.750> characters<00:01:41.170> who<00:01:41.320> actually

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
there are some characters who actually

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.930 
there are some characters who actually
have<00:01:41.800> a<00:01:41.860> hard<00:01:42.100> time<00:01:42.250> getting<00:01:42.430> around<00:01:42.820> that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
have a hard time getting around that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.420 
have a hard time getting around that
such<00:01:43.270> as<00:01:43.420> as<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.750> need<00:01:44.080> for<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.440> bigger<00:01:44.710> character

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
such as as a need for a bigger character

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.130 
such as as a need for a bigger character
you<00:01:45.970> could<00:01:46.150> actually<00:01:46.360> get<00:01:46.720> away<00:01:46.870> with

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
you could actually get away with

more<00:03:08.300> legitimate<00:03:08.930> for<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> ranked<00:03:09.530> play

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
more legitimate for a ranked play

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.890 
more legitimate for a ranked play
however<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.790> fact<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.269> basically<00:03:11.420> had

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
however the fact that you basically had

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.949 
however the fact that you basically had
to<00:03:12.080> erase<00:03:12.530> all<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.950> previous<00:03:13.370> ranked<00:03:13.760> match

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
to erase all the previous ranked match

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.780 
to erase all the previous ranked match
rankings<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.170> make<00:03:15.620> them<00:03:15.769> useless<00:03:16.160> because

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
rankings and make them useless because

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.610 
rankings and make them useless because
you<00:03:17.269> screwed<00:03:17.569> up<00:03:17.720> when<00:03:17.870> your<00:03:18.019> initial<00:03:18.350> release

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
you screwed up when your initial release

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.190 
you screwed up when your initial release
is<00:03:18.860> not<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.069> very<00:03:19.400> good<00:03:19.489> thing<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.989> put<00:03:21.170> out

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
is not a very good thing to put out

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.650 
is not a very good thing to put out
there<00:03:21.530> hoping<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:22.580> with<00:03:22.850> fingers<00:03:23.269> crossed

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
there hoping now with fingers crossed

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.330 
there hoping now with fingers crossed
that<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:24.319> kind<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.680> problem<00:03:25.010> does<00:03:25.130> not

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
that this kind of problem does not

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.430 
that this kind of problem does not
really<00:03:26.060> super<00:03:26.269> certain<00:03:26.660> fighter<00:03:26.810> for<00:03:27.110> next

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
really super certain fighter for next

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.350 
really super certain fighter for next
year<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.890> think<00:03:28.430> Capcom<00:03:28.850> has<00:03:29.000> learned<00:03:29.180> their
