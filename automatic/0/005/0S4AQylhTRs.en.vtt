00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello everyone hello with 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.969
 Alexander and Nato are not quite yours 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.130
 there were podcasts but somehow not up to them 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.440
 before his pound this will probably be 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.300
 quite short a lot 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.980
 Questions about our further 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.789
 plans passing and want to somehow 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 describe what we will begin with 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.750
 assassin's creed we have already passed the first 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 second part 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.510
 we have the next part 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 assassin's creed fraternity 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 the passage of which we proceed 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.050
 a little later we will do a little 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 break 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.860
 well at least i think i would like 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 fat will be equal yes and actually 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 and the seeds on the quest yes yes she is not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.910
 there was a dark game 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 oh chance of so then of plays and daleks 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.900
 very so not entertaining know 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.330
 rather in the mystical and even perhaps 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.869
 somewhat bloody plot yes yes I was 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.230
 even a little shocked to be honest in general 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.680
 do quests about it 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.790
 a small quest and then the next 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 assassin part 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.480
 it's really hard to say there 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 what will happen after that but either 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.200
 end in flames let's start an assassin either 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.180
 will end only scrambled eggs vadimov 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.799
 let's start the massage 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.759
 it will be difficult to say now and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.840
 more such a long- term look forward to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.729
 Games teacher flight at you weights out 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.579
 on April 30th it will be what is 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.890
 RPG-7 with some touch jer pg the most 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.439
 the main thing is that you can play in yours 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.780
 where there is a true game system together 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.020
 built like in nickel 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.630
 puppeteer that is, one character, as it were 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.700
 the main game this second flies helps 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.970
 we know well, in general, I will 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.380
 I donâ€™t know free application 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.599
 I think it will be very interesting and 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.630
 cool in general plans at 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.819
 at least yes, and we are looking forward to it too 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.290
 quite but although not so quite 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.710
 far but generally waiting for watch dogs 27 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.350
 may also be 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.860
 and get to go take a very 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.070
 I want to be edited and about when 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.030
 exactly the number here we called the date 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.540
 exit games 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.080
 exactly the numbers will already look at 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.870
 place 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.330
 games will be like we will be exactly 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.560
 this day with the time of the next 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 day there or a couple of days 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.410
 incomprehensible in general, we will look at 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.180
 circumstances plus everything plus 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.950
 everything knows how long it will be 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.140
 account for this or that game that is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.510
 Kassel will be among the rus now 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.460
 difficult enough i mean yes not 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.920
 forget that we have a personal life 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.280
 we work fine we have 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.440
 permanent work as if all this 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.360
 adjusts to some of his personal 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.880
 the schedule that is can vary the most 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.580
 A prime example is the FMS which is in the hands of 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.930
 we were like on the day of release but so 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.740
 he was drawn out was simply not there 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.980
 time to do 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.360
 Yes, and it makes no sense to require us to have 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.740
 we have the opportunity we lay out 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.530
 series if not possible 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.930
 no court no matter how well demand it 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.840
 superfluous 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.780
 I also want to remind you about the assassin that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.609
 we will pass all the parts from each 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.969
 series just ask i cant already 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:04:05.030
 we must look to go through all the parts 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:08.930
 in order of their release so here I think everything 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.109
 said to delay the podcast will not all 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.469
 With the bright Easter that has come, Christ 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.549
 resurrected from the wild all holiday with 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.900
 the upcoming master 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.900
 all bye everyone bye 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.420
 Yes
