and mine are pretty well insulated and
they're<00:01:39.069> also<00:01:39.249> pretty<00:01:39.609> tight<00:01:39.999> so<00:01:40.299> I'm<00:01:40.390> not

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
they're also pretty tight so I'm not

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.520 
they're also pretty tight so I'm not
gonna<00:01:40.659> have<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.960> worry<00:01:41.200> about<00:01:41.380> them<00:01:41.469> coming

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
gonna have to worry about them coming

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.219 
gonna have to worry about them coming
apart<00:01:42.009> but<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.819> do<00:01:43.060> if<00:01:43.390> they're<00:01:43.810> not<00:01:43.990> very

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
apart but you do if they're not very

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.660 
apart but you do if they're not very
tight<00:01:44.499> you<00:01:44.530> want<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.890> use<00:01:45.039> some<00:01:45.249> electrical

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
tight you want to use some electrical

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.760 
tight you want to use some electrical
tape<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:46.539> wrap<00:01:46.719> around<00:01:46.960> these<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.530> hold<00:01:47.649> them

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
tape to wrap around these and hold them

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.809 
tape to wrap around these and hold them
together<00:01:47.889> because<00:01:48.189> you're<00:01:48.429> going<00:01:48.609> to<00:01:48.700> be

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
together because you're going to be

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.969 
together because you're going to be
hanging<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.420> motor<00:01:49.630> off<00:01:49.929> into<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.770> water

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
hanging the motor off into the water

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.649 
hanging the motor off into the water
from<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.490> wires<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.060> definitely<00:01:52.299> don't

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
from the wires so you definitely don't

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.270 
from the wires so you definitely don't
want<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:52.929> slipping<00:01:53.380> off<00:01:53.530> or<00:01:54.100> coming

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
want that slipping off or coming

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.429 
want that slipping off or coming
disconnected<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.149> water<00:01:55.359> we're<00:01:56.200> gonna<00:01:56.289> go

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
disconnected in the water we're gonna go

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.169 
disconnected in the water we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:56.499> and<00:01:56.590> hook<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.889> ESC<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.670> throttle

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
ahead and hook the ESC to the throttle

your<00:02:01.209> receiver<00:02:01.569> is<00:02:01.689> turned<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:02.200> here<00:02:02.560> go<00:02:03.039> ahead

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
your receiver is turned on here go ahead

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.410 
your receiver is turned on here go ahead
and<00:02:03.310> pop<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.939> on<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:06.209> connect<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.539> battery<00:02:08.380> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and pop it on and connect the battery to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.080 
and pop it on and connect the battery to
we'll<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:10.539> ahead<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.719> pop<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.929> together<00:02:11.200> now

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
we'll go ahead and pop that together now

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.140 
we'll go ahead and pop that together now
my<00:02:13.090> speed<00:02:13.480> controllers<00:02:13.810> turned<00:02:14.079> off<00:02:14.999> so<00:02:15.999> now

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
my speed controllers turned off so now

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.390 
my speed controllers turned off so now
what<00:02:16.359> we're<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.629> do<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.069> turn<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.189> speed

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
what we're going to do is turn the speed

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.970 
what we're going to do is turn the speed
controller<00:02:18.639> on<00:02:19.319> should<00:02:20.319> go<00:02:20.469> through<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.709> little

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
controller on should go through a little

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.330 
controller on should go through a little
initial<00:02:21.489> startup<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.920> kind<00:02:24.129> of<00:02:24.159> awkward

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
initial startup it's kind of awkward

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.190 
initial startup it's kind of awkward
beat<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:24.879> anyway<00:02:25.150> once<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.049> goes<00:02:26.139> through

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
beat but anyway once it goes through

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.599 
beat but anyway once it goes through
startup<00:02:26.650> we're<00:02:26.769> going<00:02:26.889> to<00:02:26.950> test<00:02:27.159> it<00:02:27.340> just<00:02:27.370> to

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
startup we're going to test it just to

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.160 
startup we're going to test it just to
make<00:02:27.760> sure<00:02:29.790> okay<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.150> spinning<00:02:31.450> now

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
make sure okay so it is spinning now

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.479 
make sure okay so it is spinning now
what<00:02:32.379> I<00:02:32.409> like<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.709> do<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.189> don't<00:02:33.340> have<00:02:33.430> to

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
what I like to do so you don't have to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.190 
what I like to do so you don't have to
sit<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.819> hold<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> controller<00:02:34.569> you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
sit here and hold the controller you

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.690 
sit here and hold the controller you
only<00:02:35.319> do<00:02:35.469> it<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:35.590> about<00:02:35.709> 30<00:02:36.010> seconds<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.549> I'll

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
only do it for about 30 seconds but I'll

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.849 
only do it for about 30 seconds but I'll
set<00:02:36.939> my<00:02:37.060> throttle<00:02:37.540> trim<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.079> my<00:02:38.200> radio<00:02:38.499> and<00:02:38.769> you

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
set my throttle trim on my radio and you

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.580 
set my throttle trim on my radio and you
can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.540> when<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.599> adjust<00:02:40.900> my<00:02:41.049> throttle<00:02:41.409> trim

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
can see when I adjust my throttle trim

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.030 
can see when I adjust my throttle trim
it'll<00:02:41.919> spin<00:02:42.250> without<00:02:42.669> me<00:02:42.849> even<00:02:43.980> holding<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
it'll spin without me even holding the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.699 
it'll spin without me even holding the
trigger<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.870> we'll<00:02:46.989> go<00:02:47.079> ahead<00:02:47.109> and<00:02:47.319> take<00:02:47.530> our

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
trigger so we'll go ahead and take our

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.319 
trigger so we'll go ahead and take our
motor<00:02:47.919> and<00:02:48.219> we'll<00:02:48.310> get<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.579> spinning<00:02:48.849> and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
motor and we'll get it spinning and

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.149 
motor and we'll get it spinning and
that's<00:02:49.900> important<00:02:50.349> here<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> don't<00:02:50.769> want<00:02:51.069> to

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
that's important here you don't want to

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.559 
that's important here you don't want to
let<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> battery<00:02:51.879> or<00:02:52.060> any<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.449> other

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
let the battery or any of the other

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.629 
let the battery or any of the other
wires<00:02:52.870> aside<00:02:53.409> from<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.829> two<00:02:54.069> motor<00:02:54.370> wires

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
wires aside from the two motor wires

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.599 
wires aside from the two motor wires
dangle<00:02:55.180> into<00:02:55.389> the<00:02:55.480> water<00:02:55.719> you<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.889> really

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
dangle into the water you can really

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.089 
dangle into the water you can really
electrocute<00:02:58.000> yourself<00:02:58.739> it's<00:02:59.739> weird<00:03:00.010> enough

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
electrocute yourself it's weird enough

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.619 
electrocute yourself it's weird enough
that<00:03:00.459> we're<00:03:00.579> sticking<00:03:00.760> something<00:03:01.180> electric

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
that we're sticking something electric

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.890 
that we're sticking something electric
into<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.049> container<00:03:02.889> full<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.159> water<00:03:03.280> anyway

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
into a container full of water anyway

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.420 
into a container full of water anyway
but<00:03:04.900> that's<00:03:05.199> part<00:03:05.439> of<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:05.859> just<00:03:06.129> be<00:03:06.250> real

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
but that's part of it so just be real

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.709 
but that's part of it so just be real
careful<00:03:06.639> with<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.329> we'll<00:03:07.419> go<00:03:07.510> ahead<00:03:07.540> and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
careful with that so we'll go ahead and

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.259 
careful with that so we'll go ahead and
eat<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.810> motor<00:03:08.019> spinning<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.060> I'm<00:03:10.150> gonna

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
eat the motor spinning and I'm gonna

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.819 
eat the motor spinning and I'm gonna
vary<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.719> speeds<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.109> little<00:03:11.319> bit<00:03:11.439> but<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.650> think

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
vary the speeds a little bit but I think

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.870 
vary the speeds a little bit but I think
this<00:03:11.919> is<00:03:12.069> good<00:03:12.219> for<00:03:12.400> now

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.290 

as<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.330> it's<00:03:19.480> been<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.750> nice<00:03:21.300> gonna

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
as you can see it's been a nice gonna

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.480 
as you can see it's been a nice gonna
let<00:03:22.510> spin<00:03:22.750> probably<00:03:23.080> about<00:03:23.200> 30<00:03:23.740> seconds<00:03:24.310> will

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
let spin probably about 30 seconds will

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.240 
let spin probably about 30 seconds will
slow<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.760> down<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:25.000> little<00:03:25.090> bit

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
slow it down a little bit

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:48.330 
slow it down a little bit
speed<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.370> up<00:03:27.460> just<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.790> little<00:03:27.820> bit<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:48.190> what

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
speed it up just a little bit and what

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.610 
speed it up just a little bit and what
this<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.670> gonna<00:03:48.820> do<00:03:49.120> as<00:03:49.510> its<00:03:49.990> spinning<00:03:50.320> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
this is gonna do as its spinning the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.680 
this is gonna do as its spinning the
water<00:03:50.860> actually<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.490> buffer<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.480> kinda

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
water actually the buffer it's kinda

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.770 
water actually the buffer it's kinda
like<00:03:52.750> wet<00:03:52.990> sanding<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.760> brush<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.330> when

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
like wet sanding so the brush is when

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.330 
like wet sanding so the brush is when
this<00:03:55.930> motor<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.260> made<00:03:56.470> or<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:56.710> evenly<00:03:57.220> in

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
this motor is made or not evenly in

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.750 
this motor is made or not evenly in
contact<00:03:57.850> with<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> surface<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.760> that's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
contact with the surface and that's

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.550 
contact with the surface and that's
gonna<00:04:00.940> cause<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.390> working<00:04:01.780> effectively<00:04:02.050> so

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
gonna cause it to working effectively so

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.780 
gonna cause it to working effectively so
what<00:04:02.740> you're<00:04:02.890> doing<00:04:03.160> you're<00:04:03.280> basically

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
what you're doing you're basically

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.410 
what you're doing you're basically
sanding<00:04:04.510> down<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:05.710> surfaces<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:07.180> brush

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
sanding down the surfaces of the brush

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.840 
sanding down the surfaces of the brush
where<00:04:07.690> they<00:04:07.780> come<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:08.050> contact<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:09.520> giving<00:04:09.760> it

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
where they come in contact and giving it

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.220 
where they come in contact and giving it
more<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.060> an<00:04:10.120> even<00:04:10.330> surface<00:04:10.630> which<00:04:11.080> will

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
more of an even surface which will

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.630 
more of an even surface which will
translate<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.710> more<00:04:12.010> efficient<00:04:12.490> power

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
translate to more efficient power
