00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
made that yeah I feel quite clever the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.690 
made that yeah I feel quite clever the
only<00:02:37.080> downside<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> game<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.520> it

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
only downside I have to the game is it

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.640 
only downside I have to the game is it
scores<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.470> itself

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
scores you and that in and of itself

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.850 
scores you and that in and of itself
isn't<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.520> much<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> problem<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.080> clearly

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
isn't so much the problem but it clearly

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.620 
isn't so much the problem but it clearly
gives<00:02:44.220> an<00:02:44.340> idea<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> better<00:02:45.330> way

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
gives an idea that there's a better way

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.900 
gives an idea that there's a better way
to<00:02:45.690> play<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.140> game<00:02:46.320> then<00:02:46.620> otherwise<00:02:47.040> okay<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
to play the game then otherwise okay and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.760 
to play the game then otherwise okay and
that<00:02:48.090> kind<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> runs<00:02:48.690> contrary<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.470> idea

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
that kind of runs contrary to this idea

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.980 
that kind of runs contrary to this idea
of<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.490> as<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:50.970> fit<00:02:51.180> find<00:02:51.750> your<00:02:51.900> own

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
of do it as you see fit find your own

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.170 
of do it as you see fit find your own
play<00:02:52.230> style<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.770> adapt<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.580> that

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
play style and adapt to it and that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.940 
play style and adapt to it and that
would<00:02:54.570> have<00:02:54.600> still<00:02:54.870> been<00:02:54.930> acceptable<00:02:55.530> except

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
would have still been acceptable except

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.400 
would have still been acceptable except
as<00:02:56.100> you're<00:02:56.550> playing<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.120> level<00:02:57.540> you'll<00:02:58.230> see

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
as you're playing the level you'll see

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.590 
as you're playing the level you'll see
points<00:02:58.710> taken<00:02:58.860> away<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.370> not<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.090> murders<00:03:00.450> are

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
points taken away so not all murders are

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.150 
points taken away so not all murders are
creative<00:03:00.930> eat<00:03:01.050> cream<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.920> really

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
creative eat cream right they really

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.620 
creative eat cream right they really
seem<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.550> want<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.000> not<00:03:03.210> kill<00:03:03.450> anyone

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
seem to want you to not kill anyone

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.050 
seem to want you to not kill anyone
other<00:03:04.080> than<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.350> target<00:03:04.800> themselves<00:03:05.580> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
other than the target themselves and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.330 
other than the target themselves and
that<00:03:06.660> kind<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.960> makes<00:03:07.170> sense<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.740> mean<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.160> are

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
that kind of makes sense I mean you are

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.920 
that kind of makes sense I mean you are
a<00:03:08.370> hit<00:03:08.610> man<00:03:08.790> well<00:03:09.090> yeah<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.300> know<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.600> should<00:03:09.900> oh

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
a hit man well yeah I know you should oh

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.870 
a hit man well yeah I know you should oh
the<00:03:10.080> bill<00:03:10.320> more<00:03:10.650> yeah<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.310> from<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
the bill more yeah I think from the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.970 
the bill more yeah I think from the
client<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:13.170> start<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> kill<00:03:13.590> other<00:03:13.770> people

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
client if you start to kill other people

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.310 
client if you start to kill other people
but<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:14.970> doesn't<00:03:15.480> set<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.080> rules

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
but and it doesn't set that out as rules

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.930 
but and it doesn't set that out as rules
and<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.710> start<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.250> these<00:03:17.460> kind<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.790> very

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and you start to see these kind of very

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.080 
and you start to see these kind of very
disincentive<00:03:18.750> izing<00:03:19.140> red<00:03:19.890> markers<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:21.000> know

fill<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.450> screen<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.870> okay<00:03:22.110> you've<00:03:22.230> lost

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
fill the screen like okay you've lost

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.750 
fill the screen like okay you've lost
this<00:03:22.530> many<00:03:22.740> points<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.100> many<00:03:23.340> points<00:03:23.640> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
this many points this many points and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000 
this many points this many points and
that<00:03:24.480> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.020> curtails<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.710> desire<00:03:25.980> to

that kind of curtails that desire to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.730 
that kind of curtails that desire to
experiment<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.910> find<00:03:27.090> other<00:03:27.330> ways<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.680> if

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
experiment in to find other ways so if

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.070 
experiment in to find other ways so if
you<00:03:28.830> can<00:03:28.950> somehow<00:03:29.040> ignore<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.930> can

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
you can somehow ignore that you can

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080 
you can somehow ignore that you can
replay<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.590> levels<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.190> 30<00:03:32.460> far<00:03:33.000> more

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
replay the levels in like 30 far more

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.730 
replay the levels in like 30 far more

dynamic ways of resolving the problems

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.770 
dynamic ways of resolving the problems
at<00:03:34.830> hand<00:03:34.860> then<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.310> first<00:03:35.580> realize<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.630> is

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
at hand then you first realize and it is

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.180 
at hand then you first realize and it is
quite<00:03:36.990> something<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.740> now<00:03:37.830> I've<00:03:37.980> never

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
quite something so now I've never

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.740 
quite something so now I've never
actually<00:03:38.370> played<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.850> series<00:03:39.150> before<00:03:39.360> what

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
actually played this series before what

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.810 
actually played this series before what
would<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.140> liken<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.800> for<00:03:41.310> people<00:03:41.430> who<00:03:41.670> may

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
would you liken it to for people who may

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.510 
would you liken it to for people who may
be<00:03:41.880> new<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.540> would<00:03:43.470> say<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.770> closest<00:03:44.340> is

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
be new to it I would say the closest is

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.520 
be new to it I would say the closest is
somewhere<00:03:45.000> like<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.420> Splinter<00:03:45.840> Cell<00:03:46.080> series

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
somewhere like the Splinter Cell series

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.760 
somewhere like the Splinter Cell series
uh<00:03:47.520> with<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> mixture<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.540> think<00:03:48.960> of<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.620> more

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
uh with a mixture I think of the more

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.800 
uh with a mixture I think of the more
recent<00:03:49.920> game<00:03:50.310> dishonored<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.120> Dave<00:03:51.330> oh<00:03:51.450> I

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
recent game dishonored and Dave oh I

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.780 
recent game dishonored and Dave oh I
love<00:03:52.080> dishonored<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.830> sec<00:03:53.130> sighs<00:03:53.280> it's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
love dishonored and a sec sighs it's

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.970 
love dishonored and a sec sighs it's
nowhere<00:03:54.300> near<00:03:54.330> as<00:03:54.690> open<00:03:55.440> as<00:03:55.710> your

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
nowhere near as open as your

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.530 
nowhere near as open as your
opportunities<00:03:56.430> are<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.670> those<00:03:56.910> games<00:03:57.180> like

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
opportunities are in those games like

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.820 
opportunities are in those games like
there<00:03:57.870> they<00:03:58.080> just<00:03:58.110> kind<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.440> set<00:03:58.650> up<00:03:58.680> the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
there they just kind of set up the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.620 
there they just kind of set up the
physics<00:03:59.160> set<00:03:59.310> up<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.490> your<00:03:59.610> skills<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.060> let

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
physics set up with your skills and let

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.650 
physics set up with your skills and let
you<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:00.960> but<00:04:01.710> it's<00:04:02.640> kind<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.120> middle<00:04:03.450> of

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
you go but it's kind of the middle of

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.030 
you go but it's kind of the middle of
the<00:04:03.750> two<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.080> doesn't<00:04:04.380> move<00:04:04.470> as<00:04:04.620> slowly<00:04:04.860> a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
the two it doesn't move as slowly a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.440 
the two it doesn't move as slowly a
splinter<00:04:05.340> cell<00:04:05.520> in<00:04:05.700> some<00:04:05.880> some<00:04:06.210> of<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.330> word

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
splinter cell in some some of the word

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.120 
splinter cell in some some of the word
traditional<00:04:07.110> stealth<00:04:07.380> games<00:04:07.620> which<00:04:07.980> i<00:04:08.070> think

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
traditional stealth games which i think

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.480 
traditional stealth games which i think
is<00:04:08.280> good<00:04:08.490> so<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.330> if<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.600> do<00:04:09.750> screw<00:04:10.080> up

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
is good so that if you do screw up

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.740 
is good so that if you do screw up
restarting<00:04:11.490> isn't<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.880> kind<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.150> oh<00:04:12.330> now<00:04:12.660> I'm

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
restarting isn't this kind of oh now I'm

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.500 
restarting isn't this kind of oh now I'm
going<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.990> crawl<00:04:13.320> across<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.280> floor<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:15.390> now

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510

but yes it is and it looks absolutely

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.190 
but yes it is and it looks absolutely
astounding<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.390> all<00:04:24.540> of<00:04:24.690> them<00:04:24.840> but<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.500> pc

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
astounding on all of them but that pc

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.720 
astounding on all of them but that pc
of<00:04:26.260> course<00:04:26.560> has<00:04:26.890> that<00:04:27.070> edge<00:04:27.190> if<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.490> have<00:04:27.640> the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
of course has that edge if you have the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.580 
of course has that edge if you have the
hardware<00:04:27.910> for<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.510> it's<00:04:28.630> kind<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:29.200> it<00:04:29.380> I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
hardware for it and it's kind of it I

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.560 
hardware for it and it's kind of it I
think<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.190> gives<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> sense<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.150> what<00:04:31.450> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
think it gives you a sense of what the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.150 
think it gives you a sense of what the
next<00:04:31.720> generation<00:04:32.290> console<00:04:32.650> games<00:04:32.800> will<00:04:33.040> be

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
next generation console games will be

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.380 
next generation console games will be
looking<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:33.850> if<00:04:33.940> people<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.360> a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
looking like so if people have a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.270 
looking like so if people have a
multi-platform<00:04:35.080> situation<00:04:35.830> at<00:04:35.950> home<00:04:36.070> they

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
multi-platform situation at home they

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.860 
multi-platform situation at home they
should<00:04:36.430> probably<00:04:36.580> go<00:04:37.000> with<00:04:37.120> pc<00:04:37.540> if<00:04:37.690> that's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
should probably go with pc if that's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.050 
should probably go with pc if that's
available<00:04:37.990> today<00:04:38.380> if<00:04:38.800> visuals<00:04:39.700> are<00:04:39.910> your

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
available today if visuals are your

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.300 
available today if visuals are your
primary<00:04:40.300> concern<00:04:40.870> um<00:04:41.170> i<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:41.680> for<00:04:42.100> these

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
primary concern um i think for these

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.430 
primary concern um i think for these
types<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.580> games<00:04:42.640> what<00:04:43.300> what<00:04:43.480> controller<00:04:44.110> is

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
types of games what what controller is

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.370 
types of games what what controller is
or<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:45.250> your<00:04:45.700> happy<00:04:45.970> place<00:04:46.090> that's<00:04:46.960> probably

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
or is your happy place that's probably

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.710 
or is your happy place that's probably
going<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.620> dictate<00:04:47.860> which<00:04:48.310> system<00:04:49.240> about<00:04:49.600> how

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
going to dictate which system about how

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.320 
going to dictate which system about how
many<00:04:49.870> hours<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.470> gameplay<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:51.070> there<00:04:51.250> say<00:04:51.490> you

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
many hours of gameplay is there say you

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.170 
many hours of gameplay is there say you
can<00:04:52.540> probably<00:04:52.930> push<00:04:53.200> 20<00:04:53.860> it's<00:04:54.730> good<00:04:54.910> in<00:04:55.030> that

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
can probably push 20 it's good in that

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.030 
can probably push 20 it's good in that
you<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.170> find<00:04:56.320> very<00:04:56.440> quick<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.710> efficient

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
you can find very quick and efficient

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.380 
you can find very quick and efficient
ways<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.190> kill<00:04:57.430> people<00:04:57.460> there's<00:04:58.000> also<00:04:58.150> some

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
ways to kill people there's also some

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.360 
ways to kill people there's also some
very<00:04:58.720> sort<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.080> lugubrious<00:04:59.590> ways<00:05:00.010> they<00:05:00.220> can<00:05:00.280> be

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
very sort of lugubrious ways they can be

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.970 
very sort of lugubrious ways they can be
a<00:05:00.400> lot<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.640> fun<00:05:00.940> also<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:02.140> really<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.680> trying<00:05:02.830> to

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
a lot of fun also it really is trying to

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.140 
a lot of fun also it really is trying to
go<00:05:03.040> back<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.220> replay<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.670> levels<00:05:03.910> they<00:05:04.030> have

yes<00:05:23.320> can<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.500> do<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.770> um<00:05:24.030> there<00:05:25.030> are

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
yes can you do that um there are

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.970 
yes can you do that um there are
elements<00:05:25.630> that<00:05:25.930> kind<00:05:26.350> of<00:05:26.440> play<00:05:26.590> into<00:05:26.860> that

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
elements that kind of play into that

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.650 
elements that kind of play into that
nothing<00:05:27.670> I<00:05:27.820> haven't<00:05:28.000> discovered<00:05:28.360> something

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
nothing I haven't discovered something

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.180 
nothing I haven't discovered something
that<00:05:28.810> allow<00:05:29.200> trait<00:05:29.470> but<00:05:29.620> you're<00:05:29.860> giving<00:05:30.010> me

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
that allow trait but you're giving me

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.160 
that allow trait but you're giving me
ideas<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.730> want<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.060> experiment<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.870> didn't

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
ideas I want to experiment I didn't

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.780 
ideas I want to experiment I didn't
actually<00:05:32.380> expect<00:05:32.680> there<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.130> be<00:05:33.250> them<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:33.760> I

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
actually expect there to be them but I

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.890 
actually expect there to be them but I
thought<00:05:34.000> maybe<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.360> could<00:05:34.480> hack<00:05:34.660> something

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
thought maybe you could hack something

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.480 
thought maybe you could hack something
together<00:05:35.200> know<00:05:35.500> if<00:05:35.620> they<00:05:35.710> did<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:35.920> game<00:05:36.250> mouse

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
together know if they did a game mouse

together know if they did a game mouse
trap<00:05:36.520> yes<00:05:37.450> death<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.760> think<00:05:39.760> we<00:05:39.880> hope<00:05:40.030> together

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
trap yes death I think we hope together

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.270 
trap yes death I think we hope together
I<00:05:40.660> think<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:41.350> don't<00:05:41.560> think<00:05:41.950> that's<00:05:42.100> a<00:05:42.160> new

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
I think I don't think that's a new

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.510 
I think I don't think that's a new
franchise<00:05:42.430> exactly<00:05:43.180> um<00:05:43.480> so<00:05:43.990> so<00:05:44.380> what<00:05:44.950> about<00:05:45.010> it

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
franchise exactly um so so what about it

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.010 
franchise exactly um so so what about it
does<00:05:45.970> not<00:05:46.180> get<00:05:46.450> your<00:05:46.600> seal<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:46.840> approval

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
does not get your seal of approval

does not get your seal of approval
what's<00:05:47.590> going<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:47.890> have<00:05:47.980> a<00:05:48.040> downside<00:05:48.430> Judy

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
what's going to have a downside Judy

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.260 
what's going to have a downside Judy
Jane<00:05:49.000> primarily<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.770> scoring<00:05:51.190> system<00:05:51.730> which

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
Jane primarily this scoring system which

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.270 
Jane primarily this scoring system which
really<00:05:52.600> just<00:05:52.720> kind<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.290> it's<00:05:53.440> like<00:05:53.590> ah<00:05:53.740> yeah

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
really just kind of it's like ah yeah

really just kind of it's like ah yeah
but<00:05:54.490> I'm<00:05:54.670> really<00:05:55.210> big<00:05:55.600> on<00:05:55.750> encouraging<00:05:56.320> the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
but I'm really big on encouraging the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.680 
but I'm really big on encouraging the
player<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:57.700> do<00:05:57.850> what<00:05:58.000> they<00:05:58.090> want<00:05:58.360> you<00:05:58.540> know<00:05:58.570> to
