00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
round when you go home and I think I

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.630 
round when you go home and I think I
died<00:04:35.570> one<00:04:35.990> more<00:04:36.230> time<00:04:36.560> here<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.310> it's

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640

probably<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:38.030> stupid<00:04:38.270> death<00:04:38.600> but<00:04:38.930> whatever<00:04:39.890> I

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
probably a stupid death but whatever I

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.320 
probably a stupid death but whatever I
think<00:04:40.370> we're<00:04:40.490> gonna<00:04:40.580> win<00:04:40.700> around<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.240> it's

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
think we're gonna win around and it's

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.420 
think we're gonna win around and it's
gonna<00:04:41.420> be<00:04:41.480> done<00:04:44.410> switching<00:04:45.410> sides<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:49.370> we

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
gonna be done switching sides that we

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.380 
gonna be done switching sides that we
run<00:04:49.490> off<00:04:49.700> its<00:04:49.910> again<00:04:50.210> suction<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.110> go<00:04:51.410> figure

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
run off its again suction just go figure

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.240 
run off its again suction just go figure
so<00:04:53.590> now<00:04:54.590> i<00:04:54.620> think<00:04:54.980> i<00:04:55.010> could<00:04:55.070> kill<00:04:55.340> here<00:04:55.460> by<00:04:55.550> nate

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
so now i think i could kill here by nate

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.430 
so now i think i could kill here by nate
