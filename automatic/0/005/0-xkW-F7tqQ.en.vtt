it's<00:00:40.890> curved<00:00:41.579> back<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.530> clean

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's curved back here and I would clean

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
it's curved back here and I would clean
out<00:00:43.860> all<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.579> under<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> pine<00:00:45.239> tree

got this concrete retaining wall here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.340 
got this concrete retaining wall here
that<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.710> need<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.040> mindful<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
that we need to be mindful of and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.670 
that we need to be mindful of and
there's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> swale<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:12.720> runs<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.260> through

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there's a swale that runs right through

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.560 
there's a swale that runs right through
here<00:01:14.159> SW<00:01:15.030> al<00:01:15.659> e<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.350> low<00:01:16.920> place<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.759> shed<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
here SW al e a low place to shed the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
here SW al e a low place to shed the
water<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.229> understand<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
water because I understand that that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.840 
water because I understand that that
your<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:21.119> drainage<00:01:22.020> works<00:01:22.619> from<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
your your drainage works from the top of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.940 
your your drainage works from the top of
the<00:01:23.909> property<00:01:24.390> down<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.080> hits<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.409> swale<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the property down so it hits a swale and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.469 
the property down so it hits a swale and
goes<00:01:26.100> around<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.549> whatever<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
goes around so whatever we do we have to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
goes around so whatever we do we have to
be<00:01:27.570> mindful<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.369> let's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
be mindful of that all right now let's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.819 
be mindful of that all right now let's
erase<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.140> started<00:01:33.350> I'm<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
erase this and get started I'm going to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.679 
erase this and get started I'm going to
keep<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.369> line<00:01:35.579> there<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.240> remained

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
keep that line there so we remained

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.920 
keep that line there so we remained
mindful<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.490> would<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
mindful of it what I would do is as you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
mindful of it what I would do is as you
don't<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.500> any<00:01:40.680> trees<00:01:41.040> let's<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:41.610> with

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
don't have any trees let's start with

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
don't have any trees let's start with
framing<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> house<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.710> certainly<00:01:44.070> come

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
framing the house I would certainly come

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
framing the house I would certainly come
down<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> framing

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
down here and think about the framing

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.210 
down here and think about the framing
the<00:01:46.530> house<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.979> two<00:01:47.220> kinds<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.820> trees<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the house with two kinds of trees the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.130 
the house with two kinds of trees the
very<00:01:50.460> least<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.210> would<00:01:51.360> even<00:01:51.450> come<00:01:51.840> along

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
very least and I would even come along

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.130 
very least and I would even come along
this<00:01:52.380> driveway<00:01:52.770> perhaps<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> trees<00:01:54.360> but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this driveway perhaps with the trees but

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
this driveway perhaps with the trees but
you<00:01:55.380> could<00:01:55.740> line<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> driveway<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.790> red

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you could line the driveway with red

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
you could line the driveway with red
maple<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.990> gorgeous<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> fall<00:01:59.040> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
fast-growing variety which will do well

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.840 
fast-growing variety which will do well
in<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:03.930> part<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> world<00:02:04.860> will<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
in your part of the world will be the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.389 
in your part of the world will be the
tulip<00:02:06.180> poplar<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> could<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.649> maybe<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
tulip poplar so you could have maybe a
tulip<00:02:08.759> poplar<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.569> then<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.349> some

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
tulip poplar here then think about some

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.559 
tulip poplar here then think about some
ornamentals<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> use

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.330 
okay now let's take a look at the
foundation<00:02:32.280> planting<00:02:33.180> I'd<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.230> echo<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
foundation planting I'd like to echo the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.369 
foundation planting I'd like to echo the
color<00:02:35.609> off<00:02:35.939> of<00:02:36.209> your<00:02:36.420> shutters<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.079> have<00:02:37.230> that

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
color off of your shutters you have that

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.610

sort<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.590> burgundy<00:02:38.040> color<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.549> what<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.909> we

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
sort of burgundy color so what if we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.229 
sort of burgundy color so what if we
covered<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.919> concrete<00:02:41.459> retaining<00:02:41.669> wall

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
covered this concrete retaining wall

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.899 
covered this concrete retaining wall
with<00:02:42.510> red<00:02:42.719> Laura<00:02:43.019> peplum<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.859> what<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.790> we

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
with red Laura peplum and what if we

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.610 
with red Laura peplum and what if we
came<00:02:45.090> over<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.419> and<00:02:45.719> created<00:02:46.200> some<00:02:46.409> red

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
came over here and created some red

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.039 
came over here and created some red
Laura<00:02:46.919> petal<00:02:47.370> I'll<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.639> a<00:02:47.790> drift<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.569> here

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
Laura petal I'll just a drift of it here

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.800 
Laura petal I'll just a drift of it here
so<00:02:49.370> again<00:02:50.370> we're<00:02:50.579> balancing<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.269> property

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so again we're balancing the property

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.020 
so again we're balancing the property
and<00:02:51.989> then<00:02:52.500> what<00:02:52.799> if<00:02:52.889> we<00:02:52.949> came<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.519> corners

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
and then what if we came on the corners

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.409 
and then what if we came on the corners
and<00:02:54.060> planted<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.889> Foster<00:02:55.889> Holly<00:02:56.129> here<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.969> a

Foster Holly here kind of a nice conical
Holly<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.949> then<00:03:02.579> on<00:03:02.939> either<00:03:03.780> side

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
Holly like that and then on either side

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.520 
Holly like that and then on either side
of<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.639> interior<00:03:06.359> with<00:03:06.659> this<00:03:06.780> Foster<00:03:07.319> Holly

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
of the interior with this Foster Holly

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.000 
of the interior with this Foster Holly
is<00:03:07.799> let's<00:03:08.189> do<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> big<00:03:09.000> bank<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.870> low<00:03:10.169> azaleas

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
is let's do a big bank of low azaleas

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.110 
is let's do a big bank of low azaleas
here<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:12.379> here<00:03:13.579> you<00:03:14.579> didn't<00:03:14.849> give<00:03:14.939> me<00:03:14.969> any

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
here and here you didn't give me any

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.249 
here and here you didn't give me any
directions<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.109> exactly<00:03:17.359> if<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.569> house<00:03:18.720> faces

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
directions on exactly if the house faces

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.899 
directions on exactly if the house faces
north<00:03:19.500> or<00:03:19.709> south<00:03:19.979> or<00:03:20.220> whatever<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:20.819> I'm

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
north or south or whatever so I'm

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.759 
north or south or whatever so I'm
assuming<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.569> could<00:03:21.810> grow<00:03:22.019> as<00:03:22.139> areas<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
assuming you could grow as areas if it

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.770 
assuming you could grow as areas if it
don't<00:03:23.189> need<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.489> grown<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.180> full<00:03:24.509> hot<00:03:24.750> Sun

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
don't need to be grown in full hot Sun

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830 
don't need to be grown in full hot Sun
and<00:03:25.470> then<00:03:25.919> what<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.489> would<00:03:26.609> suggest<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:27.629> is<00:03:27.780> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and then what I would suggest here is a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.050 
and then what I would suggest here is a
different<00:03:28.349> type<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.680> shrub<00:03:29.629> one<00:03:30.629> there<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
different type of shrub one there and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.429 
different type of shrub one there and
there<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.479> there<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.509> one<00:03:36.509> there<00:03:36.810> where<00:03:37.319> we

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
there and there and one there where we

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.759 
there and there and one there where we
create<00:03:37.889> rhythm<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.329> one<00:03:39.629> two<00:03:39.959> three

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
create rhythm so we have one two three

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.969 
create rhythm so we have one two three
four<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.720> those<00:03:43.109> could<00:03:43.259> be<00:03:43.319> any<00:03:43.620> type<00:03:43.949> of

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
four and those could be any type of

four and those could be any type of
evergreed<00:03:44.699> like<00:03:45.060> something<00:03:45.569> slightly

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
evergreed like something slightly

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.949 
evergreed like something slightly
columnar<00:03:46.560> they<00:03:46.709> could<00:03:46.919> be<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.579> Japanese<00:03:48.449> plum

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
columnar they could be a Japanese plum

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.860 
columnar they could be a Japanese plum
you<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.650> could<00:03:49.859> be<00:03:50.120> some<00:03:51.120> sort<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.479> Holly

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
you they could be some sort of Holly

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.780 
you they could be some sort of Holly
that<00:03:52.229> would<00:03:52.409> stay<00:03:52.620> very<00:03:52.919> small<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:53.609> your

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
that would stay very small but your

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.580 
that would stay very small but your
punctuating<00:03:54.479> all<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.720> way<00:03:54.810> across<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.379> house
