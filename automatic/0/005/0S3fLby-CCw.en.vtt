00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
floating row cover but it looks like my

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.720 
floating row cover but it looks like my
broccoli<00:00:32.040> survived<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.790> me<00:00:32.969> time<00:00:33.329> will<00:00:33.540> tell

we're sis to finally get some warm

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770 
we're sis to finally get some warm
weather<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.610> into<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> 60s<00:00:39.390> week

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
weather which just get into the 60s week

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.280 
weather which just get into the 60s week
so<00:00:40.140> um<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:41.850> guess<00:00:42.210> we'll<00:00:42.540> find<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so um I guess we'll find out and the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170 
so um I guess we'll find out and the
days<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.710> getting<00:00:43.829> longer<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.940> there

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
days are getting longer think there

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
days are getting longer think there
about<00:00:45.780> ten<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> half<00:00:46.440> hours<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.300> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
about ten and a half hours right now it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.060 
about ten and a half hours right now it
should<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.539> long<00:00:48.899> enough<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.350> start<00:00:49.620> growing

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.619 

so<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> most<00:00:57.000> stuff<00:00:57.300> has<00:00:57.420> done<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
so actually the most stuff has done a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.819 
so actually the most stuff has done a
lot<00:00:57.840> better<00:00:57.870> than<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> thought<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
lot better than I thought it was a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
lot better than I thought it was a
carrot<00:00:59.340> weren't<00:00:59.969> even<00:01:00.180> covered<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> was

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
carrot weren't even covered and it was

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.709 
carrot weren't even covered and it was
negative<00:01:01.289> 10<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:02.879> they're

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
negative 10 in there you can see they're

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
negative 10 in there you can see they're
still<00:01:03.989> small<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.799> doing<00:01:05.760> fine<00:01:06.000> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
still small but they're doing fine just

some<00:01:19.259> early<00:01:19.439> spring<00:01:19.890> vegetables<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:22.700> cold

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
some early spring vegetables and cold

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.499 
some early spring vegetables and cold
frames<00:01:24.060> paints<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:26.060> spinach<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
frames paints the spinach and the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.560 
frames paints the spinach and the
lettuce<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> ground<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:30.240> even<00:01:30.299> fazed

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
lettuce is in the ground not even fazed

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
lettuce is in the ground not even fazed
the<00:01:33.570> Oriental<00:01:34.020> greens<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> air

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the Oriental greens are up in the air

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
the Oriental greens are up in the air
you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.820> they're<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.600> much<00:01:36.840> dead

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you can see they're all pretty much dead

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
you can see they're all pretty much dead
I<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.280> might<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.520> brought<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.090> bugs

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I think I might have brought some bugs

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.850 
I think I might have brought some bugs
in<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.990> lettuce<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> got<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
in with that lettuce I got from a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.420 
in with that lettuce I got from a
greenhouse<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.270> fall<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
greenhouse this fall so I think that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
greenhouse this fall so I think that
might<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> reason<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:46.170> doing<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
might be the reason that's not doing so

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.850 
might be the reason that's not doing so
good<00:01:47.630> hmm<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> first<00:01:49.590> kale

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
good hmm you can see that first kale

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.380 
good hmm you can see that first kale
plant<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.310> planted<00:01:50.729> there

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
plant I planted there

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
plant I planted there
doing<00:01:51.840> fine<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:53.070> piece<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
doing fine and that little piece of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.530 
doing fine and that little piece of
Swiss<00:01:53.700> chard<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.150> doing<00:01:54.510> fine<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:56.540> again

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
Swiss chard is doing fine so and again

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
Swiss chard is doing fine so and again

and this cold frame had about three or
four<00:02:04.979> inches<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.460> snow<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> i<00:02:07.800> don't

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
four inches of snow on it so i don't

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.820 
four inches of snow on it so i don't
know<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> help<00:02:08.670> protect<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.270> or<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:10.590> what

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
know if that help protect it or or what

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
know if that help protect it or or what

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
but it it all survived this cold frame

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.580 
but it it all survived this cold frame
also<00:02:17.040> doing<00:02:17.400> pretty<00:02:17.580> good<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.320> the
