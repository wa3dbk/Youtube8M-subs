don't know it does block a lot of your

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.410 
don't know it does block a lot of your
view<00:00:50.219> especially<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.760> those<00:00:50.879> meet<00:00:51.090> into<00:00:51.239> long

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
view especially if those meet into long

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020 
view especially if those meet into long
ranges<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.590> typically<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.460> run<00:00:53.699> some

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
ranges so so typically I will run some

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.240 
ranges so so typically I will run some
sort<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> optic<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.020> thing<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
want to you can try to use the iron

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.810 
want to you can try to use the iron
sights<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.469> sometimes<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.190> may<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.640> be

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

ideal now I'm next up for the damage
this<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.070> where<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.520> thing<00:01:02.820> absolutely

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
this is where this thing absolutely

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
this is where this thing absolutely
shines<00:01:04.049> 40<00:01:04.799> damage<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.309> close<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.880> one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
shines 40 damage up close which is one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.520 
shines 40 damage up close which is one
of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> most<00:01:06.270> powerful<00:01:06.630> assault<00:01:06.960> rifles<00:01:07.350> in

of the most powerful assault rifles in
the<00:01:07.740> game<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> might<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> most

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the game I think it might be the most

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.480 
the game I think it might be the most
powerful<00:01:09.119> I'm<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.020> 24<00:01:10.530> damage<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> distance

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

rest the mag fires about 600 rpm which
is<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.810> big<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> difference

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
is really not that big of a difference

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.859 
is really not that big of a difference
but<00:01:38.159> hey<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> mean<00:01:39.150> if<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.360> burst<00:01:39.570> frying

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
but hey I mean if your burst frying

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.210 
but hey I mean if your burst frying
you're<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.200> firing<00:01:40.409> faster<00:01:40.860> putting<00:01:41.100> more

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you're to be firing faster putting more

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.740 
you're to be firing faster putting more
bullets<00:01:41.490> downrange<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.060> hopefully<00:01:42.450> killing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
bullets downrange and hopefully killing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
bullets downrange and hopefully killing
more<00:01:42.869> enemies<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> keep<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.710> mind<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
more enemies to keep that in mind now a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670 
more enemies to keep that in mind now a
next<00:01:44.759> step<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> recoil<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
next step as for the recoil this is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
next step as for the recoil this is
where<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.460> struggles<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
where this thing really struggles so

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
where this thing really struggles so
it's<00:01:48.299> got<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:48.689> decent<00:01:48.750> rate<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> fire

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
it's got a pretty decent rate of fire

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.350 
it's got a pretty decent rate of fire
it's<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> super<00:01:49.979> high<00:01:50.340> damage<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.240> it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's got a super high damage but it's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.969 
it's got a super high damage but it's
got<00:01:51.540> awful<00:01:52.140> recoil<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.860> have

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
got awful recoil if you don't have

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
got awful recoil if you don't have
anything<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> thing<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
anything on a but the thing is if you

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.709 
anything on a but the thing is if you
put<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> four<00:01:55.829> grip<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.820> turns<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.329> into<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
put a four grip on it it turns it into a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.209 
put a four grip on it it turns it into a
laser<00:01:58.079> weapon<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.590> fore<00:01:58.799> grip<00:01:58.950> has<00:01:59.100> a

laser weapon the fore grip has a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.520 
laser weapon the fore grip has a

weapon<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.690> meant<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.170> be<00:02:52.380> high<00:02:52.620> damage<00:02:53.070> if

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
weapon it's meant to be high damage if

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.530 
weapon it's meant to be high damage if
you<00:02:53.280> run<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> silencer<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.150> reduce<00:02:54.390> its

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
you run a silencer and you reduce its

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.480 
you run a silencer and you reduce its
range<00:02:54.780> you're<00:02:55.170> taking<00:02:55.590> away<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.280> thing

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
range you're taking away what this thing

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.150 
range you're taking away what this thing
was<00:02:56.640> meant<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.970> do<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.750> really<00:02:58.500> don't<00:02:58.800> think

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
was meant to do so I really don't think

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.800 
was meant to do so I really don't think
it's<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.430> effective<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.300> weapon<00:03:00.660> but

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
it's that effective on this weapon but

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.390 
it's that effective on this weapon but
