mold and I've pre-mixed my resin and the
first<00:00:18.840> thing<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
first thing I'm going to do is in a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.679 
first thing I'm going to do is in a
little<00:00:20.550> cup<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> bigger

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
little cup and you can do it a bigger

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.689 
little cup and you can do it a bigger
cup<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> doesn't<00:00:22.380> matter<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> pour

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
cup it doesn't matter I'm going to pour

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.589 
cup it doesn't matter I'm going to pour
some<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> resin<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:27.269> I'm<00:00:27.449> going

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
some of the resin in here and I'm going

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.250 
some of the resin in here and I'm going
to<00:00:27.630> add<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:28.800> bit<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.099> gravel<00:00:30.260> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to add some a little bit of gravel you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.870 
to add some a little bit of gravel you
could<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> bigger<00:00:32.070> Cup<00:00:32.369> too<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
could do this in a bigger Cup too if you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.840 
could do this in a bigger Cup too if you
want<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> reason<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.219> doing<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.550> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
want and the reason I'm doing this is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
want and the reason I'm doing this is
I'm<00:00:39.000> hoping<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.840> resin<00:00:40.170> will<00:00:40.320> soak<00:00:40.590> into

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I'm hoping that the resin will soak into

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
I'm hoping that the resin will soak into
the<00:00:41.129> rock<00:00:41.309> seal<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> rocks<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the rock seal the rocks a little bit and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.250 
the rock seal the rocks a little bit and
before<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.710> put<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> mold<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:46.079> with

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
before I put them into the mold and with

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
before I put them into the mold and with
a<00:00:46.289> stir<00:00:46.590> stick<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.640> stir<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a stir stick I'm going to just stir it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
a stir stick I'm going to just stir it
around<00:00:51.469> make<00:00:52.469> sure<00:00:52.620> they're<00:00:52.800> all<00:00:52.949> covered<00:00:53.489> so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
around make sure they're all covered so

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.560 
around make sure they're all covered so
I'm<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> throw<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> see

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
I'm going to throw some in here and see

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
I'm going to throw some in here and see
how<00:00:57.570> much<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> covers<00:01:00.649> kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> spread<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
how much it covers kind of spread it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.479 
how much it covers kind of spread it
around<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:03.080> some<00:01:04.080> bubbles<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.189> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
around and some bubbles actually in this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.320 
around and some bubbles actually in this
particular<00:01:07.430> coaster<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.700> okay<00:01:09.030> because

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
particular coaster would be okay because

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
particular coaster would be okay because
they're<00:01:10.320> underwater<00:01:10.740> fish<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.909> would

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
they're underwater fish so you would

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
they're underwater fish so you would
expect<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.570> bubbles<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
expect to see bubbles but I'm going to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
expect to see bubbles but I'm going to
try<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> thin<00:01:15.479> layer<00:01:15.659> across<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
try to get a thin layer across because I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
try to get a thin layer across because I
don't<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> necessarily<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.270> too

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
don't want this necessarily to be too

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
don't want this necessarily to be too
thick<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.540> coaster<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
thick of a coaster now what I'm going to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
thick of a coaster now what I'm going to
do<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.060> plastic<00:01:24.360> stickers<00:01:25.110> or

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
do I have these plastic stickers or

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.600 
do I have these plastic stickers or
vinyl<00:01:25.590> stickers<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.490> they

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
vinyl stickers I don't know what they

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
vinyl stickers I don't know what they
are<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> seal<00:01:28.200> them<00:01:28.350> ahead

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
are so I'm not going to seal them ahead

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
are so I'm not going to seal them ahead
of<00:01:28.619> time<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.520> don't<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.030> will

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
of time because I don't think there will

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.130 
of time because I don't think there will
be<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.299> problem<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:32.780> first<00:01:33.780> thing<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.020> going

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
be a problem and first thing I'm going

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.130 
be a problem and first thing I'm going
to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> run<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:35.040> lighter<00:01:35.759> over<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.960> rid

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to do is run my lighter over and get rid

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
to do is run my lighter over and get rid
of<00:01:37.170> some<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.829> bubbles<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.939> won't<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.270> rid

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
of some of the bubbles it won't get rid

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.639 
of some of the bubbles it won't get rid
of<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> them<00:01:42.899> probably<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.320> there's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
of all of them probably because there's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.310 
of all of them probably because there's
a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
a lot in there and then I'm going to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.039 
a lot in there and then I'm going to
pick<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:47.399> fish<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> have

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
pick which fish I would like to have

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.210 
pick which fish I would like to have
swimming<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.130> them

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
swimming and I'm going to have them

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
swimming and I'm going to have them
going<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.729> opposite<00:01:51.119> directions<00:01:54.409> if<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.680> have

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
going in opposite directions if we have

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.980 
going in opposite directions if we have
a<00:01:56.189> variety<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.759> colors<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:59.810> think<00:02:00.810> that's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
a variety of colors I think that's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
a variety of colors I think that's
enough<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> remainder<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> my

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
enough so now with the remainder of my

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.410 
enough so now with the remainder of my
resin<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> pour<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> over

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
resin I'm going to pour it over

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.050 
resin I'm going to pour it over
little<00:02:09.420> fishies<00:02:10.670> hopefully<00:02:11.670> it'll<00:02:11.820> cover

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
little fishies hopefully it'll cover

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.630 
little fishies hopefully it'll cover
everything<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.400> big<00:02:14.580> a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
everything if not it's not that big a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.870 
everything if not it's not that big a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.910 
deal
I<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.270> always<00:02:15.450> mix<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.080> little<00:02:16.200> bit<00:02:16.440> more<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
I can always mix a little bit more and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.490 
I can always mix a little bit more and
add<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.150> need<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.170> think

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
add it to it if I need but I think

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.330 
add it to it if I need but I think
hopefully<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.340> will<00:02:20.490> cover<00:02:20.760> everything<00:02:21.200> and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
suggested by Lazydays 2001 I of Y I just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.370 
suggested by Lazydays 2001 I of Y I just
added<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.760> fish<00:02:48.630> stickers<00:02:49.080> because<00:02:49.170> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
added the fish stickers because I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.900 
added the fish stickers because I
thought<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.620> would<00:02:49.950> kind<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.400> give<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.700> fun

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
thought that would kind of give it a fun

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
thought that would kind of give it a fun
look<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.600> I'm<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:51.989> just<00:02:52.140> take<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
look and I'm going to just take the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.670 
look and I'm going to just take the
scissors<00:02:53.630> trim<00:02:54.630> off<00:02:54.840> anything<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.350> might

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
scissors trim off anything that might

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.400 
scissors trim off anything that might
have<00:02:55.800> leaked<00:02:55.980> underneath<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.510> here<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
have leaked underneath so here it is and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.050 
have leaked underneath so here it is and
you<00:02:58.770> can<00:02:58.890> see<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.100> left<00:02:59.340> some<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.730> bubbles

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
you can see I left some of the bubbles

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
you can see I left some of the bubbles
in<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:00.330> figuring<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.020> was<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> fish

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
in there figuring it was like a fish

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.220 
in there figuring it was like a fish
tank<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.090> bubbles<00:03:03.360> are<00:03:03.510> always<00:03:03.720> rising<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
tank so the bubbles are always rising to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.090 
tank so the bubbles are always rising to
the<00:03:04.350> top<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:06.170> again<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.290> was<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> Z<00:03:07.709> cast

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the top and again this was a Z cast

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.670 
the top and again this was a Z cast
resin<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.730> used<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.270> this<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:10.530> worked

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
resin then I used for this and it worked

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.800 
resin then I used for this and it worked
out<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.250> well<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.850> if<00:03:12.239> you're<00:03:12.360> having<00:03:12.600> any
