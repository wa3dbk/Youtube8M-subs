gun<00:00:35.579> i<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.059> reloads<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.840> slow

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
gun i think that reloads a little slow

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
gun i think that reloads a little slow
on<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.489> already<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> got

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
on it but you can already see it's got

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
on it but you can already see it's got

don't<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> problem<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.730> but<00:00:44.730> i

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
don't know what the problem was but i

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
don't know what the problem was but i
think<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.149> wargaming<00:00:45.390> likes<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
think what wargaming likes to do and
I've<00:00:47.160> said<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.670> lot<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.090> times<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.899> newest

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I've said this a lot of times the newest

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.810 
I've said this a lot of times the newest
line<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.950> overpowered<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
line has to be overpowered so that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310 
line has to be overpowered so that
people<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> play<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.809> they'll

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
people will want to play it they'll

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
people will want to play it they'll
spend<00:00:52.620> gold<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.250> credits<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> buy<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
spend gold to get credits to buy the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.900 
spend gold to get credits to buy the
tanks<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.960> free<00:00:55.199> XP<00:00:55.610> that's<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
tanks or to get free XP that's what that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.950 
tanks or to get free XP that's what that
why<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.690> were<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> bunch

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
why they do that if there were a bunch

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.420 
why they do that if there were a bunch
of<00:00:58.050> crap<00:00:58.230> tanks<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:58.920> nobody's<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of crap tanks then nobody's going to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580 
of crap tanks then nobody's going to
spend<00:00:59.640> gold<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.750> get<00:01:00.870> him<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.109> away<00:01:01.199> they'll

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
spend gold to get him right away they'll

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.810 
spend gold to get him right away they'll
just<00:01:01.770> grind<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> old-fashioned<00:01:02.789> way

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
just grind them up the old-fashioned way

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
just grind them up the old-fashioned way
so<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.439> hard<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:04.920> getting

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so it was really hard actually getting

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
so it was really hard actually getting
back<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.689> replay<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.380> hard

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
back to this replay it was really hard

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530 
back to this replay it was really hard
to<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> good<00:01:07.770> replay<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.220> his<00:01:08.310> tank<00:01:08.549> i'm

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
to get a good replay with his tank i'm

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
to get a good replay with his tank i'm
not<00:01:09.659> sure<00:01:09.840> i<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.619> don't<00:01:10.799> know

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
not sure i think was just I don't know

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.300 
not sure i think was just I don't know
why<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.700> sometimes<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.299> takes<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> while<00:01:12.540> uh

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
why just sometimes it takes a while uh

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.140 
why just sometimes it takes a while uh
probably<00:01:14.310> cuz<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> test<00:01:15.000> server

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
probably cuz I was on the test server

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
probably cuz I was on the test server
and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.049> Russian<00:01:16.350> guys<00:01:16.500> play<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> lot

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and then the Russian guys play a lot

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
and then the Russian guys play a lot
differently<00:01:17.670> than<00:01:17.939> any<00:01:18.689> guys<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.049> its<00:01:19.170> own

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
differently than any guys so its own

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.359 
differently than any guys so its own
sometimes<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.650> takes<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> get

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
sometimes it takes a little bit to get

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
sometimes it takes a little bit to get
used<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.670> how<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:20.880> play<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.960> team<00:01:22.500> up

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
used to how they play so you can team up

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.570 
used to how they play so you can team up
with<00:01:22.770> him<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:23.369> being<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
flank a little bit maybe get a back shot

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.960 
flank a little bit maybe get a back shot
on<00:01:27.240> its<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.570> seven<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.369> no<00:01:29.369> dice<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> went<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
on its is seven and no dice it went to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
on its is seven and no dice it went to
the<00:01:30.090> dirt<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:30.900> aim<00:01:30.990> long

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the dirt I think I didn't aim long

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
the dirt I think I didn't aim long
enough<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.680> reload<00:01:32.549> time<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.770> 12<00:01:34.770> seconds

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
enough so reload time on this 12 seconds

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.649 
enough so reload time on this 12 seconds
i<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> say<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:36.030> might<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> little

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
i want to say actually might be a little

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.719 
i want to say actually might be a little
more<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.009> yeah<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.280> least<00:01:38.310> 12

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
more than that yeah that's at least 12

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.770 
more than that yeah that's at least 12
seconds<00:01:39.119> long<00:01:39.960> reloading<00:01:40.530> gun<00:01:40.680> um<00:01:41.600> not<00:01:42.600> my

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
seconds long reloading gun um not my

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
seconds long reloading gun um not my
favorite<00:01:43.229> thing<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> medium<00:01:43.950> cuz<00:01:44.159> usually<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
favorite thing on a medium cuz usually I

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
favorite thing on a medium cuz usually I
like<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.119> shoot<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.899> circling<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
like to shoot a lot if I'm circling a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.539 
like to shoot a lot if I'm circling a
guy<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> don't<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> wait<00:01:47.310> that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
guy I don't want to have to wait that

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.630 
guy I don't want to have to wait that
long<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.820> take<00:01:48.119> him<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.329> um<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.340> know

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
long to take him out um but a you know

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.069 
long to take him out um but a you know
it's<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:51.000> damage<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> kind

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it's got more damage so I guess it kind

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's got more damage so I guess it kind
of<00:01:52.110> evens<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.700> nice<00:01:53.820> pin

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
of evens out it's got really nice pin

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.080 
of evens out it's got really nice pin
though<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.479> medium<00:01:54.899> 440<00:01:55.590> pin<00:01:55.740> our<00:01:55.950> 200<00:01:56.460> wait

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
though for medium 440 pin our 200 wait

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.830 
though for medium 440 pin our 200 wait
what<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> again<00:01:59.390> 268<00:02:00.390> pan<00:02:00.659> that's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
what was it again 268 pan that's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
what was it again 268 pan that's
ridiculous<00:02:01.590> i<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.070> medium<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.490> means

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
ridiculous i think for medium that means

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.429 
ridiculous i think for medium that means
you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.820> shoot<00:02:02.909> people<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> front<00:02:03.540> it's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you can shoot people in the front it's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.440 
you can shoot people in the front it's
got<00:02:04.500> more<00:02:04.799> pin<00:02:05.009> than<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> heavy<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.329> of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
got more pin than the heavy it's kind of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.999 
got more pin than the heavy it's kind of
seems<00:02:06.689> reversed<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.259> seems<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.740> tank

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
seems reversed it seems like this tank

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
seems reversed it seems like this tank
should<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> lower<00:02:08.670> pan<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> 252<00:02:09.539> or

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
should have the lower pan the 252 or

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.469 
should have the lower pan the 252 or
whatever

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
whatever

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.869 
whatever
is<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.470> heavy<00:02:11.650> should<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:11.980> 268<00:02:12.459> just

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
is and the heavy should have a 268 just

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.259 
is and the heavy should have a 268 just
because<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:14.230> again<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.950> seems<00:02:15.730> weird<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
because it again it seems weird that a

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.820 
because it again it seems weird that a
medium<00:02:16.569> would<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.810> more<00:02:16.930> pin<00:02:17.110> than<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.620> heavy

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
medium would have more pin than a heavy

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.130 
medium would have more pin than a heavy
because<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.430> heavy<00:02:18.720> usually<00:02:19.720> has<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.959> fight

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
because a heavy usually has to fight

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.809 
because a heavy usually has to fight
face<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.379> face<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.799> doesn't<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.549> know<00:02:21.580> have

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
face to face it doesn't you know have

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.369 
face to face it doesn't you know have
the<00:02:21.970> mobility<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.599> a<00:02:22.629> medium<00:02:22.930> has<00:02:23.080> although

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
the mobility that a medium has although

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.280 
the mobility that a medium has although
the<00:02:23.950> tier<00:02:24.159> 10<00:02:24.310> mil<00:02:24.760> heavy<00:02:25.450> goes<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.140> same

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the tier 10 mil heavy goes the same

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.600 
the tier 10 mil heavy goes the same
speed<00:02:26.530> existing<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.099> fact<00:02:27.250> maybe<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.519> little

I'm<00:02:37.989> trying<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.620> get<00:02:38.769> around<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.220> flank

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
I'm trying to just get around this flank

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.339 
I'm trying to just get around this flank
so<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.760> don't<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.329> worry<00:02:40.810> about<00:02:40.959> sitting

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
so I don't have to worry about sitting

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.819 
so I don't have to worry about sitting
on<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.560> opening<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:41.950> shot<00:02:42.190> uh<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.709> on

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
on the opening it shot uh so this is on

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.250 
on the opening it shot uh so this is on

I<00:02:47.379> love<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.769> map<00:02:47.950> especially<00:02:48.459> an<00:02:48.519> encounter

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
I love this map especially an encounter

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.380 
I love this map especially an encounter
mode<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:50.500> pretty<00:02:50.709> fun<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.150> one<00:02:52.299> of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
mode it's pretty fun and this is one of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.699 
mode it's pretty fun and this is one of
the<00:02:52.450> first<00:02:52.599> times<00:02:52.810> ever<00:02:52.989> been<00:02:53.290> able<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.470> flank

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
the first times ever been able to flank

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.140 
the first times ever been able to flank
this<00:02:53.890> far<00:02:54.099> up<00:02:54.129> on<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.430> side<00:02:54.579> usually<00:02:54.760> get

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
this far up on the side usually get

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.910 
this far up on the side usually get
spotted<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.660> taken<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.470> they<00:02:56.590> must<00:02:56.739> have

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
spotted and taken out so they must have

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.400

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
shots on guys so not that great but we

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.650 
shots on guys so not that great but we
did<00:04:43.250> route<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.730> whole<00:04:43.910> side<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.210> was<00:04:44.420> kind<00:04:44.630> of

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
did route that whole side I was kind of

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.530 
did route that whole side I was kind of
expecting<00:04:44.870> more<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.920> little<00:04:46.910> more<00:04:47.000> resistance

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
expecting more a little more resistance

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.500 
expecting more a little more resistance
there<00:04:48.020> aight<00:04:48.740> hit<00:04:48.980> points<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.520> 50<00:04:49.850> damn<00:04:50.330> i

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
there aight hit points on that 50 damn i

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.110 
there aight hit points on that 50 damn i
think<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.780> was<00:04:50.960> no<00:04:51.670> that<00:04:52.670> was<00:04:52.760> something<00:04:52.910> else

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
think it was no that was something else

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.720 
think it was no that was something else
that<00:04:53.210> look<00:04:53.390> maybe<00:04:53.540> that's<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.810> tier<00:04:54.020> 9

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
that look maybe that's a tier 9

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.670 
that look maybe that's a tier 9

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
the armors just not there you've got the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.650 
the armors just not there you've got the
mobility<00:05:24.680> you've<00:05:24.830> got<00:05:24.980> the<00:05:25.450> turning<00:05:26.450> speed

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
mobility you've got the turning speed

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.560 
mobility you've got the turning speed
turning<00:05:27.200> radius<00:05:27.760> so<00:05:28.760> just<00:05:29.030> take<00:05:29.240> them<00:05:29.390> out

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
turning radius so just take them out

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.660 
turning radius so just take them out
again<00:05:30.440> we<00:05:30.740> could<00:05:30.890> be<00:05:30.980> capping<00:05:31.340> are<00:05:31.430> here<00:05:31.580> but

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
again we could be capping are here but

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.780 
again we could be capping are here but

the<00:05:34.790> more<00:05:35.000> damage<00:05:35.330> you<00:05:35.540> can<00:05:35.630> get<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.870> more<00:05:36.020> it

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
the more damage you can get the more it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.870 
the more damage you can get the more it
spreads<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.470> out<00:05:36.530> between<00:05:36.710> team<00:05:37.340> members<00:05:37.370> that

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
spreads it out between team members that

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
because the damage you put on the enemy

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.690 
because the damage you put on the enemy
team<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:45.380> spread<00:05:46.010> throughout<00:05:46.370> your<00:05:46.430> whole
