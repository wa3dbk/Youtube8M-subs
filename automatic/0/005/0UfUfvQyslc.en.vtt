00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.020
 the bank 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.180
 or the vice january or if you balcony today 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.550
 josema source and this is daily market 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.029
 the market today lives hand in hand 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.440
 from the dealer group and bring us a couple 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.870
 of chains 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.930
 and when we talk about strings we always 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.029
 we agreed as you see it here 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.750
 mc that distributed it here in our 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.489
 country the dealer curp and provided that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.920
 we are thinking about changing the chain of 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.160
 our transmission we think about something 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.520
 better and what better than each mc first 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.190
 for the second lightness by the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.260
 reliability and third for accuracy 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.030
 of change have come here to the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.570
 writing two models one in silver 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.980
 and another in gold color the weight that has 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.989
 given on the scale is 228 grams that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.330
 can give gram up one gram down 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.590
 this is never accurate but it is always 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:15.640
 around 228 221 grams and we're 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.290
 speaking for a chain that has 5 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.170
 meters and a half in length 114 links 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.440
 and ready for transmissions on 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.530
 all in 11 speed road of 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.460
 11 pine nuts and you see here these recesses that 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.280
 they have are to favor the change of 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.770
 the transmission at the time of uploading and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.800
 lower pine nuts and when changing 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.720
 dishes and to make it to your liking the 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.060
 we have here in the drafting in two 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.930
 colors 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.439
 in gold and titanium color and yes os 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.439
 you fix well 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.079
 for so much lightness comes reduced in 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.720
 each pin comes reduced in its part 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.720
 intermediate in this way we are going to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.840
 save grams to the scale without subtracting 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.120
 an apex of reliability in the transmission 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.030
 and these have been the chains here mc 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.830
 that distributes kurpil in our country and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.989
 we have been researching deepening in 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.519
 your website and there has been a product that to me 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.519
 I have personally been captivated 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 a vintage retro style standing bomb 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.540
 whatever you want to call it the ring brand 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.450
 with all the body in aluminum that goes 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.520
 to give greater robustness and precision to the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.480
 time to pump and inflate 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.170
 with manometer with both indicative 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 in bars like in psi 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 then you can put it on the valve 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.849
 lends what is the narrow or the ryder 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.849
 the fat simply with this movement 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.150
 we turn it around 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.510
 very simple according 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.510
 unscrews mos 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.590
 and we screw 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.230
 we put in and fix it and pump 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.740
 to fix the rubber and that is not loose 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.210
 on the floor 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.230
 unforeseeable footsteps as it comes with a 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.260
 accessory to be able to fix it and then the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.989
 Now pumping handle is made of wood 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.060
 it was a really nice touch and that 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.370
 retro style that we liked 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.069
 has an aluminum base that goes to 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.650
 provide more weight as not in the 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.480
 base worth the redundancy in this way 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.450
 will give us stability and at the time of 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.360
 be able to tread the power to exercise the greatest 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.510
 possible strength when pumping and 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.090
 Give warmth to this precious big pump 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.610
 Inflation capacity also without 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.370
 too much effort and if we go over to the 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.110
 time to inflate others because it has this 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.860
 small valve that simply 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.860
 squeezing it 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.480
 we are going to be able to put the 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.480
 pressure that we find deciding 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.360
 good vice onerous liners this has 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.300
 been the market to this day has come 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.440
 from the hand of useful and good news in 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.350
 exclusive for you 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.890
 josema source and see you in a next
