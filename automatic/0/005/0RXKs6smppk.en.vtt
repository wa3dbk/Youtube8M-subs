in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> sheet<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> helps<00:00:41.100> keep<00:00:41.219> down<00:00:41.399> sound

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in the sheet that helps keep down sound

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
in the sheet that helps keep down sound
a<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.210> longer<00:00:42.390> cutting<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.920> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
a little bit longer cutting them out and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310 
a little bit longer cutting them out and
then<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> glue<00:00:45.030> stick<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:46.050> put<00:00:46.260> the

snugly together and the crank shaft will
go<00:01:03.359> through<00:01:03.570> those<00:01:03.719> holes<00:01:04.250> as<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
go through those holes as you can see on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310 
go through those holes as you can see on
the<00:01:05.970> pattern<00:01:06.330> there's<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.689> lines<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the pattern there's some lines that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.660 
the pattern there's some lines that
we're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> crease<00:01:08.159> later<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
we're going to crease later with a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
we're going to crease later with a
chisel<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:10.350> help<00:01:11.659> perform<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> bends<00:01:16.310> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
chisel to help perform the bends that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
chisel to help perform the bends that
some<00:01:17.549> pieces<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.060> bending<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:19.320> will

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
some pieces will be bending up some will

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.370 
some pieces will be bending up some will
be<00:01:19.619> bending<00:01:19.920> down<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> piston<00:01:21.900> will<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.140> there

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
be bending down the piston will go there

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.700 
be bending down the piston will go there
and<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.180> displacer<00:01:25.080> shaft<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.530> come

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and the displacer shaft will come

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
and the displacer shaft will come
through<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> drill

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
through right here so we have to drill

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.990 
through right here so we have to drill
that<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.960> well<00:01:29.479> alright<00:01:31.610> most<00:01:32.610> part<00:01:32.850> we're

going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> drill<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> holes<00:01:34.159> with<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
going to drill out the holes with this

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.310 
going to drill out the holes with this
1/16<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:38.900> we'll<00:01:39.900> even<00:01:40.079> will<00:01:40.470> pre-drill<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
1/16 bit we'll even will pre-drill the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
1/16 bit we'll even will pre-drill the
crankshaft<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> 1/8<00:01:44.280> inch<00:01:44.600> with<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.720> as

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.550 
trouble also it's very hard to pivot it
I<00:03:29.000> might<00:03:29.239> try<00:03:29.420> something<00:03:29.720> different<00:03:30.230> for<00:03:30.409> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
I might try something different for the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.319 
I might try something different for the
vacuum<00:03:31.099> next<00:03:31.489> time<00:03:31.609> I<00:03:31.700> cut<00:03:31.909> something<00:03:32.150> out

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
vacuum next time I cut something out

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.809 
vacuum next time I cut something out
like<00:03:32.569> this<00:03:32.810> it's<00:03:33.769> hard<00:03:34.069> to<00:03:34.220> grip<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.609> too

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
like this it's hard to grip it too

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.129 
like this it's hard to grip it too
because<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.359> so<00:03:35.480> flat

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
because it's so flat

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.580 
because it's so flat
maybe<00:03:37.010> gluing<00:03:37.849> something<00:03:38.239> on<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.690> hold<00:03:39.109> on<00:03:39.319> to

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
maybe gluing something on to hold on to

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.039 
maybe gluing something on to hold on to
might<00:03:39.950> help<00:03:40.840> anyway

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
might help anyway

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.470 
might help anyway
it's<00:03:42.920> some<00:03:43.069> time<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.430> effort<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:44.120> can<00:03:44.299> get

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
it's some time and effort you can get

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.539 
it's some time and effort you can get
that<00:03:44.629> cut<00:03:44.810> out<00:03:44.900> pretty<00:03:45.139> good<00:03:45.290> alright<00:03:46.069> for<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
that cut out pretty good alright for the

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.149 
that cut out pretty good alright for the
bottom<00:03:48.459> sided<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.670> attach<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.569> board

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
bottom sided to attach it to a board

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.250 
bottom sided to attach it to a board
because<00:03:52.159> I<00:03:52.340> had<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.549> lot<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.970> trouble<00:03:53.329> actually

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
because I had a lot of trouble actually

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.020 
because I had a lot of trouble actually
holding<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.159> gripping<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.730> cut<00:03:55.909> out

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
holding it and gripping it to cut out

holding it and gripping it to cut out
the<00:03:56.209> top<00:03:56.389> piece<00:03:56.980> came<00:03:57.980> out<00:03:58.159> pretty<00:03:58.939> good<00:03:59.209> at

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
the top piece came out pretty good at

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.509 
the top piece came out pretty good at
all<00:03:59.510> but<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.989> think<00:04:00.739> this<00:04:01.040> will<00:04:01.190> work<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.400> lot

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
all but I think this will work a lot

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.240 
all but I think this will work a lot
easier<00:04:01.970> I've<00:04:02.569> already<00:04:02.870> cut<00:04:03.049> out<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.470> fan

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
easier I've already cut out the fan

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.710 
easier I've already cut out the fan
flywheel<00:04:05.150> portion<00:04:05.629> of<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.949> engine<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:08.569> I'll

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
flywheel portion of the engine and I'll

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.580 
flywheel portion of the engine and I'll
cover<00:04:09.489> like<00:04:10.489> flywheel<00:04:11.419> and<00:04:11.720> fan<00:04:11.989> construction

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590

in a different video
I<00:04:14.319> drilled<00:04:15.319> out<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.500> holes<00:04:15.799> actually<00:04:16.400> went<00:04:17.060> a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
I drilled out the holes actually went a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.729 
I drilled out the holes actually went a
lot<00:04:17.209> easier<00:04:17.570> with<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.019> board<00:04:18.229> don't

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
lot easier with it on the board don't

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.199 
lot easier with it on the board don't
have<00:04:18.949> to<00:04:19.010> clear<00:04:19.220> off<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.459> little<00:04:19.669> birds<00:04:20.000> on

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
have to clear off the little birds on

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.810 
have to clear off the little birds on
the<00:04:20.269> bottom<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.810> won't<00:04:20.989> catch<00:04:21.139> on<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.440> saw

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
the bottom so it won't catch on the saw

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:46.050 
the bottom so it won't catch on the saw
there<00:04:22.820> should<00:04:23.000> go<00:04:23.150> much<00:04:23.330> easier

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.950 

that<00:04:47.050> one<00:04:47.200> much<00:04:47.440> easier<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.690> probably<00:04:49.690> will<00:04:49.840> do

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
that one much easier I probably will do

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.990 
that one much easier I probably will do

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
very good support if I was doing finer

details it would have kept it from
bending<00:04:58.990> over<00:04:59.350> it<00:05:00.010> would<00:05:00.160> have<00:05:00.250> been<00:05:00.340> very
