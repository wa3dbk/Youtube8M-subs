00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:13.289
 Increasing number of non-university academics in Japan This should also be considered seriously and this is for the future of Japan 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:15.599
 It's the Tteyuu foreign students to American colleges and universities is on the decline in recent years in fact from Japan I 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 It is already cheaper yen on the altar 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.460
 That 's why so many numbers from the prefecture are coming This is the story I heard yesterday Yesterday 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.590
 Now carnegie 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.009
 The Vice-President of Japan , I heard that I was also waiting for the Empathy Chief and the Assembly Hall together 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.559
 so 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.269
 Many are single species from China than the number from the melon is an amazing pen main flower main to this year's new students spring 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.650
 It's a university in the acquisition 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:44.410
 1 person full name whopping from Japan and from China with 120 people 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:50.230
 The top of the game is China India Korea , so Japan is also out of the rankings at all 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.340
 This means that one way of thinking is not necessary because the university in Japan is far away 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.170
 Is not there 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.640
 I'm looking for that's because there are few students studying in the US because the level of Japanese university is high 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.360
 It's not because I have no need to say 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.170
 This is a look at the ranking of that kind of science 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.260
 Then the UK's ranking is a bit higher for technical schools 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.270
 Are you the Well but the American is you might have people saying that spray 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 If you are a student of the whole engineering department, you can say that there is a university along the way 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:25.300
 That mine or Negimeron is than I unfortunately 12 thing is are specializing in when I copy 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:29.560
 That's the whole part just I have fallen about 10 people Japan's Tokyo University or such as # 27 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:36.160
 Seoul is No. 29 in Kyoto and 39th in Kyoto University 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.270
 Japanese universities are in the 100th place that Tokyo Institute of Technology only has 58 Eastern universities 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.570
 There is no 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.200
 Kana pass examination in particular that it is not even entered the top 100 Oite Te are so umbrella 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:49.939
 Japanese go to America because the rank of Japanese university is high 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.119
 It doesn't make sense to say that it doesn't mean that , especially in that particular subject 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.890
 This is a front side miso, but for example, it is the world ranking of computer service 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:01.880
 Carnegie Mellon has because 123 of let me all the time poison the overwhelmingly soy milk 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.190
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Stanford Cusco almost always in rankings 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.190
 I'm taking the same position, so this side is the same, but it's that wise 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.610
 I will only use the bathtub of Harvard uc bank 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.690
 Another Kyoto Osaka Tokyo Institute of Technology is nearly 100 50 This is 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.370
 Another Nde a large number in the fact that about between this but I do not gave us the rank of incorrect answers 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:25.180
 11 I do not I something contains the Kyoto Osaka Tokyo Institute of Technology University of Tokyo in 100 of rank from o'clock 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:30.579
 That is why Japanese universities are now within the top 100 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 It is only a reference, and the damage is not included at all, and also two right Keio Waseda is quite after 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.849
 I think Akbar 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.640
 However, in terms of ranking, Japan is not included in the top 10 in the world 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.000
 A level say and probably the university between the stop of Japan 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.900
 so 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.340
 I think that I maintain the level outside the brain but I think 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:53.590
 That I only be carried out Japanese universities as Sae incense Negimeron point of contact at all so far talk 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:58.480
 I think that I do not really come from that kind of thing I think that Japan 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.990
 I think that you should think about the fact that most universities were ranked 100th in the world ranking love seriously 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.090
 First of all is simple 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.990
 What do you are going to raise seriously the really distant quality positioned as for the university job 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.670
 It is a thing 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.770
 The second is a wow graduation Mon simple where students do not study because it does not study 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.900
 The quality of the university does not go up 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.650
 And even if there is a student who wants to study by any chance, in the environment of Japanese university, the world is beaten 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.010
 Can not 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.030
 At first each specialty 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:29.010
 I do not have most of Japan Te Bachelor's degree of the top schools in the field of world 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.079
 If this is the case, the education level in Japan will be delayed more and more in the world, including science and engineering 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.750
 Under the current circumstances, students who want to study seriously in that sense should go to America or England 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:43.300
 That makes me a terrific simple conclusion 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.830
 Most in practice when it comes to should aim song's universities in the world ranking in the top 100 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.170
 Become an American university 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:54.400
 If the top ten levels of each field in the world are not increased in Japan, it will not increase in Japan. 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.740
 If you are going to be a tough thing for the future, you should simply go home to an American university 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.150
 If you want to receive the Japanese also act and say sugar 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.350
 Let's take it in Japan 56 times a year with 2 weeks of exams 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:11.780
 It says gpa, but simply speaking Japanese high school grades from the US 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:17.209
 It is a story that you only need to change the spice after warming to the gon stage in the point system 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.760
 Especially after the 3rd year's score is important, I have received toefl but this 3 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.710
 Most 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:27.090
 The exam is over, but if it is an essay at some university, it is a spoon as an extracurricular activity 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.980
 Prying One but I sometimes I especially important are or Toka little interview testimonial 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:36.510
 Simply put, it says that anyone in the US can receive it while staying in Japan . 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.750
 I think that I want you to aim for the top 10 in the world if you try anyway 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.060
 It was Tokyo 27 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:46.860
 No Do not collecting or it's a pretty sad reality 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:51.000
 I'd heard where there Well I this is here not only whether you root of my rumor 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.389
 Sophia University I 'm sorry, but if you are in university at all times , you might gather excellent people 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.320
 Ibm the Sophia University 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:02.099
 It 's not all about the game world ibm has already partnered with a long- time card 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.169
 By summer vacation 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:11.020
 Excellent freshman so I'd heard would go with One check out all 10 people all 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.789
 Say I I I do not know whether that really super or sophia university 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.969
 "I 'm going to the United States Europe of the original inter nasa school 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:22.070
 University of many Japanese people with sophia university 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:26.210
 It is a well-known than the famous National University of such a partner 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:30.140
 Even if it is a game or a big part, its presence is high. 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.860
 What is a good school? Let me tell you about the label 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:38.270
 google apple And inside the campus there was no such thing 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.890
 Because they have a research institute at the top school Noah's positioning 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.060
 I think you want to think 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.300
 I want to do that to shochu course 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.930
 ibm and Do not wonder if Kedomo is not it at all even if doing something strange 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:54.260
 Thank you for your time 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.260
 Well, I was surprised I found about 200 retired .
