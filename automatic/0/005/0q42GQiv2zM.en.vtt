00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.450
 or both of us and we are here in dragon city 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.340
 and that distracted the first video of 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.290
 rest of Hawaiian have finally followed the 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.179
 island water and adra with it and I'm going to 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.150
 teach how to get the habit of 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.490
 Hawaii to get into this island 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.769
 you just have to come here to 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.679
 your our island and in the center 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.359
 you will find the waters or if not 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.789
 you can hit the right where you put the 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.189
 water and five days if you give it there 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.529
 put in here if this event does not come out in 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.169
 your dragon city is because you have already 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.879
 finished since it lasts five days and has 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.879
 started on July 24 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.120
 that is, those who are only on mobile 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.380
 at the moment not served in pc but not 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.980
 it means that it will not go out in pc 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.690
 instead of open the other event you could 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.580
 say the same but maybe also 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.160
 a couple of things but the dragons and the 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.690
 habitat that goes nothing will be the same 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.820
 that the same thing helps us for the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.910
 pc I hope you know that later 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.290
 it will be good, we will start and we will 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.180
 this screen will come out 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.280
 to get the hawaii habitat that is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 the one you see here that by the way has a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.120
 maximum of 13 Aragon and accumulated maximum 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 60,000 gold we will have to buy 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.630
 break all the blocks to break the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.690
 first row of blocks we will have to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 turn off 585 1800 gold per block 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.080
 this depends on our levels if 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 we are more levels in dragon city 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.550
 we will have to pay more gold in my case 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.060
 I have to pay this amount for being 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.200
 level 21 so well let's break 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.240
 the blocks 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.369
 and we go to the next row 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.619
 in which surfboards come out and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.540
 it gets get fighting good to get 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.189
 these surfboards what will we have 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.580
 what to do is go combat maps and 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.950
 to struggle 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.680
 the combat magician in the world of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.920
 combat what we will have to do is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.170
 give him a fight with forgiveness and channel 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.940
 I find that we win it will give us a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.780
 surfboard we will need two for 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 break each block 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.140
 well, as you can see, it's going a little slow 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.080
 because I'm so 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.080
 of mille because if it's fire the other 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.500
 well it seems that they have changed again 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.390
 the order of the elements of a dragon 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.130
 city ​​before I left 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.360
 the main element on the right and 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 now they have changed it back to the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.830
 left as I was a while ago 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.239
 and well the fight is going to end already and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
 Now we will see that once the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.400
 combat if we manage to remember that if only 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.530
 you win it jce they will give you a table of 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.420
 surfing there has been seen more one is worth with 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.879
 we can break these blocks 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.370
 although I need another one because they are from 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.489
 two each block then we will have to 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.439
 win six fights and the next 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.780
 block you have to break as you see there are 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.060
 four in total four masks that 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.980
 will get when you win a fight 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.420
 against a specific dragon like 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.709
 surely you do not know what the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.239
 dragons that are going to come out because it's that 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.739
 there is no way to know you 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.250
 I will put the dragons right now in 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.250
 screen 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.250
 I guess now I know watching 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.420
 now I will put it with him sing if he has 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.730
 edited vale 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.319
 and what I have put is the picture of the dragon 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.150
 what are you going to have against which you are going to 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.060
 have to fight the elements that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.370
 you should use 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.860
 and the combat number from the order 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.510
 in what order will you come out there are four 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.330
 combats in total there are the 40 goals 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.430
 that will come out later will ask 5 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.750
 you fight more but when you do the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.760
 video, you will see it but of all 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.020
 forms I put a page in the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650
 description if you want to see 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.870
 directly that fights are the five 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.099
 following because if I do not do the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.510
 video since I'm in a account 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.260
 low level and many times it does not give me 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.470
 time to get fast events and 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.080
 well I will do the first fight in 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.769
 that the father watches the noises he makes 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.060
 the dice the first fight will be with the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.340
 dragonfly dragon and the elements that 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.290
 they put that we should use are ice and 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.370
 land in this case to use a dragon 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.639
 event since it has the earth element 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.590
 there is lake dragonfly 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.590
 we use asteroid that is ground 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.280
 and ready this is the easiest way 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.410
 win the matches because if we choose a 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.660
 dragon of very high level the other also 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.940
 will have in the same life and level as the 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.080
 yours so to win you the only 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.460
 what you have to do is make him critical 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.280
 you can even win with a dragon of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.600
 level 5 and as you can see find 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.430
 a mask you can break the block and 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.750
 there are three remaining that are the three 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.120
 dragons that I also put earlier in 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.160
 in the image so nothing with this 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.320
 you can perfectly pass the twine 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.750
 jahuel the truth quite easy this 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.520
 new event or at least the first 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.350
 stage although it is also true that it is a 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.650
 put very little time because five days 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.210
 almost six sometimes it's not enough to 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.830
 pass it on in the entire event but for 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.780
 at least the view I think that anyone 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.190
 I could get it so I do not expect anything 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.450
 that the video has been useful to you if 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.400
 you have any doubt put it in the 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.260
 comments or interest try to help and 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.260
 nothing see you next video goodbye
