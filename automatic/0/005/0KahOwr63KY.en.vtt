00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
grid for this grid open up that grid the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.359 
grid for this grid open up that grid the
wrong<00:01:48.119> grid<00:01:48.360> guys<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.020> wrong<00:01:49.170> grid<00:01:49.440> that's

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
wrong grid guys the wrong grid that's

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.430 
wrong grid guys the wrong grid that's
the<00:01:50.550> greater<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> you're<00:01:52.080> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> find

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
the greater one so you're going to find

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.109 
the greater one so you're going to find
where<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> sensor<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.640> Center

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
where the sensor is I'm going to Center

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.370 
where the sensor is I'm going to Center
it<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:55.020> positions<00:01:55.800> move<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:56.430> they're<00:01:57.380> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it and positions move that they're so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
it and positions move that they're so
then<00:01:59.040> we're<00:01:59.160> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> find<00:01:59.550> where<00:01:59.700> our

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
then we're going to find where our

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.609 
then we're going to find where our
second<00:02:00.180> word<00:02:00.300> is<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:00.899> hello<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.500> we're

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
second word is and that's hello so we're

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.480 
second word is and that's hello so we're
going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.800> move<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.190> down<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.850> position<00:02:04.490> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
going to move it down our position like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.410 
going to move it down our position like
so<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.869> hello<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.320> centered<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.179> we're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so so the hello is centered and we're

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.820 
so so the hello is centered and we're
going<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.630> position<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.440> over<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.679> so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
going to position it a bit over there so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.410 
going to position it a bit over there so
make<00:02:10.979> sure<00:02:11.009> your<00:02:11.250> key<00:02:11.430> framing<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.970> slice<00:02:12.270> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
make sure your key framing this slice it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.180 
make sure your key framing this slice it
look<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> bit<00:02:12.660> dodgy<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.560> can<00:02:13.650> see<00:02:13.830> say

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
look a bit dodgy so as you can see say

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.420 
look a bit dodgy so as you can see say
hello<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:16.290> fine<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> next<00:02:17.190> row<00:02:17.340> which

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
hello then fine go to the next row which

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.759 
hello then fine go to the next row which
is<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.660> one's<00:02:18.840> rotated<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.650> I'm

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
is two and that one's rotated so I'm

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.380 
is two and that one's rotated so I'm
going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.160> I'm<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.459> go<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.640> Zed

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
going to do is I'm going to go to Zed

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.500 
going to do is I'm going to go to Zed
rotation<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.850> keyframe<00:02:24.150> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
rotation and then going to keyframe that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.259 
rotation and then going to keyframe that
bit<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.080> well<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.910> we're<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.180> to

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
bit there as well so we're going to

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.680 
bit there as well so we're going to
keyframe<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.260> rotation<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.299> I'm<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.600> I'm

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
keyframe the rotation and I'm so I'm

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.600 
keyframe the rotation and I'm so I'm
going<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.870> spin<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.170> round<00:02:31.290> minus<00:02:31.980> 90<00:02:32.310> degrees

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
going to spin it round minus 90 degrees

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.860 
going to spin it round minus 90 degrees
or<00:02:32.850> something<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.299> i<00:02:33.450> think<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.840> is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
or something like that i think it is

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.170 
or something like that i think it is
minus<00:02:34.200> 90<00:02:34.560> now<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.549> plus<00:02:35.790> 90<00:02:36.150> degrees<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
minus 90 now it's plus 90 degrees and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
minus 90 now it's plus 90 degrees and
i'm<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.480> send<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.410> position<00:02:42.950> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
i'm going to send to that a position to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.370 
i'm going to send to that a position to
i'm<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.820> zoom<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.390> little<00:02:45.540> bit<00:02:47.630> them<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
i'm a zoom in a little bit them and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.070 
i'm a zoom in a little bit them and
bring<00:02:49.709> out<00:02:49.890> my<00:02:50.070> position<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.700> bit<00:02:50.880> more

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bring out my position a bit more

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.420 
bring out my position a bit more
something<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.709> want<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> center<00:02:53.280> each

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
something so you just want a center each

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.789 
something so you just want a center each
word<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.940> rotate<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.110> added<00:02:55.350> rotation

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
word and rotate it if you added rotation

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.530 
word and rotate it if you added rotation
first<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.850> want<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> do<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.299> want<00:02:57.330> to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
first what I want to do is I want to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.360 
first what I want to do is I want to
make<00:02:57.690> sure<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.140> black<00:02:58.410> solid<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> bit

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
make sure that this black solid is a bit

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.640 
make sure that this black solid is a bit
bigger<00:02:59.700> because<00:03:00.230> otherwise<00:03:01.230> we're<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
bigger because otherwise we're going to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.520 
bigger because otherwise we're going to
be<00:03:01.769> getting<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:03.510> black<00:03:03.720> solid<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.380> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
be getting the black solid is going to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.289 
be getting the black solid is going to
disappear<00:03:04.890> we<00:03:05.250> live<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:05.549> blank<00:03:05.820> bit<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.209> the

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
disappear we live like blank bit on the

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.270 
disappear we live like blank bit on the
screen<00:03:06.570> where<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> black<00:03:07.560> solid<00:03:07.769> hasn't<00:03:08.130> fit

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
screen where the black solid hasn't fit

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.250 
screen where the black solid hasn't fit
on<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.330> can<00:03:09.390> see<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.690> far<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:10.110> we've

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
on so as you can see so far what we've

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.319 
on so as you can see so far what we've
got<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.739> we<00:03:11.310> should<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.549> animated<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.090> first

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
got is we should have animated the first

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.130 
got is we should have animated the first
base<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.870> say<00:03:13.560> hello<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.480> then<00:03:16.049> we're

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
base so say hello to and then we're

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.630 
base so say hello to and then we're
going<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.320> find<00:03:16.470> where<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.680> comms<00:03:17.220> image<00:03:17.519> is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
going to find where my comms image is

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.670 
going to find where my comms image is
there<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.120> then<00:03:18.959> we're<00:03:19.140> going<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.320> go<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.470> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
there and then we're going to go to this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
there and then we're going to go to this
position<00:03:20.040> again<00:03:20.489> now<00:03:21.090> we're<00:03:21.239> going<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.420> get<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
position again now we're going to get a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.270 
position again now we're going to get a
rotation<00:03:22.049> first<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:22.590> easiest<00:03:22.890> I'm

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
rotation first like that's easiest I'm

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.880 
rotation first like that's easiest I'm
just<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.580> change<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.880> back<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.000> zero<00:03:24.890> so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
just going to change it back to zero so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.490 
just going to change it back to zero so
we're<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.220> normal<00:03:26.580> again<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:27.209> then<00:03:27.360> my

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
we're back to normal again and then my

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.950 
we're back to normal again and then my
a<00:03:29.060> position<00:03:30.060> we're<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.510> move<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.810> off<00:03:30.930> a

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
a position we're going to move it off a

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.060

looks a bit silly and it's quite hard to

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.310 
looks a bit silly and it's quite hard to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
sure that it's all in proportion like

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.250 
sure that it's all in proportion like
that<00:03:54.150> looks<00:03:54.300> all<00:03:54.510> right<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.959> moment<00:03:55.050> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that looks all right at the moment I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.720 
that looks all right at the moment I
might<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.709> adjust<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:56.130> at<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> end<00:03:56.370> see

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
might have to adjust it at the end see

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.370 
might have to adjust it at the end see
how<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.910> looks<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.600> now<00:03:57.720> we've<00:03:57.900> got<00:03:58.020> little

little and then friend comes in at the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.310 
little and then friend comes in at the
bottom<00:04:17.700> here<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.209> I'm<00:04:18.540> just<00:04:18.989> going<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.169> zoom

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
bottom here so I'm just going to zoom

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.960 
bottom here so I'm just going to zoom
that<00:04:19.500> out<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> bit<00:04:19.859> more<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.160> friend<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.820> I'm

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
that out a bit more for friend and I'm

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.330 
that out a bit more for friend and I'm
going<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.209> rotate<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.530> minus<00:04:23.520> 90<00:04:24.060> degrees<00:04:25.340> like

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
going to rotate it minus 90 degrees like

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.170 
going to rotate it minus 90 degrees like
that<00:04:27.740> that's<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.860> bit<00:04:29.010> off<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.520> 90<00:04:30.060> ow<00:04:31.820> minus<00:04:32.820> 90

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
that that's a bit off so 90 ow minus 90

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.180 
that that's a bit off so 90 ow minus 90
amount<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.600> then<00:04:34.410> we're<00:04:34.560> going<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.710> Center<00:04:35.160> it

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
amount and then we're going to Center it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.820 
amount and then we're going to Center it
and<00:04:35.880> as<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.300> said<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.690> it's<00:04:36.930> pretty<00:04:37.410> easy<00:04:37.590> once

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
and as I said it's it's pretty easy once

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.740 
and as I said it's it's pretty easy once
you<00:04:38.040> get<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.190> hang<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.640> just<00:04:38.910> takes<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.720> bit

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
you get the hang of it just takes a bit

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.330 
you get the hang of it just takes a bit
of<00:04:39.870> time<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.320> want<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.500> spend<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.919> bit<00:04:41.190> of<00:04:41.220> time

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
of time you want to spend a bit of time

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.100 
of time you want to spend a bit of time
on<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.640> obviously<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.300> say<00:04:42.510> hello<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.840> my

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
on it obviously so say hello to my

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.450 
on it obviously so say hello to my
little<00:04:43.470> friend<00:04:44.400> there<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:45.810> go<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.460> probably

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
little friend there you go I probably

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.580 
little friend there you go I probably
wouldn't<00:04:48.060> have<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.600> now<00:04:49.140> i<00:04:49.169> think<00:04:49.260> was<00:04:49.470> it

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
wouldn't have it that now i think was it

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.980 
wouldn't have it that now i think was it
that<00:04:49.710> too<00:04:49.979> looks<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.910> bit<00:04:51.030> dodgy<00:04:51.240> way<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.780> deal

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
that too looks a bit dodgy way and deal

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
that too looks a bit dodgy way and deal
the<00:04:52.200> word<00:04:53.070> is<00:04:53.310> there<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.620> like<00:04:55.620> if<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:55.860> get

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
the word is there and like if you get

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.300 
the word is there and like if you get
what<00:04:56.100> I'm<00:04:56.190> saying<00:04:56.370> but<00:04:56.580> actually<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.120> word

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
what I'm saying but actually that word

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.640 
what I'm saying but actually that word
shouldn't<00:04:59.419> bother<00:05:00.419> them<00:05:00.660> right<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.200> want<00:05:01.560> that

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
on 0 so you want to make sure you key

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.430 
on 0 so you want to make sure you key
frame<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.450> for<00:05:06.479> every<00:05:06.810> word<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:09.440> wanted

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
frame it for every word and wanted

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.290 
frame it for every word and wanted
keyframe<00:05:11.130> my<00:05:11.340> scale<00:05:11.700> actually<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:15.120> make

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300
