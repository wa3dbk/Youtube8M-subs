00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hello youtube i heard i just got a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.220 
hello youtube i heard i just got a
Western<00:00:02.730> Germans<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.629> few<00:00:03.899> months<00:00:04.110> ago

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
Western Germans about a few months ago

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.130 
Western Germans about a few months ago
and<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.680> just<00:00:04.859> wanted<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.240> see<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.509> water<00:00:06.870> tight

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
and I just wanted to see how water tight

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.110 
and I just wanted to see how water tight
end<00:00:07.440> therefore<00:00:07.950> sound<00:00:08.189> tight<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.639> UM<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:08.970> was

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
end therefore sound tight the UM one was

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.640 
end therefore sound tight the UM one was
so<00:00:09.420> here's<00:00:09.599> my<00:00:09.660> test

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.380 

so<00:00:15.650> my<00:00:15.800> initial<00:00:15.980> test<00:00:16.370> was<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.670> see<00:00:16.700> if<00:00:17.060> the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
so my initial test was to see if the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.020 
so my initial test was to see if the
water<00:00:17.600> does<00:00:17.840> gets<00:00:18.110> her<00:00:18.260> around<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.830> casing<00:00:19.310> so

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
water does gets her around the casing so

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.820 
water does gets her around the casing so
to<00:00:20.180> do<00:00:20.360> this<00:00:20.390> I<00:00:20.720> actually<00:00:20.870> put<00:00:21.170> a<00:00:21.200> blue<00:00:21.410> tag<00:00:21.620> a

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
to do this I actually put a blue tag a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.030 
to do this I actually put a blue tag a
sealant<00:00:22.400> around<00:00:22.520> the<00:00:22.910> nozzle<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.410> then<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.619> put

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
sealant around the nozzle and then I put

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.620 
sealant around the nozzle and then I put
it<00:00:25.100> on<00:00:25.190> the<00:00:25.310> water<00:00:25.490> for<00:00:25.730> about<00:00:25.820> 10<00:00:26.180> minutes<00:00:26.360> and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
it on the water for about 10 minutes and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.930 
it on the water for about 10 minutes and
I<00:00:27.230> connected<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.770> my<00:00:27.860> arm<00:00:28.220> h2o<00:00:28.610> do

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
I connected it to my arm h2o do

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.380 
I connected it to my arm h2o do
amphibian<00:00:29.660> case<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:31.490> music<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.090> playing

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
amphibian case and the music is playing

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.410 
amphibian case and the music is playing
through<00:00:32.629> the<00:00:33.400> DCM<00:00:34.400> on<00:00:34.520> right<00:00:34.820> now<00:00:40.270> so<00:00:41.270> after

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
through the DCM on right now so after

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.270 
through the DCM on right now so after
about<00:00:41.600> two<00:00:42.020> minutes<00:00:42.199> I<00:00:42.410> pulled<00:00:42.710> one<00:00:42.860> out<00:00:42.890> to

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
about two minutes I pulled one out to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.770 
about two minutes I pulled one out to
see<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:43.699> still<00:00:43.790> working<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.420> let's<00:00:44.570> hear

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
see if it's still working so let's hear

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:55.509 
see if it's still working so let's hear
it<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.320> hear<00:00:54.470> yourselves<00:00:54.830> useful<00:00:55.070> coming

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
it you can hear yourselves useful coming

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.189 
it you can hear yourselves useful coming
up<00:00:55.610> as<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.210> can<00:00:56.360> hear<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:56.750> not<00:00:56.900> terribly

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
up as you can hear it's not terribly

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.910 
up as you can hear it's not terribly
clear<00:00:57.530> sound<00:00:57.890> but<00:00:58.870> you<00:00:59.870> get<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.019> point<00:01:00.290> and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
clear sound but you get the point and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.350 
clear sound but you get the point and
this<00:01:01.159> is<00:01:01.280> after<00:01:01.400> 30<00:01:01.640> minutes<00:01:01.909> same<00:01:02.180> thing

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
this is after 30 minutes same thing

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:14.969 
this is after 30 minutes same thing
again

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.819 

you<00:01:15.979> can<00:01:16.189> see<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:17.420> can<00:01:17.719> hear<00:01:18.140> it's

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829

it<00:01:20.450> works<00:01:20.659> fine<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.860> after<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:22.399> I<00:01:22.610> try<00:01:22.939> this

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
it works fine so after this I try this

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.059 
it works fine so after this I try this
in<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.570> shower<00:01:23.840> with<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.259> triple<00:01:24.619> flange<00:01:24.860> tip

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
in the shower with a triple flange tip

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.179 
in the shower with a triple flange tip
and<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.969> worked<00:01:26.210> quite<00:01:26.420> well<00:01:26.479> actually<00:01:27.189> but

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
and it worked quite well actually but

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.179 
and it worked quite well actually but
after<00:01:28.520> close<00:01:29.479> inspection<00:01:29.719> I<00:01:30.170> realized<00:01:30.679> not<00:01:31.130> i

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
after close inspection I realized not i

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.190 
after close inspection I realized not i
realize<00:01:31.579> i<00:01:31.759> saw<00:01:32.119> there<00:01:32.450> was<00:01:32.539> a<00:01:32.600> condensation

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
realize i saw there was a condensation

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.719 
realize i saw there was a condensation
formed<00:01:33.619> inside<00:01:33.939> so<00:01:34.939> as<00:01:35.810> we<00:01:36.350> all<00:01:36.530> expected<00:01:37.130> um

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
formed inside so as we all expected um

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.830 
formed inside so as we all expected um
one<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.119> not<00:01:39.280> very<00:01:40.280> watertight<00:01:40.880> although<00:01:41.659> it's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
one is not very watertight although it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.600 
one is not very watertight although it's
so<00:01:42.079> old<00:01:42.289> design<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.009> could<00:01:43.159> take<00:01:43.369> some

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
so old design that it could take some

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.080 
so old design that it could take some
time<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.119> water<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.659> still<00:01:45.140> works<00:01:45.470> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
time on the water and still works and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.160 
time on the water and still works and
even<00:01:47.090> let<00:01:47.299> me<00:01:47.390> tell<00:01:47.599> you<00:01:47.720> even<00:01:47.869> with<00:01:48.079> the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
even let me tell you even with the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.859 
even let me tell you even with the
condensation<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:49.039> store<00:01:49.250> works<00:01:49.459> fine<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.750> it

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
condensation in store works fine so it

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.830 
condensation in store works fine so it
