00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
a little gas canister on the table or

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
a little gas canister on the table or
anywhere<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> floor<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.840> need<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
anywhere on the floor you would need to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
anywhere on the floor you would need to
look<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:38.040> ended<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.340> turning<00:00:38.520> on

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
look for that and we ended up turning on

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.010 
look for that and we ended up turning on
the<00:00:38.790> power<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.420> things<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.899> don't

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the power just to make things I don't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.420 
the power just to make things I don't
know<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.320> makes<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> easier<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.309> can

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
know if it makes it easier but we can

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.680 
know if it makes it easier but we can
move<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.670> anyways<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.540> right

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
move on anyways just because it's right

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.260 
move on anyways just because it's right
there<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> ran<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> points<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> made

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
there and I ran out of points so I made

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360 
there and I ran out of points so I made
him<00:00:45.450> hoping<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.960> door<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
him hoping that door and what I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.360 
him hoping that door and what I
recommend<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.710> saving<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.829> quite<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> bit<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
recommend is a saving up quite a bit of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
recommend is a saving up quite a bit of
points<00:00:50.610> before<00:00:50.730> doing<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.390> we

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
points before doing this because we

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.060 
points before doing this because we
didn't<00:00:52.110> even<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.350> enough<00:00:52.530> points<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.980> your

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
didn't even have enough points that your

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.220 
didn't even have enough points that your
head<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.399> couch<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.870> ended<00:00:55.110> up

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
head of this couch so we ended up

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
head of this couch so we ended up
killing<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> couple<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:55.980> zombies<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.820> got

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
killing a couple more zombies and it got

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
killing a couple more zombies and it got
difficult<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.199> didn't<00:00:58.469> read<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
difficult because we didn't read it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
difficult because we didn't read it
elbow<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.670> didn't<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.030> any<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.109> had

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
elbow and we didn't have any all we had

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.479 
elbow and we didn't have any all we had
was<00:01:01.260> grenades<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:01.980> needed<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> pick<00:01:02.430> up

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
was grenades and we needed to pick up

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.570 
was grenades and we needed to pick up
the<00:01:02.699> pieces<00:01:02.730> still<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.480> after<00:01:04.379> after<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the pieces still so after after we get a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
the pieces still so after after we get a
loan<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.869> points<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> will

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
loan a little bit more points that will

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:17.539 
loan a little bit more points that will
be<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> after<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.920> had<00:01:17.009> enough<00:01:17.220> points<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be back so after we had enough points to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.039 
be back so after we had enough points to
open<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.150> ran<00:01:18.479> straight<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> warp

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
open it I ran straight to the warp

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.120 
open it I ran straight to the warp
engines<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.650> next<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:19.979> which<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
engines is right next well which is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
engines is right next well which is
actually<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.670> cool<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
actually pretty cool and if you look to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
actually pretty cool and if you look to
your<00:01:22.140> left<00:01:22.340> right<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.520> inside<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> kitchen

your left right there inside the kitchen

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
your left right there inside the kitchen
there<00:01:24.270> should<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> another<00:01:24.750> part<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.200> look

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there should be another part just look

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
there should be another part just look
for<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> should<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.159> top<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> bottom

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
for it should be on top or on the bottom

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
for it should be on top or on the bottom
around<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> floor<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.290> pick<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.530> up

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
around the floor you can just pick it up

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
around the floor you can just pick it up
and<00:01:28.829> add<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> work<00:01:29.340> bench<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and add it to the work bench as well and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
and add it to the work bench as well and
then<00:01:30.689> you're<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> turn<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.770> behind

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
then you're going to turn right behind

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.069 
then you're going to turn right behind
you<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> barrel<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you and on that barrel is going to be a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.200 
you and on that barrel is going to be a
another<00:01:34.680> piece<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.970> cool

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
another piece which is pretty cool

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.370 
another piece which is pretty cool
because<00:01:36.299> everything's<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.079> next<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
because everything's like right next to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
because everything's like right next to
each<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.560> still<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> once<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> add<00:01:39.930> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
each other still so once you add this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.249 
each other still so once you add this
piece<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.560> um<00:01:40.939> once<00:01:41.939> after<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> got<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.020> all
