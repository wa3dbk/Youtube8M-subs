 country and your xtreem motocross worldwide 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 practiced has its place of origin in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 california and since its first appearance 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.000
 He managed to draw the attention of both 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.130
 young and old dynamism and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.130
 value that the practitioners showed to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.099
 time to perform your routines 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.810
 in the mid-1970s the youth 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 Californian began to imitate the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.309
 motocross movements however 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.559
 for the lack of motorcycles and places 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.329
 special to practice they opted for 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.059
 perform pirouettes and jumps between 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
 bicycles and used as tracks the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
 streets and parks of the city the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 consolidation of the bmx occurred in the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.600
 early 1980's careers in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 ground circuits similar to those of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.010
 motocross began to generalize and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.010
 they received the title of reis 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.080
 in the middle of the same year appeared the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
 first exclusive bicycles 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 freestyle with which young people 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 adepts to the new sports practice 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 they went to the skate parks for 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.310
 perform a series of limited tricks 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
 at that time but that in the end 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.860
 would be the basis of the large amount of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.860
 tricks 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.570
 the growth of bmx at a 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.870
 international corresponds to the creation 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.650
 in the usa of the american bar association 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.570
 in 1977 which served as an entity 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.790
 national that made the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.400
 sport in its borders and introduced it 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.400
 in europe for the year of 1978 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.310
 in April 1981 the federation was founded 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.229
 international bmx and one year later 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.720
 celebrated the first world championship 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.270
 the uci international cycling union 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.190
 by its acronym in English to see the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 popularity of the pulgosa goes the new 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.110
 variant of cycling in January 1993 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.110
 he integrated her into his ranks 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.690
 and it was until the Beijing Olympics 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.750
 2008 when the bm x went on his way 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.239
 by becoming extreme sport with 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.069
 greater impact when making its appearance as 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.069
 Olympic sport exhibition 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.909
 It's so special 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.030
 in the city of ocotlan this sport 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.250
 began to become very famous among his 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.230
 inhabitants mainly those 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.510
 young people who like experiences 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.870
 extreme with the opening of the sky 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.520
 pads on January 9, 2005 located 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.410
 on the outskirts of the municipality the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.440
 increase of young practitioners of 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.440
 bmx is remarkable and the enthusiasm visible 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.760
 ride a bike like 1 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.660
 the ocotlense youth found in this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.640
 Sport an alternate and novel activity 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 that could not only be practiced in your 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.860
 streets but also in a created place 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.620
 specifically for its use that has been 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.989
 done before ground 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.360
 the only one there though in the park 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.489
 there are several ramps these are no longer 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.560
 enough for those who come because 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.170
 the influx of bmx practitioners 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.330
 It increases day by day without the 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.640
 presence of the skateboarding which prevents the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.140
 fluid practice of the two genres we're going 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.860
 well at least it must be honest 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:51.140
 little bit bigger because it's also the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.690
 panorama of bmx in ocotlÃ¡n is 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.000
 promising the talent and frenzy are already 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.250
 deposited in young people because the taste 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.349
 for acrobatics on the bicycle which 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.299
 is transmitted in person to person and is 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.390
 evident that the interest in this sport 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.980
 grows in the new generations if there 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.980
 some that are interested 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.090
 good 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.090
 good memory 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.629
 life with me 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.600
 but it is necessary to create new 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.190
 parks in other parts of the city as well 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.410
 as the organization of events for 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.570
 increase the new bikers and more 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.370
 that a passing recreation finds in 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.129
 a healthy activity that instills in them the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.619
 sports habit 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.349
 because it felt central adrenaline when 

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:56.199
 you fly high sometimes when you feel that 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.199
 you're going to fall and the pound feels 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.599
 adrenaline is one of the sensations 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.669
 what is more enjoyed what compensates the 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.680
 pain from scratches and bumps caused 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.680
 by the contact of the skin with the floor
