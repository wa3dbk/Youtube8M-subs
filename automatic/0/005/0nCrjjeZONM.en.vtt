00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
pulling pushing the lever up and it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140 
pulling pushing the lever up and it
doesn't<00:00:19.710> matter<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.010> leave<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.580> it

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
this one works I didn't a makeup route

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.819 
this one works I didn't a makeup route
for<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.350> kind<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> lead<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
for these so they just kind of lead you

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.330 
for these so they just kind of lead you
into<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> wall<00:00:41.809> but<00:00:42.809> i<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.530> i<00:00:43.739> found<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
into a wall but i have i found the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.830 
into a wall but i have i found the
infinity<00:00:45.030> cave<00:00:45.410> it's<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:47.039> big<00:00:47.719> case<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
infinity cave it's very big case you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.709 
infinity cave it's very big case you
didn't<00:00:49.050> already<00:00:49.079> figure<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.719> I've

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
didn't already figure that out but I've

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
didn't already figure that out but I've
two<00:00:51.930> different<00:00:52.230> areas<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.030> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
two different areas that I can go to so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.889 
two different areas that I can go to so
basically<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.960> works<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:57.420> cart<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
basically how it works this cart is

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
basically how it works this cart is
sitting<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.680> stone<00:00:59.370> plate<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
sitting on a stone plate so when you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.689 
sitting on a stone plate so when you
jump<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.890> weight<00:01:02.129> will<00:01:02.160> trigger

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
jump in it then your weight will trigger

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.200 
jump in it then your weight will trigger
the<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> plate<00:01:04.769> which<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the the plate which will you can see the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.520 
the the plate which will you can see the
wiring<00:01:06.540> coming<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> ground<00:01:07.170> over

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
wiring coming out of the ground over

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.550 
wiring coming out of the ground over
there<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:08.580> will<00:01:09.979> turn<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:12.110> track<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.470> I'm

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
there that will turn this track that I'm

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.340 
there that will turn this track that I'm
pointing<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.509> it'll<00:01:15.509> basically

don't just have a dead end on that block
over<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.640> flat-ass<00:02:03.210> top<00:02:03.619> because

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
over there just flat-ass top because

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
over there just flat-ass top because
when<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.729> card<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> front<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
when this card in the front is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.130 
when this card in the front is
redirected<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> boost<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.799> cart<00:02:08.069> then

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
redirected to boost this cart then

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.220 
redirected to boost this cart then
um<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:10.399> won't<00:02:10.759> be<00:02:11.060> coming<00:02:11.780> back<00:02:11.810> from<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
um it won't be coming back from the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.540 
um it won't be coming back from the
right<00:02:12.380> side<00:02:12.560> will<00:02:12.830> be<00:02:12.920> coming<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.310> from<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
right side will be coming in from the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.809 
right side will be coming in from the
left<00:02:13.730> side<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:15.400> let<00:02:16.400> me<00:02:16.490> just<00:02:16.640> demonstrate

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
left side so let me just demonstrate

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.000 
left side so let me just demonstrate
I'll<00:02:17.330> just<00:02:17.450> build<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.870> quick<00:02:18.080> switch<00:02:18.470> instead

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
I'll just build a quick switch instead

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.840 
I'll just build a quick switch instead
of<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.220> wire<00:02:20.620> um<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.280> watch<00:02:25.459> what<00:02:25.490> happens

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
of this wire um so watch what happens

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.570 
of this wire um so watch what happens
when<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.000> give<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:26.810> power<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.560> redirects<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
when I give this power it redirects and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.480 
when I give this power it redirects and
then<00:02:29.570> this<00:02:29.750> rolls<00:02:30.290> back<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.100> grabbed<00:02:31.340> by

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
then this rolls back to be grabbed by

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.630 
then this rolls back to be grabbed by
that<00:02:31.730> again<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.570> know<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.920> had<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.190> kind<00:02:34.310> of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
that again you know so I had to kind of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.920 
that again you know so I had to kind of
mess<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.239> finally<00:02:35.630> got<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
mess with that and I finally got it to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.120 
mess with that and I finally got it to
work<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.650> then<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:38.120> works<00:02:38.360> both<00:02:38.600> ways<00:02:38.870> so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
work so then it works both ways so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.460 
work so then it works both ways so
that's<00:02:40.130> how<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.310> works<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:45.140> will

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
that's how that works so and that will

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.250 
that's how that works so and that will
boost<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.920> Oh<00:02:46.190> worth<00:02:46.550> like<00:02:46.730> oh<00:02:47.050> yeah<00:02:48.050> here<00:02:48.200> it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
boost it Oh worth like oh yeah here it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.850 
boost it Oh worth like oh yeah here it
comes<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.530> guess<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.800> all<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.590> what

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
comes I guess I all right so what

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.300 
comes I guess I all right so what
happens<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.730> select<00:02:53.239> I'll<00:02:54.050> select<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.860> so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
happens if you select I'll select for so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.820 
happens if you select I'll select for so
you<00:02:55.370> jump<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:56.030> know<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.510> drags<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.680> in

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
you jump in you know and it drags you in

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.920 
you jump in you know and it drags you in
it<00:02:57.950> will<00:02:58.220> sort<00:02:58.540> depending<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.540> which<00:02:59.720> lever

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it will sort depending on which lever

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.530 
it will sort depending on which lever
you<00:03:00.280> chose<00:03:01.280> it'll<00:03:01.610> lead<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> different

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
you chose it'll lead you to a different

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.600 
you chose it'll lead you to a different
route<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.100> i'll<00:03:04.100> show<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.250> how<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.580> works

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
route and i'll show you how that works

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.729 
route and i'll show you how that works
too<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:05.209> basically<00:03:05.900> at<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.380> end<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.620> each

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
too but basically at the end of each

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.920 
too but basically at the end of each
route<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> set<00:03:07.370> up<00:03:07.459> this<00:03:07.550> other<00:03:07.930> boosting

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
route I set up this other boosting

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.310 
route I set up this other boosting
system<00:03:10.000> it's<00:03:11.000> kind<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> same<00:03:11.450> concept<00:03:12.140> so

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
system it's kind of the same concept so

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.720 
system it's kind of the same concept so
there's<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.560> stone<00:03:12.800> plate<00:03:13.100> underneath<00:03:13.430> this

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
there's a stone plate underneath this

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.990 
there's a stone plate underneath this
heart<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.290> when<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.500> jump<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:16.010> same<00:03:16.670> thing<00:03:16.880> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
heart so when you jump in same thing the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000 
heart so when you jump in same thing the
wiring<00:03:17.329> comes<00:03:17.510> around<00:03:17.810> right<00:03:18.410> there<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.769> red

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
wiring comes around right there that red

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.960 
wiring comes around right there that red
goes<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:20.000> I'll<00:03:20.540> show<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.370> wiring<00:03:22.760> comes

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
goes like I'll show you the wiring comes

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.120 
goes like I'll show you the wiring comes
from<00:03:23.120> underground<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.930> leads<00:03:24.530> up<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.890> way

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
from underground and leads up this way

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.270 
from underground and leads up this way
and<00:03:25.370> we'll<00:03:25.910> turn<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.650> turn<00:03:27.650> block<00:03:27.950> it'll

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
and we'll turn this turn block it'll

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.819 
and we'll turn this turn block it'll
turn<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.579> turn<00:03:29.360> piece<00:03:29.959> right<00:03:30.230> here<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.650> that

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
turn this turn piece right here to that

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.030 
turn this turn piece right here to that
and<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.280> will<00:03:31.370> i'll<00:03:32.209> show<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.680> i'll<00:03:33.799> be

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
and it will i'll show you and i'll be

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.819 
and it will i'll show you and i'll be
dragged<00:03:34.549> back<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:38.079> yep<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:39.440> that's<00:03:39.620> what<00:03:39.799> i

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
dragged back so yep so that's what i

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.560 
dragged back so yep so that's what i
have<00:03:40.070> at<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.370> end<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.640> every<00:03:40.940> route<00:03:41.150> i<00:03:41.360> just

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
have at the end of every route i just

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.490 
have at the end of every route i just
have<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.780> thing<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.650> i<00:03:43.070> use<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.579> same<00:03:44.090> track

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
have a thing and i use the same track

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.590 
have a thing and i use the same track
that<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.530> went<00:03:46.430> out<00:03:46.579> on<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.820> use<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.150> same<00:03:47.360> trip

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
that I went out on I use the same trip

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.880 
that I went out on I use the same trip
piece<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.900> track<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.230> come<00:03:48.350> back<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.769> very

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
piece of track to come back to it very

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.479 
piece of track to come back to it very
efficient<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.579> way<00:03:50.019> dang<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.049> alright<00:03:51.620> and

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
efficient that way dang it alright and

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.880 
efficient that way dang it alright and
if<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.850> jump<00:03:53.030> out<00:03:53.120> too<00:03:53.360> late<00:03:53.600> then<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.590> screws

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
if you jump out too late then it screws

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.610 
if you jump out too late then it screws
it<00:03:55.010> up<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.160> have<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.280> jump<00:03:55.489> out<00:03:55.640> before<00:03:55.970> parks

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
it up you have to jump out before parks

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.110 
it up you have to jump out before parks
um<00:03:58.180> let<00:03:59.180> me<00:03:59.209> see<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.980> way<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.430> sorting<00:04:02.000> room

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
um let me see the way the sorting room

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.690 
um let me see the way the sorting room
works<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.470> right<00:04:03.620> now<00:04:03.650> no<00:04:03.950> destination<00:04:04.400> is

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
works so right now no destination is

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.569 
works so right now no destination is
selected<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:05.630> when<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.560> car<00:04:06.739> comes<00:04:06.890> in<00:04:07.070> it

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
selected so when the car comes in it

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.460 
selected so when the car comes in it
goes<00:04:07.760> on<00:04:07.880> this<00:04:07.970> S<00:04:08.180> curve<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:09.049> continues

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
goes on this S curve and it continues

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.490 
goes on this S curve and it continues
down<00:04:09.500> as<00:04:09.950> soon<00:04:10.790> as<00:04:11.690> soon<00:04:11.870> as<00:04:11.989> one<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.200> these<00:04:12.380> is

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
down as soon as soon as one of these is

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.069 
down as soon as soon as one of these is
turned<00:04:12.709> on<00:04:12.829> then<00:04:13.100> it'll<00:04:13.310> pick<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.700> turn<00:04:14.079> it's

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
turned on then it'll pick that turn it's

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.569 
turned on then it'll pick that turn it's
like<00:04:15.200> if<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.500> know<00:04:15.590> any<00:04:15.799> programming<00:04:16.250> it's

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
like if you know any programming it's

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.199 
like if you know any programming it's
like<00:04:16.760> if<00:04:17.570> else<00:04:17.900> statements<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.549> let's<00:04:19.970> turn<00:04:20.090> on

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
like if else statements so let's turn on

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.280 
like if else statements so let's turn on
the<00:04:20.239> first<00:04:20.539> one

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
the first one

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.400 
the first one
you<00:04:21.800> can<00:04:21.890> see<00:04:22.040> this<00:04:22.220> light<00:04:22.520> comes<00:04:22.760> on<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.410> that

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
you can see this light comes on and that

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.650 
you can see this light comes on and that
turns<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.190> block<00:04:25.820> instead<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.330> turning<00:04:26.540> left

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
turns this block instead of turning left

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.580 
turns this block instead of turning left
it<00:04:27.170> directs<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.340> way<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:30.470> know

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
it directs it that way so you know

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.140 
it directs it that way so you know
higher<00:04:30.950> numbers<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.430> priority<00:04:31.910> no<00:04:32.000> matter

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
higher numbers have priority no matter

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.630 
higher numbers have priority no matter
what<00:04:32.360> if<00:04:32.600> more<00:04:33.350> than<00:04:33.410> one<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.710> turned<00:04:33.980> on<00:04:34.070> it'll

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
what if more than one I turned on it'll

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.160 
what if more than one I turned on it'll
just<00:04:34.670> pick<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.270> first<00:04:35.420> one<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.720> ignore<00:04:36.140> the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
just pick the first one and ignore the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.430 
just pick the first one and ignore the
rest<00:04:36.290> of<00:04:36.590> these<00:04:36.790> on<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:39.620> wiring<00:04:40.070> for<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.370> is

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
rest of these on the wiring for that is

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.220 
rest of these on the wiring for that is
it<00:04:42.440> goes<00:04:42.910> right<00:04:43.910> over<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.180> track<00:04:44.540> let<00:04:45.050> me<00:04:45.110> see

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
it goes right over the track let me see

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.860 
it goes right over the track let me see
if<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.380> can<00:04:45.500> jump<00:04:45.680> up<00:04:45.860> here<00:04:46.180> alright<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.510> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
if I can jump up here alright so the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.780 
if I can jump up here alright so the
lever<00:04:48.110> levers<00:04:48.980> are<00:04:49.130> like<00:04:49.280> right<00:04:49.550> on<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
lever levers are like right on the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.730 
lever levers are like right on the
opposite<00:04:50.390> side<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.750> wall<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.050> wiring

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
opposite side of the wall the wiring

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.730 
opposite side of the wall the wiring
comes<00:04:51.920> over<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> track<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:53.350> around<00:04:54.350> this<00:04:54.470> way

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
comes over the track and around this way

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.490 
comes over the track and around this way
and<00:04:55.030> these<00:04:56.030> are<00:04:56.450> what<00:04:56.750> move<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.680> tracks<00:04:57.950> um

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
and these are what move the tracks um

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.900 
and these are what move the tracks um
yeah<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:00.710> no<00:05:00.860> destination<00:05:01.250> selected<00:05:01.820> you

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
yeah and if no destination selected you

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.470 
yeah and if no destination selected you
know<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.150> goes<00:05:02.300> back<00:05:03.340> underground<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:05.060> it

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
know it goes back underground and it

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.150 
know it goes back underground and it
just<00:05:05.510> meets<00:05:05.870> up<00:05:06.080> with<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.350> returning<00:05:06.830> track

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
just meets up with the returning track

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.640 
just meets up with the returning track
and<00:05:08.380> this<00:05:09.380> it'll<00:05:09.770> come<00:05:09.920> up<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.130> way<00:05:10.340> and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
and this it'll come up this way and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.030 
and this it'll come up this way and
merge<00:05:12.650> together<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:14.740> when<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.220> imagine<00:05:16.460> i<00:05:16.730> had

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
merge together and when so imagine i had

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.060 
merge together and when so imagine i had
number<00:05:19.040> 5<00:05:19.250> turned<00:05:19.550> on<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:21.440> cart<00:05:21.680> will<00:05:21.800> go<00:05:21.920> out

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
number 5 turned on the cart will go out

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.310 
number 5 turned on the cart will go out
this<00:05:22.220> direction<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.870> then<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:24.080> know<00:05:24.200> it

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
this direction and then you know it

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.870 
this direction and then you know it
comes<00:05:24.500> back<00:05:24.770> from<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.070> same<00:05:25.250> direction<00:05:25.490> so<00:05:25.790> it

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
comes back from the same direction so it

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.090 
comes back from the same direction so it
uses<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.120> same<00:05:26.210> track<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.960> since<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:27.860> was

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
uses the same track and since that was

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.990 
uses the same track and since that was
turned<00:05:28.340> on<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:29.270> will<00:05:29.410> redirect<00:05:30.820> going<00:05:31.820> back

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
turned on it will redirect going back

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.520 
turned on it will redirect going back
the<00:05:32.210> opposite<00:05:32.660> direction<00:05:32.750> no<00:05:33.170> matter<00:05:33.320> which

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
the opposite direction no matter which

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.130 
the opposite direction no matter which
route<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.490> coming<00:05:34.910> from<00:05:35.000> it'll<00:05:35.300> just<00:05:35.990> head

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
route is coming from it'll just head

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.800 
route is coming from it'll just head
backwards<00:05:36.680> on<00:05:36.800> this<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.280> s<00:05:37.460> track<00:05:38.090> it'll<00:05:38.360> come

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
backwards on this the s track it'll come

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.460 
backwards on this the s track it'll come
back<00:05:38.840> this<00:05:39.110> way<00:05:39.760> andrey<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:40.970> merge<00:05:41.900> back<00:05:42.170> into

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
back this way andrey and merge back into

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.290 
back this way andrey and merge back into
this<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:43.870> i<00:05:44.870> guess<00:05:45.380> that's<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:46.240> kind<00:05:47.240> of

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
this and i guess that's it kind of

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.930 
this and i guess that's it kind of
complicated<00:05:47.780> but<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:49.010> works<00:05:49.790> really<00:05:50.000> well<00:05:50.150> so

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
complicated but it works really well so

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.370 
complicated but it works really well so
i'll<00:05:52.940> just<00:05:52.970> do<00:05:53.330> one<00:05:53.600> route<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:54.020> show<00:05:54.170> you<00:05:54.230> the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
i'll just do one route to show you the

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.770 
i'll just do one route to show you the
full<00:05:54.560> route<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:55.610> 5<00:05:56.180> goes<00:05:56.570> up<00:05:57.050> and<00:05:58.120> it<00:05:59.950> goes<00:06:00.950> down

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
full route so 5 goes up and it goes down

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.770 
full route so 5 goes up and it goes down
this<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:02.930> a<00:06:02.960> huge<00:06:03.350> cave<00:06:03.620> that<00:06:03.830> i<00:06:03.860> found<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:05.690> i

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
this is a huge cave that i found and i

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.980 
this is a huge cave that i found and i
have<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> boosting<00:06:06.560> system<00:06:06.890> at<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.070> bottom<00:06:07.990> see

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
have a boosting system at the bottom see

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.420 
have a boosting system at the bottom see
they're<00:06:09.110> already<00:06:09.260> running<00:06:09.440> this<00:06:10.100> is<00:06:10.280> on<00:06:10.400> a

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
they're already running this is on a

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.590 
they're already running this is on a
stone<00:06:10.760> plate<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:13.100> wiring<00:06:13.580> I<00:06:13.790> just<00:06:14.240> kicked

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
stone plate and the wiring I just kicked

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.520 
stone plate and the wiring I just kicked
it<00:06:14.810> that<00:06:15.320> sucks<00:06:15.620> anyways<00:06:16.460> the<00:06:16.580> wiring<00:06:16.970> comes

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
it that sucks anyways the wiring comes

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.260 
it that sucks anyways the wiring comes
over<00:06:18.530> here<00:06:18.740> and<00:06:18.950> turns<00:06:19.460> this<00:06:19.640> track<00:06:19.910> which

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
over here and turns this track which

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.200 
over here and turns this track which
will<00:06:20.510> boost<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.680> one<00:06:21.920> so<00:06:22.280> I<00:06:22.460> just<00:06:22.640> push<00:06:23.030> this

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
will boost that one so I just push this
