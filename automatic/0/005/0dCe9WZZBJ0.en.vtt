steering<00:02:38.290> wheel<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.800> enjoyed<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:41.100> having<00:02:42.100> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
steering wheel I enjoyed that having a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.590 
steering wheel I enjoyed that having a
steering<00:02:42.520> wheel<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.940> guess<00:02:43.060> it's<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
steering wheel I guess it's like the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.890 
steering wheel I guess it's like the
helm<00:02:43.870> would<00:02:44.830> be<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.070> correct<00:02:45.610> term<00:02:46.210> for<00:02:46.480> this

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
helm would be the correct term for this

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
helm would be the correct term for this
room<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.470> anyway<00:02:48.160> you've<00:02:48.310> got<00:02:48.460> your

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
room but anyway you've got your

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.220 
room but anyway you've got your
navigation<00:02:50.920> seats<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.270> thought<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.140> as

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
navigation seats like I thought of it as

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.210 
navigation seats like I thought of it as
radar<00:02:53.530> back<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:55.320> you'll<00:02:56.320> see<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.710> sec<00:02:56.950> but

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
radar back here you'll see in a sec but

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.970 
radar back here you'll see in a sec but
it<00:02:58.030> looks<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.240> almost<00:02:59.050> looks<00:02:59.380> like<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.530> bed<00:02:59.950> or

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it looks like almost looks like a bed or

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.270 
it looks like almost looks like a bed or
like<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> big<00:03:00.700> couch<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.300> then<00:03:01.870> you've<00:03:02.020> got

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
like a big couch and then you've got

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.430 
like a big couch and then you've got
weapons<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.790> stuff<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.270> table<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.810> then

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
weapons and stuff on the table and then

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.540 
weapons and stuff on the table and then
there's<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:06.100> sword<00:03:06.790> over<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:07.270> just<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.630> case

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
there's a sword over here just in case

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.970 
there's a sword over here just in case
and<00:03:09.550> then<00:03:10.210> like<00:03:10.660> over<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> left<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.770> look

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and then like over to the left to look

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.040 
and then like over to the left to look
at<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> second<00:03:12.790> but<00:03:12.970> I'm<00:03:13.750> pretty<00:03:13.930> sure

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
at it in a second but I'm pretty sure

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.729 
at it in a second but I'm pretty sure
there<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:15.070> like<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> radar<00:03:16.480> booth<00:03:16.900> kind<00:03:17.650> of

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
thing for the navigator to be at and he

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.210 
thing for the navigator to be at and he
can<00:03:21.850> be<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.170> captain<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.320> have<00:03:23.350> two<00:03:23.770> bogeys

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
can be like captain we have two bogeys

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.949 
can be like captain we have two bogeys
on<00:03:24.340> or<00:03:24.520> six<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:25.090> know<00:03:25.180> there's<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.540> camping

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
on or six you know there's a camping

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.420 
on or six you know there's a camping
stool<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.260> front<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:26.800> that's<00:03:27.130> what<00:03:27.340> I

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
stool in front of it so that's what I

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550 
stool in front of it so that's what I
imagine<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.239> get<00:03:28.570> off<00:03:28.690> my<00:03:28.720> back<00:03:29.020> if<00:03:29.260> i'm<00:03:29.380> wrong

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
imagine so get off my back if i'm wrong

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.070 
imagine so get off my back if i'm wrong
but<00:03:29.620> anyway<00:03:30.580> then<00:03:30.790> there's<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.209> golf<00:03:31.510> club<00:03:31.780> over

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
but anyway then there's a golf club over

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.610 
but anyway then there's a golf club over
here<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:33.040> guess<00:03:33.580> if<00:03:33.760> there<00:03:34.540> was<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:35.020> be<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.170> mutiny

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
here I guess if there was to be a mutiny

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.229 
here I guess if there was to be a mutiny
that's<00:03:36.010> what<00:03:36.220> they'd<00:03:36.370> kill<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.700> captain<00:03:37.090> with

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
that's what they'd kill the captain with

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.810 
that's what they'd kill the captain with
that's<00:03:38.110> what<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.320> would<00:03:38.380> pick<00:03:38.680> both<00:03:39.489> pissed

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
that's what I would pick both pissed

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.699 
that's what I would pick both pissed
enough<00:03:39.970> at<00:03:40.239> my<00:03:40.390> captain<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.110> want<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.350> mutiny

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
enough at my captain to want a mutiny

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.380 
enough at my captain to want a mutiny
against<00:03:42.130> him<00:03:42.280> then<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.760> want<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> kill<00:03:43.269> them

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
against him then I want to kill them

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.540 
against him then I want to kill them
with<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.630> blunt<00:03:43.840> object<00:03:43.989> not<00:03:44.920> like<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> shotgun

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
with a blunt object not like a shotgun

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.300 
with a blunt object not like a shotgun
or<00:03:45.760> something<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.720> then<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.800> can<00:03:47.950> go<00:03:48.100> through

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
pinnacle just froze but it's still going

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.990 
pinnacle just froze but it's still going
so<00:04:27.230> I'm<00:04:28.230> at<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.890> bright<00:04:29.310> now<00:04:29.490> i'm<00:04:29.790> watching

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
so I'm at the bright now i'm watching

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.930 
so I'm at the bright now i'm watching
the<00:04:30.360> part<00:04:30.630> where<00:04:30.960> he's<00:04:31.650> jumps<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.370> banjee

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
the part where he's jumps in the banjee

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.610 
the part where he's jumps in the banjee
right<00:04:33.740> now<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.970> if<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.600> happened<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:37.230> ten

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
right now so if that happened like ten

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.930 
right now so if that happened like ten
seconds<00:04:38.130> ago<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.610> do<00:04:38.970> apologize<00:04:40.760> I'm<00:04:41.760> not

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
seconds ago I do apologize I'm not

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.590 
seconds ago I do apologize I'm not
really<00:04:42.180> sure<00:04:42.330> what<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:42.900> happened<00:04:43.610> but<00:04:44.610> I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
really sure what just happened but I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600 
really sure what just happened but I
think<00:04:46.380> it's<00:04:46.650> probably<00:04:46.920> because<00:04:47.220> I'm<00:04:47.430> trying

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
think it's probably because I'm trying

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.730 
think it's probably because I'm trying
to<00:04:47.760> render<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.090> video<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.840> Sony<00:04:49.140> Vegas<00:04:49.230> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
to render a video in Sony Vegas and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.910 
to render a video in Sony Vegas and
record<00:04:50.490> commentary<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.540> this<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.650> could

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
record commentary for this so that could

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.940 
record commentary for this so that could
be<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.100> possibility<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:54.720> don't<00:04:55.440> really<00:04:55.740> know

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
be a possibility I don't really know

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.820 
be a possibility I don't really know
though<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.780> we<00:04:57.780> just<00:04:57.960> skip<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.500> part<00:04:58.680> where

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
though so we just skip to the part where

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.400 
though so we just skip to the part where
he<00:04:59.310> falls<00:04:59.520> down<00:04:59.790> onto<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.480> ramp<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.900> there's

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
he falls down onto the ramp and there's

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.490 
he falls down onto the ramp and there's
like<00:05:01.590> another<00:05:01.890> little<00:05:02.790> place<00:05:03.510> here<00:05:03.540> another

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
like another little place here another

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.710 
like another little place here another
building<00:05:05.010> where<00:05:05.250> we<00:05:05.400> started<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:05.970> that's

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
building where we started and that's

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.040 
building where we started and that's
just<00:05:06.870> got<00:05:07.050> some<00:05:07.170> weapons<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.680> stuff<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.160> um

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
just got some weapons and stuff so um

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.540 
just got some weapons and stuff so um
yeah<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.410> do<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.620> plot<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:10.950> don't<00:05:11.130> know<00:05:11.220> how<00:05:11.400> this

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
yeah I do a plot I don't know how this

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.010 
yeah I do a plot I don't know how this
is<00:05:11.610> going<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.910> work<00:05:12.060> out<00:05:12.300> now<00:05:12.330> because<00:05:12.690> my

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
is going to work out now because my

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.590 
is going to work out now because my
intro<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:14.250> probably<00:05:14.670> going<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.880> be<00:05:15.000> off<00:05:15.180> by

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
intro is probably going to be off by

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.540 
intro is probably going to be off by
like<00:05:15.810> ten<00:05:16.290> seconds<00:05:16.680> now<00:05:16.890> or<00:05:17.070> my<00:05:17.160> outro<00:05:17.520> I

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
like ten seconds now or my outro I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.980 
like ten seconds now or my outro I
should<00:05:17.820> say<00:05:17.970> actually<00:05:18.090> it's<00:05:18.570> going<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.750> be<00:05:18.840> off

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
should say actually it's going to be off

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.990 
should say actually it's going to be off
by<00:05:19.230> like<00:05:19.410> ten<00:05:19.740> seconds<00:05:20.130> now<00:05:20.340> because<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.820> that

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
by like ten seconds now because of that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.930 
by like ten seconds now because of that
random<00:05:21.240> fries<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:22.410> you'll<00:05:22.620> see<00:05:22.920> that<00:05:23.130> you'll

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
random fries so you'll see that you'll

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.270 
random fries so you'll see that you'll
probably<00:05:24.180> see<00:05:24.600> them<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:25.290> then<00:05:25.500> like<00:05:26.130> I'm
