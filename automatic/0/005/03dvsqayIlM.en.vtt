 people who already have an agreement 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.630
 I feel that there was more in it 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 at sea 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 entrance fee of 5 euros

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.099
 most cases 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 out of the starting blocks 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.819
 the editorial staff 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.819

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.229
 lorenzo 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 and ensembles
