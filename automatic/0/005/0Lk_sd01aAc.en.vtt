to do I'll call you
we<00:02:27.010> started<00:02:27.490> out<00:02:27.610> wanting<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.270> do<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.810> motion

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
we started out wanting to do a motion

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.470 
we started out wanting to do a motion
capture<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.700> voice<00:02:31.209> acting

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
capture and then do voice acting

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.330 
capture and then do voice acting
separately<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> kind<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.620> combine<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.160> is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
separately and I kind of combine this is

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.220 
separately and I kind of combine this is
a<00:02:33.370> classical<00:02:33.910> way<00:02:34.030> at<00:02:34.360> least<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.840> us<00:02:34.959> to

a classical way at least for us to
produce<00:02:35.740> cutscenes<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.430> we<00:02:36.910> were<00:02:37.030> allowed<00:02:37.300> to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
produce cutscenes but we were allowed to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
Travis no this is my prayer time this

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.860 
Travis no this is my prayer time this
definitely<00:02:51.580> reminded<00:02:52.209> me<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.390> making

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
definitely reminded me of making

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.610 
definitely reminded me of making
literally<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.530> motion<00:02:54.130> picture<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:56.110> that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
literally a motion picture and and that

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.240 
literally a motion picture and and that
it's<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.640> very<00:02:58.510> beautiful<00:02:59.140> very<00:02:59.170> clear<00:03:00.070> and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
it's like very beautiful very clear and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.979 
it's like very beautiful very clear and
and<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.790> think<00:03:00.820> that<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.269> wonderful<00:03:01.600> aspect

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
and I think that it's a wonderful aspect

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.180 
and I think that it's a wonderful aspect
that<00:03:02.080> they<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.560> they've<00:03:02.739> added<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.100> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
that they that they've added to the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.550 
that they that they've added to the
video<00:03:03.430> game<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.000> basics<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.630> motion<00:03:05.140> capture

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
video game the basics of motion capture

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.860 
video game the basics of motion capture
is<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:06.550> have<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.940> series<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.390> cameras

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
is that we have a series of cameras

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.890 
is that we have a series of cameras
placed<00:03:08.140> around<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.620> room<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.190> they<00:03:09.280> record

placed around a room and they record

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.210 
placed around a room and they record
optically<00:03:10.900> these<00:03:11.290> little<00:03:11.650> markers<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.040> are

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
optically these little markers that are

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.660 
optically these little markers that are
placed<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:13.030> actors<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.800> it<00:03:14.800> triangulates

the data in the space and records
movement<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.730> cover<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.420> actors<00:03:19.750> with

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
movement and we cover the actors with

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.990 
movement and we cover the actors with
all<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.200> these<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:21.250> can<00:03:21.430> tell<00:03:21.610> where<00:03:21.819> their

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
all of these and we can tell where their

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.170 
all of these and we can tell where their

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and that gets applied to the skeletons

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.559 
and that gets applied to the skeletons
of<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.830> characters<00:03:27.280> where<00:03:28.060> performance

of the characters where performance

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.509 
of the characters where performance
capture<00:03:28.810> comes<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.500> similar<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.069> on<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.310> far

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
capture comes in is similar but on a far

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.569 
capture comes in is similar but on a far
more<00:03:30.760> subtle<00:03:31.630> level<00:03:31.930> we<00:03:32.590> had<00:03:33.340> a

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
more subtle level we had a

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.130 
more subtle level we had a
helmet-mounted<00:03:33.880> camera<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.660> use<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.840> as

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
helmet-mounted camera and use that as

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.660 
helmet-mounted camera and use that as
reference<00:03:35.530> for<00:03:35.590> key<00:03:35.860> framing<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.459> have<00:03:36.579> to

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
reference for key framing you have to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.430 
reference for key framing you have to
mark<00:03:36.880> her<00:03:37.000> up<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> face<00:03:37.450> there's<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.260> lot<00:03:38.290> of

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
mark her up the face there's a lot of

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.920 
mark her up the face there's a lot of
micro<00:03:38.860> movements<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.579> captured<00:03:39.930> and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
micro movements that get captured and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.780 
micro movements that get captured and
that<00:03:41.079> goes<00:03:41.290> through<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> similar<00:03:41.980> process<00:03:42.130> but

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
that goes through a similar process but

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.600 
that goes through a similar process but
it's<00:03:43.390> usually<00:03:43.690> requires<00:03:44.320> far<00:03:44.920> more<00:03:44.980> cameras

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
it's usually requires far more cameras

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.670 
it's usually requires far more cameras
to<00:03:46.000> pick<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.570> smaller<00:03:46.840> dots<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
to pick up the smaller dots and the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.979 
to pick up the smaller dots and the
smaller<00:03:48.430> ranges<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.970> movement<00:03:49.329> also<00:03:49.810> with

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
smaller ranges of movement also with

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.770 
smaller ranges of movement also with
ours<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.560> required<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.340> soundproof<00:03:52.030> studio<00:03:52.540> on

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
ours it required a soundproof studio on

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.930 
ours it required a soundproof studio on
its<00:03:52.900> giant<00:03:53.320> head<00:03:53.500> where<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:53.890> shot<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:54.790> could

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
its giant head where we shot so we could

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.569 
its giant head where we shot so we could
have<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:56.200> actors<00:03:56.560> voices<00:03:56.590> synced<00:03:57.430> up<00:03:57.519> with

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
have the actors voices synced up with

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.220 
have the actors voices synced up with
their<00:03:57.820> movement<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.810> get<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:58.989> more

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
their movement and just get a more

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.690 
their movement and just get a more
believable<00:03:59.530> performance<00:04:00.310> out<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.430> them<00:04:00.579> that

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
believable performance out of them that

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.340 
believable performance out of them that
was<00:04:00.820> really<00:04:01.030> important<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.480> us<00:04:01.570> well<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.200> always

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
was really important to us well I always

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.250 
was really important to us well I always

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
most natural performance an actor will

the focus level that it takes is unique

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.120 
the focus level that it takes is unique
within<00:04:54.260> itself<00:04:54.680> playing<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.729> lot<00:04:56.090> of

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
within itself playing a lot of

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.260 
within itself playing a lot of
technology<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.160> you're<00:04:58.580> pretending<00:04:58.910> is<00:04:59.090> not

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
technology that you're pretending is not

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.980 
technology that you're pretending is not
there<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:01.070> it's<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.550> whole<00:05:01.729> other<00:05:01.760> thing<00:05:02.300> that

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
there so it's a whole other thing that

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.890 
there so it's a whole other thing that
takes<00:05:03.710> some<00:05:03.889> adjusting<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.550> get<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:04.940> example

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
takes some adjusting to get to example

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.820 
takes some adjusting to get to example
just<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.199> simple<00:05:06.530> thing<00:05:06.770> like<00:05:08.380> see<00:05:09.380> this<00:05:09.590> thing

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
just a simple thing like see this thing

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.140 
just a simple thing like see this thing
right<00:05:10.010> in<00:05:10.130> front<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.340> your<00:05:10.430> face<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.970> very

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
right in front of your face it's very

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.850 
right in front of your face it's very
hard<00:05:11.389> to<00:05:11.419> focus<00:05:11.660> on<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.200> other<00:05:12.380> actor<00:05:12.770> if

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
hard to focus on the other actor if

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.290 
hard to focus on the other actor if
that's<00:05:13.040> there<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:13.520> like<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:13.940> character

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
that's there and like this character

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.350 
that's there and like this character
smokes<00:05:14.979> so<00:05:15.979> just<00:05:16.310> technically<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:17.060> can't

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
smokes so just technically you can't

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.700 
smokes so just technically you can't
bring<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.600> cigarette<00:05:17.990> up<00:05:18.139> because<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.410> smack

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
bring a cigarette up because you smack

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.080 
bring a cigarette up because you smack
into<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:19.070> camera<00:05:19.340> so<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.610> have<00:05:19.729> to<00:05:19.820> find<00:05:19.970> a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
into that camera so you have to find a

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.460 
into that camera so you have to find a
way<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.360> looks<00:05:20.510> cool<00:05:20.810> and<00:05:20.960> goes<00:05:21.139> in<00:05:21.320> there

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
way that looks cool and goes in there

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.909 
way that looks cool and goes in there
and<00:05:21.620> does<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:22.419> so<00:05:23.419> it<00:05:23.570> was<00:05:23.690> challenging<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
and does it so it was challenging the

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.409 
and does it so it was challenging the
axis<00:05:25.250> did<00:05:25.400> have<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.580> lot<00:05:25.760> of<00:05:25.790> good<00:05:25.910> suggestions

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
axis did have a lot of good suggestions

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.390 
axis did have a lot of good suggestions
and<00:05:26.960> they<00:05:27.200> would<00:05:27.350> say<00:05:27.500> this<00:05:27.770> feels<00:05:28.039> like<00:05:28.160> out

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
and they would say this feels like out

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.010 
and they would say this feels like out
of<00:05:28.520> character<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:29.030> we<00:05:29.330> black<00:05:29.570> that's<00:05:29.780> true

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
of character and we black that's true

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.930 
of character and we black that's true

getting little deeper into the

getting little deeper into the
characters<00:05:37.430> like<00:05:37.580> giving<00:05:37.850> them<00:05:37.970> some<00:05:38.180> layers

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
the origin of it is very much on the

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.610 
the origin of it is very much on the
actors<00:05:43.330> shoulders<00:05:44.330> but<00:05:44.600> from<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.020> point<00:05:45.169> on
