general changes improvement to pathing

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.770 
general changes improvement to pathing
so<00:00:43.470> blah<00:00:44.460> cramps<00:00:44.909> and<00:00:45.030> choke<00:00:45.239> points<00:00:45.600> that's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
so blah cramps and choke points that's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
so blah cramps and choke points that's
that's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.229> nice<00:00:46.379> improvement<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.970> made<00:00:48.780> to

that's a nice improvement and made to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.539 
that's a nice improvement and made to
change<00:00:49.049> house<00:00:49.290> earn<00:00:49.500> creep<00:00:49.799> effects<00:00:50.159> doodads

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
change house earn creep effects doodads

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.100 
change house earn creep effects doodads
such<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.970> trees<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.510> prevent<00:00:51.809> players<00:00:51.989> from

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
such as trees to prevent players from

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
such as trees to prevent players from
seeing<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> starting<00:00:52.739> location<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.309> their

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
seeing the starting location of their

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.359 
seeing the starting location of their
players<00:00:53.729> through<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.299> fog<00:00:54.540> of<00:00:54.570> war<00:00:54.839> that<00:00:55.769> is

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
players through the fog of war that is

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.399 
players through the fog of war that is
smart<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.119> didn't<00:00:57.449> even<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.659> that<00:00:57.720> happened

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
smart I didn't even know that happened

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.979 
smart I didn't even know that happened
that's<00:00:59.070> probably<00:00:59.610> good<00:00:59.970> change<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.720> right<00:01:00.869> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that's probably good change all right so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's probably good change all right so
we're<00:01:01.080> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> move<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.530> terran<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
we're going to move on to terran the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.800 
we're going to move on to terran the
Viking<00:01:03.260> cost<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:05.519> minerals<00:01:06.000> vespene<00:01:06.810> gas

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Viking cost up for minerals vespene gas

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.980 
Viking cost up for minerals vespene gas
went<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.649> 25<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.399> plus<00:01:08.609> 25<00:01:09.000> minerals<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.600> 25

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
went down 25 so plus 25 minerals down 25

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.510 
went down 25 so plus 25 minerals down 25
gas

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.749 

not<00:01:13.180> really<00:01:13.810> gonna<00:01:13.990> change<00:01:14.350> much<00:01:15.189> it's<00:01:15.520> still

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
not really gonna change much it's still

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.849 
not really gonna change much it's still
going<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.939> be<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.060> mast<00:01:16.359> unit<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.109> inba<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.710> my

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
going to be a mast unit and inba in my

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.959 
going to be a mast unit and inba in my
opinion<00:01:18.100> but<00:01:18.630> ghost<00:01:19.630> biggest<00:01:20.289> biggest<00:01:21.100> change

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
opinion but ghost biggest biggest change

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.929 
opinion but ghost biggest biggest change
that<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.299> thought<00:01:22.600> cost<00:01:23.549> increased<00:01:24.549> for

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
that I thought cost increased for

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.669 
that I thought cost increased for
minerals<00:01:25.569> decreased<00:01:26.170> for<00:01:26.350> gas<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.950> another

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
minerals decreased for gas so another

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.059 
minerals decreased for gas so another
moot<00:01:30.450> change<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.750> little<00:01:32.020> more<00:01:32.140> yet<00:01:32.380> or<00:01:32.619> less

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
moot change a little more yet or less

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.029 
moot change a little more yet or less
gas<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:33.759> easier<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.270> build<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.750> my<00:01:34.869> opinion<00:01:35.140> EMP

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
gas so easier to build in my opinion EMP

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.559 
gas so easier to build in my opinion EMP
round<00:01:36.280> radius<00:01:36.640> decrease<00:01:37.000> from<00:01:37.119> three<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.420> two

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
round radius decrease from three to two

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.559 
round radius decrease from three to two
big<00:01:38.200> boost<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.159> Protoss<00:01:39.549> this<00:01:40.209> is<00:01:40.390> now

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
big boost for the Protoss this is now

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.059 
big boost for the Protoss this is now
going<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.840> make<00:01:40.959> high<00:01:41.110> templars<00:01:41.500> way<00:01:41.860> more

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
going to make high templars way more

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.340 
going to make high templars way more
effective<00:01:42.280> against<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.729> Protoss<00:01:43.119> race<00:01:43.450> are

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
effective against the Protoss race are

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.529 
effective against the Protoss race are
high<00:01:45.280> templars<00:01:45.640> rape<00:01:45.909> way<00:01:46.149> more<00:01:46.390> effective

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
high templars rape way more effective

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.010 
high templars rape way more effective
against<00:01:46.989> the<00:01:47.079> Terran<00:01:47.380> race<00:01:47.560> excuse<00:01:48.009> me<00:01:48.159> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
against the Terran race excuse me and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.199 
against the Terran race excuse me and
yeah<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.159> going<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.340> be<00:01:51.429> a<00:01:51.459> big<00:01:52.149> big<00:01:52.869> big

going to be in but yet but I know the
ghosts<00:01:58.929> were<00:01:59.049> pretty<00:01:59.349> drastic<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.360> Protoss

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
ghosts were pretty drastic to Protoss

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.979 
ghosts were pretty drastic to Protoss
high<00:02:01.509> templars<00:02:02.579> factory<00:02:03.579> here<00:02:04.509> we<00:02:04.630> got<00:02:04.750> here

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
high templars factory here we got here

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.800 
high templars factory here we got here
costs<00:02:05.500> decrease<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:07.179> know<00:02:07.299> concerning

costs decrease so you know concerning

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.859 
costs decrease so you know concerning
factories<00:02:08.349> aren't<00:02:08.560> are<00:02:09.250> pretty<00:02:09.579> much<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.869> you

here<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.110> think<00:03:11.410> Marines<00:03:12.370> build<00:03:13.210> time

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
here I think Marines build time

more<00:04:18.810> effective<00:04:19.170> against<00:04:19.350> all<00:04:19.560> units<00:04:19.980> and

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
more effective against all units and

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.700 
more effective against all units and
they're<00:04:21.840> going<00:04:21.960> to<00:04:22.050> do<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.230> same<00:04:22.290> amount<00:04:22.530> of

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
they're going to do the same amount of

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.000 
they're going to do the same amount of
damage<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.010> armored<00:04:23.690> weapon<00:04:24.690> upgrade<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.560> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
damage to armored weapon upgrade so the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.340 
damage to armored weapon upgrade so the
upgrades<00:04:26.400> only<00:04:26.640> going<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.880> add<00:04:26.970> +1<00:04:27.300> damage<00:04:28.050> to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
upgrades only going to add +1 damage to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.190 
upgrades only going to add +1 damage to
their<00:04:29.250> particle<00:04:29.730> disruptors<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.330> knock<00:04:30.870> it's

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
their particle disruptors and knock it's

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.300 
their particle disruptors and knock it's
not<00:04:31.380> going<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.560> make<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.710> difference<00:04:31.800> against

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
not going to make a difference against

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.090 
not going to make a difference against
armored<00:04:32.610> like<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:32.880> used<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.650> dark<00:04:34.650> templars

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
armored like you used to dark templars

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.140 
armored like you used to dark templars
and<00:04:35.430> high<00:04:35.850> templars<00:04:36.300> biological<00:04:37.050> psionic<00:04:37.620> to

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
and high templars biological psionic to

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.880 
and high templars biological psionic to
biological<00:04:39.150> psionic<00:04:39.510> light<00:04:39.810> armor<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:40.620> i'm

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
biological psionic light armor so i'm

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.190 
biological psionic light armor so i'm
guessing<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:42.030> going<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.480> affect

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
guessing this is just going to affect

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.800 
guessing this is just going to affect
the<00:04:43.410> plus<00:04:44.340> damage<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.910> armor<00:04:45.210> i'm<00:04:45.420> guessing

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
the plus damage to armor i'm guessing

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.930 
the plus damage to armor i'm guessing
the<00:04:45.840> buyout<00:04:46.220> biological<00:04:47.220> sign<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.670> kalite

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the buyout biological sign and kalite

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.390 
the buyout biological sign and kalite
not<00:04:48.330> much<00:04:48.680> don't<00:04:49.680> know<00:04:49.800> much<00:04:50.010> about<00:04:50.040> these

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
not much don't know much about these

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.220 
not much don't know much about these
armor<00:04:50.700> types<00:04:50.940> but<00:04:51.180> i'm<00:04:51.330> guessing<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:51.990> going

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
armor types but i'm guessing it's going

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.950 
armor types but i'm guessing it's going
to<00:04:52.320> make<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> difference<00:04:53.190> for<00:04:53.670> units<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
to make a difference for units like the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.080 
to make a difference for units like the
stalker<00:04:55.230> up<00:04:55.500> here<00:04:55.710> which<00:04:55.950> do<00:04:56.190> bonus<00:04:56.640> damage<00:04:56.790> to

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
stalker up here which do bonus damage to

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.950 
stalker up here which do bonus damage to
armor<00:04:57.680> dark<00:04:58.680> shrine

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
armor dark shrine

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.260 
armor dark shrine
which<00:05:00.590> spit<00:05:00.919> so<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.160> allows<00:05:01.759> you<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.060> spit<00:05:02.240> out

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
which spit so it allows you to spit out

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.659 
which spit so it allows you to spit out

we got the baneling and this is going to

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.580

when they explode and minus five

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.670 
when they explode and minus five
compared<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.460> before<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:26.330> they<00:05:26.660> get<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.840> five

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
compared to before so they get a five

normal<00:05:32.990> damage<00:05:33.169> I<00:05:33.560> think<00:05:34.009> this<00:05:34.099> is<00:05:34.160> going<00:05:34.340> to

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
normal damage I think this is going to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.640 
normal damage I think this is going to
be<00:05:34.520> huge<00:05:35.060> shift<00:05:35.419> reserve<00:05:35.780> players<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.410> think

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
be huge shift reserve players I think

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.629 
be huge shift reserve players I think
