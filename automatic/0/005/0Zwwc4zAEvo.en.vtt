between the Motorola MOTO X and the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.740 
between the Motorola MOTO X and the
apple<00:00:10.769> iphone<00:00:11.130> 5<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.820> heard<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
apple iphone 5 we just heard about the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.410 
apple iphone 5 we just heard about the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
Moto X just announced very recently take

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.120 
Moto X just announced very recently take
a<00:00:15.480> quick<00:00:15.690> quick<00:00:15.960> look<00:00:16.199> at<00:00:16.320> these<00:00:16.410> devices<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
a quick quick look at these devices is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.470 
a quick quick look at these devices is
how<00:00:17.279> they<00:00:17.460> stack<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.730> against<00:00:18.210> one<00:00:18.449> another

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
how they stack up against one another

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260 
how they stack up against one another
now<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.590> terms<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> size<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.910> could<00:00:21.029> tell

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
now in terms of the size you could tell

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.450 
now in terms of the size you could tell
the<00:00:21.449> difference<00:00:21.480> here<00:00:21.930> almost<00:00:22.560> identical

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the difference here almost identical

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
the difference here almost identical
which<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> pretty<00:00:23.910> amazing<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> Moto<00:00:25.170> X

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
which is pretty amazing for the Moto X

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 
which is pretty amazing for the Moto X
considering<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> has<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.640> larger

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
considering that it has the larger

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.720 
considering that it has the larger
display<00:00:27.480> between<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.769> 4.7

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
display between the two it's a 4.7

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.520 
display between the two it's a 4.7
inches<00:00:30.060> AMOLED<00:00:30.750> display<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.790> 720p

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
inches AMOLED display it's a it's 720p

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.580 
inches AMOLED display it's a it's 720p
so<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.800> beats<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.700> iphone<00:00:36.270> 5<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.260> terms<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
so it beats out the iphone 5 in terms of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350 
so it beats out the iphone 5 in terms of
the<00:00:37.770> pure<00:00:37.980> resolution<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> iPhone<00:00:39.210> 5

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the pure resolution because the iPhone 5

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.190 
the pure resolution because the iPhone 5
has<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.570> resolution<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.290> 11<00:00:40.620> 36<00:00:41.010> x<00:00:41.190> 640<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.960> on

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
has a resolution of 11 36 x 640 and on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
has a resolution of 11 36 x 640 and on
top<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.710> almost<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.219> fantastic

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
top of that it's almost just fantastic

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.610 
top of that it's almost just fantastic
that<00:00:45.390> motor<00:00:45.690> role<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:45.930> been<00:00:45.960> able<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.410> make<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that motor role has been able to make a

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
that motor role has been able to make a
handset<00:00:47.190> even<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> larger<00:00:48.360> screen<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
handset even with the larger screen that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
handset even with the larger screen that
pretty<00:00:49.050> much<00:00:49.200> mimics<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.860> size<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
pretty much mimics the size of the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.330 
pretty much mimics the size of the
iphone<00:00:50.730> 5<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:52.170> form-fitting<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> natural

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
iphone 5 a very form-fitting and natural

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.819 
iphone 5 a very form-fitting and natural
we<00:00:54.000> definitely<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.449> how<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> Moto<00:00:55.379> X<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
we definitely like how the Moto X it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
we definitely like how the Moto X it
feels<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> hand<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.270> has<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> very

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
feels in the hand it just has a very

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860 
feels in the hand it just has a very
nice<00:00:58.199> ergonomic<00:00:58.670> feel<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> it<00:00:59.940> especially<00:01:00.359> due

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
nice ergonomic feel to it especially due

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
nice ergonomic feel to it especially due
to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.379> rounded<00:01:02.010> casing<00:01:03.000> whereas<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> iPhone

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to the rounded casing whereas the iPhone

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.200 
to the rounded casing whereas the iPhone
5<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.189> flat<00:01:05.610> around<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
5 is a little bit more flat around the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
5 is a little bit more flat around the
around<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
around the back here so it does make it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
around the back here so it does make it
a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.299> sharp<00:01:09.570> too<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> hold<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
a little bit sharp too when you hold it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
a little bit sharp too when you hold it
towards<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.280> materials<00:01:11.729> though<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> robbery

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
towards the materials though the robbery

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
towards the materials though the robbery
finish<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> nice<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.710> Moto<00:01:13.950> X<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.520> just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
finish is nice on the Moto X it just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
finish is nice on the Moto X it just
gives<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> nice<00:01:15.150> clean<00:01:15.540> clean<00:01:16.200> finish<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:17.009> a

composite material rubbery feel it's a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
composite material rubbery feel it's a
different<00:01:20.790> contrast<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> iphone<00:01:21.840> 5s<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

brushed<00:01:22.470> aluminum<00:01:22.890> casing<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.430> i<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.700> here

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
brushed aluminum casing now i have here

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
brushed aluminum casing now i have here
it's<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> decal<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.020> underneath<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's just a decal but underneath that of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's just a decal but underneath that of
course<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> brushed<00:01:27.210> aluminum

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
course is just that brushed aluminum

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
course is just that brushed aluminum
casing<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> ipod<00:01:28.680> still<00:01:28.920> exhibits<00:01:29.430> the
