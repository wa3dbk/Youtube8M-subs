00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Let's go and get a whole for you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.319
 short two gameplay is in particular 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.599
 is just such a fast so far new 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 player on the pack at 676 rule 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 I have almost all really 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.580
 made all the kids with ddr 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 Maybe I have the first ones 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 third cut out in the first 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 round goods and then the second or 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 It was not fast and easy 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 good to see and that is something else 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 my 66 day on with the bsr you can see 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500
 not all days so come is like 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 the gameplay I think have been with 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 the fans worried or because david 1 so 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.010
 she knows you know in kiss tricks 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.540
 Flat screens are shit though 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.700
 actually so worth dsn plackmeyer 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.079
 to let 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 and yes i just want a short thing 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.480
 Although addressing is as usual 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 six weeks, I believe something 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 I used to think five times in the past 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.750
 I'm much too big, that's what I get out of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.789
 we know it black ops 2 complete it 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 patched on xbox really play around now 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.539
 sales-I'd say I have better 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.309
 First of all, reason to quickly 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 after three weeks and the backups days 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.850
 pulled and that was completely it really was 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.559
 mÃ¼ller games i have with ours 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.040
 entire 16 6 and over all sons of bitches 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.200
 because one lb was tall with it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.210
 Minke whales as well as so will be discussed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 a little bit of skin really only makes it 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.650
 bullshit everywhere 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.080
 and for the large part on youtube death a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.840
 a bit caught what do you want next 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.939
 Great comes when big stars and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.290
 hoogland will of course have big there 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.909
 no one is aware of what 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.250
 exactly you want to see come out to large 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.869
 do you want to know who but who know 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.400
 now writes a family business away 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.420
 wanted to see what exactly here for you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 see simply does not describe now 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.189
 the comments yes I want gets 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.530
 move in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.140
 what exactly is actually in, for example, somehow 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.369
 certain websites say something like what they 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.350
 For example, when he says he wants to see 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.420
 I wanted to see the three of them, you say 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.159
 do you want to see you want to see? 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.619
 her solo is welcome no matter if 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.299
 support it was just not saying is 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.770
 more accurate and also tells me to best 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.210
 I told you somehow special is so 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.170
 maybe for claims like that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.049
 exactly say what they wanted to also 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.159
 Alone is then usually still 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.049
 not very clear what you want to see 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.340
 between black ops 2 says yes then yes 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.409
 anything can be possible that somehow 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.940
 this will be summer puzzle play 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.280
 but somehow so worth it with it 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.319
 clearly never been that something can be 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.969
 be that lucky 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.499
 nuclear free for all so have to 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.840
 I know exactly what you see 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:21.739
 can also swapping can be 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.780
 also in b2b security many walls 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.310
 I also write and write two 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.109
 I also know for sure about 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.939
 fly the three stars is with 2 watch 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.109
 but possible to know your opinion 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.569
 Every one of you really writes me 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.340
 that you are now looking at the rating below 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.469
 come leave what trains see 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.639
 want and see exactly what 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.400
 you can also write us as 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.439
 ideal highland but if we want 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.939
 can somehow write because if you 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.230
 we wanted to look like him 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.969
 gamble because it is more complete 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.950
 shit but can play better 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.159
 not simply lock is also a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.629
 completely new has been bachelor throughout 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.659
 So count car writes so remember what we are 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.609
 want to see wanted to compare exactly 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.180
 I then wanted to see myself from solo 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:05.959
 Immediately what it as a specialist of km2 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.340
 there was news in 2006 what is controlled 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.139
 I know I write it in the comments 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.219
 in the comments and that too 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.290
 bit exactly how to do it 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.750
 whether he definitely clegg of you that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.870
 money gets the option at the end of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.979
 ok on take off nothing together 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.259
 We will not forget coming here 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.669
 who could do 100 106 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.620
 At least I hope that this boxing 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.680
 once okay are only for a single 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.729
 but well and has come in there 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.840
 do not forget and do not rate 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.840
 forget under pressure
