actual rigging of the boat certain boats
are<00:01:27.189> rigged<00:01:27.399> with<00:01:27.610> jack<00:01:27.880> plates<00:01:28.240> as<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.630> boat

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
are rigged with jack plates as this boat

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.300 
are rigged with jack plates as this boat
is<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.409> that<00:01:29.799> makes<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.159> installation

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
is and that makes the installation

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.399 
is and that makes the installation
process<00:01:30.819> much<00:01:31.299> easier<00:01:31.330> because<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.170> jack

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
process much easier because the jack

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.499 
process much easier because the jack
plate<00:01:32.740> moves<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.490> motor<00:01:33.729> mount<00:01:34.000> further<00:01:34.330> away

plate moves the motor mount further away

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.449 
plate moves the motor mount further away
from<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.810> boat<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.259> provides<00:01:35.740> an<00:01:35.890> area<00:01:36.130> up

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
from the boat and provides an area up

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.370 
from the boat and provides an area up
under<00:01:36.819> the<00:01:37.030> jack<00:01:37.750> plate<00:01:38.020> where<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.259> can

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
under the jack plate where you can

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.039 
under the jack plate where you can
install<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:38.890> transducer<00:01:39.549> if<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.600> boat<00:01:40.840> does

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
install the transducer if a boat does

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.690

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
concerned that the trans side imaging

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.980 
concerned that the trans side imaging
