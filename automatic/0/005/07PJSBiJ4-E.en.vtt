difficult<00:01:28.990> i<00:01:29.350> had<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> kind<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.770> estimate

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
difficult i had a kind of estimate

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
difficult i had a kind of estimate
looking<00:01:30.729> at<00:01:30.850> landmarks<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.540> street<00:01:31.810> names

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
looking at landmarks and street names

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.679

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
where the n turn boundary might have

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.319 
where the n turn boundary might have
been<00:01:34.840> back<00:01:35.080> in<00:01:35.229> 1898<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.700> obviously<00:01:37.000> not<00:01:37.180> all

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
been back in 1898 and obviously not all

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.499 
been back in 1898 and obviously not all
of<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> roads<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:38.799> have<00:01:38.979> today<00:01:39.509> were

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
of the roads that we have today were

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.050 
of the roads that we have today were
there<00:01:40.720> on<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.960> maps<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:42.009> had<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.520> kind<00:01:42.729> of

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
there on the maps so I had to kind of

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.880 
there on the maps so I had to kind of
get<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.810> little<00:01:43.990> bit<00:01:44.259> where<00:01:44.409> they<00:01:44.530> might<00:01:44.680> have

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
get a little bit where they might have

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.140 
get a little bit where they might have
run<00:01:45.009> some<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.400> names<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.850> change

then<00:02:24.780> painted<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.500> cut<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.860> out<00:02:25.980> with

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
then painted a can be cut it out with

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.250 
then painted a can be cut it out with
the<00:02:26.190> scalpel<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.090> stick<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.480> onto<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.960> map

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the scalpel and I stick it onto the map

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830 
the scalpel and I stick it onto the map
and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.950> start<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.580> next<00:02:29.730> layer<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.630> so

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and then I start the next layer and so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.720 
and then I start the next layer and so
these<00:02:30.990> many<00:02:31.260> many<00:02:31.500> layers<00:02:31.740> build<00:02:32.280> up<00:02:32.460> behind

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
these many many layers build up behind

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.730 
these many many layers build up behind
the<00:02:32.910> map<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.900> me<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.290> kind<00:02:34.620> of

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the map and to me this is kind of

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.350 
the map and to me this is kind of
referencing<00:02:35.370> how<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.610> live<00:02:35.940> within<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
referencing how we live within the

geography<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:38.730> might<00:02:38.940> walk<00:02:39.120> down<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> street

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
geography we might walk down a street

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.660 
geography we might walk down a street
one<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.740> normally<00:02:41.190> go<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> an

large-scale psf

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.519 
large-scale psf
for<00:06:12.969> a<00:06:12.999> longer<00:06:13.179> period<00:06:13.419> of<00:06:13.599> time<00:06:13.659> that's<00:06:14.409> when

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
for a longer period of time that's when

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.230 
for a longer period of time that's when
I<00:06:14.589> devised<00:06:14.949> a<00:06:14.979> whole<00:06:15.309> idea<00:06:15.669> of<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:15.939> mapping

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
I devised a whole idea of the mapping

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.600 
I devised a whole idea of the mapping
projects<00:06:16.809> and<00:06:17.229> for<00:06:17.469> that<00:06:17.589> piece<00:06:17.860> actually

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
projects and for that piece actually

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.359 
projects and for that piece actually
called<00:06:19.059> paper<00:06:19.689> trail<00:06:20.050> 100<00:06:20.499> thousand<00:06:20.889> cuts<00:06:21.069> I

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:21.369 
called paper trail 100 thousand cuts I

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.339 
called paper trail 100 thousand cuts I
used<00:06:21.879> a<00:06:22.059> contemporary<00:06:22.749> map<00:06:22.899> of<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.110> whole<00:06:23.289> of

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
used a contemporary map of the whole of

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.559 
used a contemporary map of the whole of
the<00:06:23.589> borough<00:06:23.800> of<00:06:23.889> barnet<00:06:24.189> from<00:06:25.119> which<00:06:25.240> I<00:06:25.389> cried

the borough of barnet from which I cried

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:26.549 
the borough of barnet from which I cried
everything<00:06:25.869> away<00:06:25.959> and<00:06:26.199> that<00:06:26.259> was<00:06:26.379> a<00:06:26.409> much

00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:26.559 
everything away and that was a much

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.519 
everything away and that was a much
smaller<00:06:26.800> scale<00:06:27.009> map<00:06:27.399> so<00:06:27.990> it<00:06:28.990> was<00:06:29.139> very<00:06:29.379> very

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
smaller scale map so it was very very

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.199 
smaller scale map so it was very very
fine<00:06:29.860> intricate<00:06:30.520> sort<00:06:30.729> of<00:06:30.789> lace<00:06:30.969> like

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:33.339 
filigree that I ended up with it'll mean

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.010 
filigree that I ended up with it'll mean
many<00:06:33.550> many<00:06:33.639> hours<00:06:33.849> just<00:06:34.209> to<00:06:34.330> cut<00:06:34.509> that<00:06:34.689> fat

about<00:06:42.819> using<00:06:43.209> this<00:06:43.959> paper<00:06:44.259> and<00:06:44.499> the<00:06:44.559> loss<00:06:44.679> that

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:44.709 
about using this paper and the loss that

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.469 
about using this paper and the loss that
i<00:06:44.949> got<00:06:45.099> from<00:06:45.279> libraries<00:06:45.879> was<00:06:46.059> in<00:06:46.179> the<00:06:46.300> borough

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
i got from libraries was in the borough

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.040 
i got from libraries was in the borough
of<00:06:46.599> barnet<00:06:47.639> is<00:06:48.639> that<00:06:48.879> it's<00:06:49.059> obvious<00:06:49.449> recycling

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
of barnet is that it's obvious recycling

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.350 
of barnet is that it's obvious recycling
so<00:06:50.319> it<00:06:50.589> does<00:06:50.979> sort<00:06:51.279> of<00:06:51.369> highlight<00:06:51.699> an<00:06:51.879> element

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
so it does sort of highlight an element

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.889 
so it does sort of highlight an element
of<00:06:52.539> of<00:06:53.050> you<00:06:53.409> know<00:06:53.559> reuse<00:06:54.189> and<00:06:54.519> don't<00:06:54.699> waste<00:06:54.939> but

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
it's also the way it has little traces

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.209
