00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
researching I've been trying a few

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
researching I've been trying a few
different<00:00:32.669> things<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.210> can't<00:00:33.420> say<00:00:33.660> it's

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
different things I can't say it's

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.780 
different things I can't say it's
completely<00:00:34.620> resolved<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.760> am

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
completely resolved at all but I am

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.670 
completely resolved at all but I am
definitely<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.600> I'm<00:00:36.989> doing<00:00:37.320> okay

definitely you know I'm doing okay

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
definitely you know I'm doing okay
and<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.149> kind<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> continue<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> try

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and I just kind of continue to try

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.830 
and I just kind of continue to try
things<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.980> am<00:00:41.730> still<00:00:42.180> back<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> little

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
things out I am still back on a little

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.010 
things out I am still back on a little
small<00:00:43.440> dose<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.860> thyroid<00:00:44.399> medication<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
small dose of thyroid medication that

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
small dose of thyroid medication that
seems<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.649> helping<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.450> also

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
seems to be helping and I have also

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
seems to be helping and I have also
experimented<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.469> small<00:00:49.890> doses<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
experimented with small doses of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.420 
experimented with small doses of
cortisol<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.539> adrenals<00:00:52.280> sometimes<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
cortisol for my adrenals sometimes it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
cortisol for my adrenals sometimes it
seems<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> helps<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.360> times<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.989> seems

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
seems like it helps other times it seems

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
seems like it helps other times it seems
like<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> doesn't<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.109> sure

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
like it doesn't so I'm kind of not sure

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.910 
like it doesn't so I'm kind of not sure
on<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> front<00:00:59.370> yet<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.109> also<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.379> cortisol

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
on that front yet and also with cortisol

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.850 
on that front yet and also with cortisol
I<00:01:02.280> did<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.660> increase<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.379> weight<00:01:04.619> as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I did have an increase in my weight as

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.700 
I did have an increase in my weight as
soon<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.339> started<00:01:05.700> taking<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.180> cortisol

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
soon as I started taking the cortisol

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.870 
soon as I started taking the cortisol
which<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.740> calm<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> even<00:01:08.549> though<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> was

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
which is calm and even though it was

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
which is calm and even though it was
taking<00:01:09.180> small<00:01:09.479> doses<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> causes

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
taking small doses I do think it causes

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.420 
taking small doses I do think it causes
some<00:01:11.640> water<00:01:11.850> retention<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.130> also<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> can

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
some water retention and also it can

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.450 
some water retention and also it can
cause<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.820> body<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> store<00:01:15.330> fat<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:17.070> think

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
cause your body to store fat I think

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.899 
cause your body to store fat I think
around<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:18.060> belly<00:01:18.240> area<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.909> anyway

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
around in your belly area so anyway

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820 
around in your belly area so anyway
everything's<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.509> experiment<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
