once again the more volume you give it
you<00:02:00.030> start<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.509> expose<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.200> fact<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you start to expose the fact that the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.039 
you start to expose the fact that the
hair<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.950> fine<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.939> high<00:02:03.119> density<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.840> wear

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
hair is fine the high density can wear

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.190 
hair is fine the high density can wear
their<00:02:04.229> hair<00:02:04.380> longer

Oh density they're better off shorter I
hope<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.570> helps<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.229> keep<00:02:08.619> the
