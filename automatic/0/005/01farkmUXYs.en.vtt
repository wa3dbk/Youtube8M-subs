00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.410 
thought I'd be driving I'm driving not
very<00:03:20.810> far<00:03:21.110> number<00:03:22.070> two<00:03:22.310> that's<00:03:22.580> one<00:03:22.910> goal<00:03:23.180> my

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
very far number two that's one goal my

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.540 
very far number two that's one goal my
second<00:03:23.870> goal<00:03:24.050> was<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.769> make<00:03:24.830> everybody<00:03:25.459> proud

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
to go for football and I think we moved

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.270 
to go for football and I think we moved
forward<00:03:29.750> on<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.050> but<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.040> don't<00:03:31.160> think

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
forward on that but I don't think

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.550 
forward on that but I don't think
anybody<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.910> room<00:03:32.150> satisfied<00:03:32.810> with<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.260> and

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
anybody in room satisfied with that and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.979 
anybody in room satisfied with that and
so<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.220> got<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.580> truly<00:03:34.970> move<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.330> forward<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.810> got

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
so I got to truly move it forward I got

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.890 
so I got to truly move it forward I got
