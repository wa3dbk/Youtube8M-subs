00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
film but gray characters always stick

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.470

like<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.319> town<00:03:04.590> was<00:03:04.739> very<00:03:04.799> clean<00:03:05.430> he<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.330> bad

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
like so town was very clean he was a bad

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
like so town was very clean he was a bad
guy<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.870> he<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.049> bad<00:03:07.530> guy<00:03:07.560> yeah<00:03:08.100> okay<00:03:08.580> you're

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.970 
a bad bad guy yeah I think I would be
probably<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.980> blend<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.760> both<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.359> think<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.739> deal

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
probably a blend of both I think to deal

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.500 
probably a blend of both I think to deal
with<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> world<00:03:17.459> today<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.450> be

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
with the world today you got to be

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.800 
with the world today you got to be
slightly<00:03:18.720> devious<00:03:19.609> if<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:21.030> good<00:03:21.239> if<00:03:21.630> you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
slightly devious if you do good if you

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.890 
slightly devious if you do good if you
do<00:03:22.019> nice<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.859> squeaky<00:03:23.160> clean<00:03:23.840> people<00:03:24.840> who

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900

step<00:03:25.109> all<00:03:25.290> over<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.859> think<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.430> need<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.880> be

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
step all over you I think you need to be

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.030 
step all over you I think you need to be
prepared<00:03:27.329> for<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:27.510> nice<00:03:27.959> guys<00:03:28.290> finish<00:03:28.650> last

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
prepared for that nice guys finish last

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.470 
prepared for that nice guys finish last
so<00:03:29.310> moving<00:03:30.060> some<00:03:30.480> time<00:03:30.660> got<00:03:30.840> short<00:03:31.940> as<00:03:32.940> long<00:03:33.359> as

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
so moving some time got short as long as

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.400 
so moving some time got short as long as
you<00:03:33.540> don't<00:03:33.630> hurt<00:03:33.840> anyone

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
you don't hurt anyone

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.680 
you don't hurt anyone
yeah<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.709> think<00:03:34.859> there<00:03:35.850> has<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.209> part<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
yeah I think there has to be part of you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.110 
yeah I think there has to be part of you
that<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.109> know<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:37.950> no-nonsense<00:03:38.640> part<00:03:39.060> if

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
that you know that no-nonsense part if

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.670 
that you know that no-nonsense part if
someone<00:03:39.390> messes<00:03:39.630> with<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.440> probably

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
someone messes with you you probably

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.289 
someone messes with you you probably
shouldn't<00:03:41.130> take<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.310> lying<00:03:41.549> down<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:42.060> think

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
shouldn't take it lying down I think

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.210 
shouldn't take it lying down I think
that's<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:42.959> mantra<00:03:43.350> for<00:03:43.590> this

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
that's kind of mantra for this

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.970 
that's kind of mantra for this
generation<00:03:44.730> at<00:03:44.910> least
