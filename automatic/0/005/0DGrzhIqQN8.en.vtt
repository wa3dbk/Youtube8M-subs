once the sheets are linked that's it but

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.220 
once the sheets are linked that's it but
it'll<00:05:02.880> work<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.630> whole<00:05:03.720> time<00:05:03.750> until<00:05:04.140> you

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
reboot so it takes much longer this way

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.360 
reboot so it takes much longer this way
is<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.720> lot<00:05:09.990> quicker<00:05:10.290> your<00:05:10.770> she'll<00:05:10.950> show<00:05:11.220> up

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370
