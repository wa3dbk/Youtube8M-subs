00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:18.970 

spear<00:02:03.710> where<00:02:03.860> though<00:02:03.980> we<00:02:04.160> are<00:02:04.310> first

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.220 

okay<00:02:19.849> some<00:02:20.450> fields

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.850 

just<00:02:37.629> maybe<00:02:37.780> doing<00:02:37.989> films<00:02:38.409> and<00:02:38.590> okay<00:02:38.799> I'm

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
just maybe doing films and okay I'm

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.059 
just maybe doing films and okay I'm
gonna<00:02:38.980> put<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.909> antenna<00:02:41.370> away<00:02:43.739> from<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.829> plan

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
gonna put the antenna away from the plan

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.619 
gonna put the antenna away from the plan
so<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.430> signal<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.760> going<00:02:45.879> through<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.450> body

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
so the signal is going through the body

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:55.720 
so the signal is going through the body
not<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:48.150> that's<00:02:49.150> right<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.569> way

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.770 

even<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:18.980> little<00:04:19.190> bit<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.550> flaps<00:04:19.940> just<00:04:20.540> so<00:04:20.720> you

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
even a little bit of flaps just so you

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:32.559 
even a little bit of flaps just so you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.490 

I'm<00:04:39.030> not<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.210> complete<00:04:39.420> chicken<00:04:40.230> but<00:04:40.440> at

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
I'm not a complete chicken but at

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.610 
I'm not a complete chicken but at
the<00:04:40.560> same<00:04:40.770> time<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.040> just<00:04:41.340> want<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.520> be<00:04:41.580> careful

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.590 

it's<00:04:49.340> not<00:04:49.460> bad

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.570 

and<00:04:54.140> that's<00:04:54.320> not<00:04:54.470> good

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.249 

so<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.120> don't<00:05:00.360> know<00:05:00.569> I'm<00:05:00.810> getting<00:05:01.169> that

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
so I don't know I'm getting that

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.809 
so I don't know I'm getting that
interference<00:05:01.889> but<00:05:02.129> I'm<00:05:02.250> going<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> bring<00:05:02.639> our

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
interference but I'm going to bring our

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:13.740 
interference but I'm going to bring our
home

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.020 

could<00:05:14.380> be<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.500> loose<00:05:14.740> connection<00:05:14.820> who<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.910> hell

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
could be a loose connection who the hell

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.590 
could be a loose connection who the hell
knows<00:05:16.210> right<00:05:16.890> but<00:05:17.890> no<00:05:18.700> point<00:05:18.970> in<00:05:19.060> taking<00:05:19.210> any

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
knows right but no point in taking any

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:27.790 
knows right but no point in taking any
risks<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.770> we're<00:05:20.920> going<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.190> bring<00:05:21.280> her<00:05:21.400> in

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.080 

fairly<00:05:28.610> close<00:05:28.849> in<00:05:29.180> now<00:05:29.419> again<00:05:30.259> see

I'm wondering if right where my craw

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.219 
I'm wondering if right where my craw
star<00:05:40.909> is<00:05:41.000> pointing<00:05:41.240> through<00:05:41.659> I'm<00:05:41.900> wondering

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.460 
star is pointing through I'm wondering
if<00:05:42.349> it's<00:05:42.849> this<00:05:43.849> is<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.090> damn<00:05:44.449> chain<00:05:44.900> link<00:05:45.169> fence

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
if it's this is a damn chain link fence

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.559 
if it's this is a damn chain link fence
or<00:05:45.710> something<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:46.220> know<00:05:46.250> what<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.460> mean<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:47.509> I

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
or something you know what I mean so I

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.420 
or something you know what I mean so I
could<00:05:47.810> have<00:05:47.900> basically<00:05:48.590> just<00:05:48.860> picked<00:05:49.129> a<00:05:49.280> bad

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
could have basically just picked a bad

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.170 
could have basically just picked a bad
spot<00:05:49.879> for<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.240> cross<00:05:50.479> here<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.229> also<00:05:51.620> a

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
spot for the cross here that is also a

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.129 
spot for the cross here that is also a
very<00:05:53.180> good<00:05:53.539> chance<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.830> I'm<00:05:55.250> going<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:56.139> next

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
very good chance so I'm going to next

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.450 
very good chance so I'm going to next
time<00:05:57.289> I<00:05:57.409> built<00:05:57.590> with<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.740> crosshair<00:05:58.190> just

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
time I built with the crosshair just

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.080 
time I built with the crosshair just
past<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.270> fence<00:05:59.509> my<00:05:59.960> name<00:06:00.169> is<00:06:00.879> obviously<00:06:01.879> this

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
past the fence my name is obviously this

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.790 
past the fence my name is obviously this
isn't<00:06:02.270> something<00:06:02.659> we<00:06:03.169> want<00:06:03.379> to<00:06:03.469> be<00:06:03.560> dealing

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
isn't something we want to be dealing

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.159 
isn't something we want to be dealing
with<00:06:04.159> so<00:06:04.550> I'm<00:06:04.940> just<00:06:05.120> going<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.330> burger<00:06:07.960> pop<00:06:08.960> in

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169

the<00:06:09.229> fresh<00:06:09.500> battery<00:06:10.069> and<00:06:10.759> maybe<00:06:11.270> move<00:06:11.780> the

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
the fresh battery and maybe move the

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:35.270 
the fresh battery and maybe move the
crosshair<00:06:12.440> bit

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:53.090 

and<00:06:35.850> we<00:06:36.150> are<00:06:36.300> there<00:06:36.620> landed
