00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 today name two weird 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.300
 that I have mixed feelings for 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.890
 what 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.840
 I have the opportunity to go out again 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.660
 of the country 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.390
 to a great institution like it's sandwich 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 of doctor 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.349
 I have an opportunity to direct that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.439
 all the opportunities at the same time 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.449
 but when they have to take advantage of the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.369
 opportunities when they are concrete 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.100
 I think there are two you will find everything 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.769
 the feelings 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.260
 and one begins to evaluate and express 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.320
 many things about the things that can 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.410
 get good for my life for life 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.180
 of my families 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.220
 but also all things charge 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.130
 back low ballasted an institution 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.260
 giant that always opened the doors for me 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.820
 leaving this little one that begin the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.180
 minor visions and I have a lot of memories 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.329
 of that 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.550
 that I had the opportunity to stay 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.960
 champion in the minor divisions of 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.970
 scorer then I'm going 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.180
 a little boring because he could not achieve 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.220
 that was a measured expression to get 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 to Medellin and being a champion 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 goal scorer 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.130
 but I know it's just beginning I'm very 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.050
 young I will have the opportunity to see 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.690
 to the team 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.060
 to go back to make goals to come out champion 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.150
 I know I hope that in some 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.790
 opportunity when I return have have 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
