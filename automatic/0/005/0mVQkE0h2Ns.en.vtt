00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
whenever you get on no matter if it's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
whenever you get on no matter if it's
the<00:00:57.000> first<00:00:57.239> hour<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> double<00:00:57.809> XP<00:00:58.079> weekend<00:00:58.379> or

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the first hour of double XP weekend or

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
the first hour of double XP weekend or
the<00:00:58.800> last<00:00:59.219> hour<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.690> guess<00:01:00.989> last<00:01:01.289> hour<00:01:01.530> would

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the last hour or I guess last hour would

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.229 
the last hour or I guess last hour would
it<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.100> make<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.550> sense<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.030> would

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it would make more sense it would

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
it would make more sense it would
actually<00:01:03.660> affect<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.010> starts<00:01:05.369> off

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
actually affect you but it starts off

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.530 
actually affect you but it starts off
the<00:01:06.150> first<00:01:06.390> hour<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> play<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:07.670> 2.8<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the first hour you play is at 2.8 so

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
the first hour you play is at 2.8 so
it's<00:01:09.750> double<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.260> almost<00:01:10.500> triple<00:01:10.979> present

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it's double it's almost triple present

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's double it's almost triple present
and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> goes<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.840> over<00:01:13.530> 10<00:01:13.770> hours<00:01:13.950> from

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and then it goes down over 10 hours from

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
and then it goes down over 10 hours from
two<00:01:14.640> point<00:01:14.939> no<00:01:15.299> 2.7<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.170> point<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.619> point

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
two point no 2.7 that point two point

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.840 
two point no 2.7 that point two point
eight<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.400> bad<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:19.170> starts<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
eight of my bad it starts at that it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.960 
eight of my bad it starts at that it
goes<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:22.799> point<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.310> which<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.580> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
goes down to one point one which is just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
goes down to one point one which is just
ten<00:01:24.509> percent<00:01:24.840> extra<00:01:25.170> than<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> would

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
ten percent extra than you would

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.749
