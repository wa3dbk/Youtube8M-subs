00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.150
 good texture is WHAT you guys have a good 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.000
 texture that I made there based on the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.609
 texture default ok this map here to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.369
 Who's asking is very handsome. 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.600

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.359
 time I do not know how to talk about the new 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.130
 sorry but I know you think 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.649
 is the following on the basis of lack of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.360
 some blocks to August in the edition of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.210
 afternoon kiyoto can drink enough 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 people have enough here to land stones and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.170
 I'll show you later, then 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
 Let's start with the items here that are 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.430
 default or even from a distance this is just 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 for you to see that everything is giving everything gives 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.199
 default then he would have announced that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.460
 armor also as I told the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.629
 default 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.220
 You see everything is in default so let's 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.350
 here to pick up the swords and sword of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.600
 wood than the stone sword that was 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.439
 diamond- shaped iron is sword 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.270
 gold lock is I recorded this now goes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.880
 to be from Rio very long lost in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 we are here to see the ores 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.570
 I made this one that I'm here to highlight 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 night three women why not 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.540

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 and that's why I'm not 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.180
 is there so let's go let's go now 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 for the biona but you can see that the biome 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.770
 of land 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.990
 Okay, I'll get you a land here to 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.080
 you will see 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.020
 certain land of an edited in it so 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.290
 how I edited the grass here tonight 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.280
 have the grass left the original snow 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.760
 unicredit 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.760
 but the rest I edited everything ok - it's 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:20.350
 now here neither for the lesser boy then 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.880
 here it is from criticism that the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.370
 private to enchanted 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.370
 This rock was killed. 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.519
 get this bombing malls and 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:40.980
 this is critical and the two 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:44.040
 You do not have anything here, you can stay. 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.430
 in the lapa it does not disturb anything 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.150
 take in the water that is all of the standard can 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.980
 see here are the mushrooms yesterday one 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:02.790
 creativity does not get the texture team 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:09.959
 that in the case of positions that the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.669
 same pattern is not as diverse as having a 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.310
 a little hopscotch and more 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:17.730
 I think it's cool, I think it's cool. 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.439
 emm eff stylish meals here I 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.340
 I left all the same sure I did not 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:25.340
 I never changed anything from default 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:42.739
 I think there's something left and the 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:42.739
 iron and wood diamond items 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:04:40.889
 are the right items 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:40.889
 then the bogeyman armor and the swords 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.610
 and here is Bahian team from the left of 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.920
 show here is a hot boat underneath you 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.900
 You can see beauty there is hope 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.270
 I would have liked it personally if you liked it more. 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.760
 want to explain there are favorites 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.200
 also on the channel and writing cannabis 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.870
 with the inscription also that she died 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.640
 much in editing videos or textures as 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.640
 This spoke hug and futile.
