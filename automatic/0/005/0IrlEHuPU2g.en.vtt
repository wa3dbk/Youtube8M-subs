00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
am really bad at sewing machines take

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.920 
am really bad at sewing machines take
that<00:02:51.630> add<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.050> little<00:02:52.530> cold<00:02:52.800> medicine<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.930> you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that add a little cold medicine and you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.390 
that add a little cold medicine and you
know<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.290> might<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.650> more<00:02:55.830> difficult<00:02:56.070> than

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
know that might be more difficult than

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.199 
know that might be more difficult than
it<00:02:56.640> needed<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.940> be

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
it needed to be

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.610

so once you've sewed those two things

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860 
so once you've sewed those two things
together<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.459> are<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.180> turn<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.600> inside

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
together you are going to turn it inside

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.760 
together you are going to turn it inside
out<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.340> iron<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.300> flat<00:03:03.660> now<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.380> have

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
out and then iron it flat now you have

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.509 
out and then iron it flat now you have
basically<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.820> long<00:03:06.239> tube<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:08.130> part

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
basically a long tube and this part

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.840 
basically a long tube and this part
should<00:03:08.790> be<00:03:08.850> open<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.769> part<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.280> all<00:03:11.459> sewn

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
should be open and this part is all sewn

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.330 
should be open and this part is all sewn
and<00:03:12.269> ironed<00:03:12.720> flat<00:03:13.050> we're<00:03:13.470> going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> close<00:03:13.950> one

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
and ironed flat we're going to close one

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.260 
and ironed flat we're going to close one
end<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:14.940> we

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
end so that we
