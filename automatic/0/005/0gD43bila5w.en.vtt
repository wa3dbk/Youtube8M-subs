00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:11.192
 - Ready? - Yes. 

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.435
 Just don't let me fall. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.565
 Never. 

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:26.304
 I, Edward Cullen, take you, Bella Swan. 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.864
 In luck and misfortune ... 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.886
 - I will love you ... - ... and honor. 

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:36.321
 Until death do us part. 

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:43.233
 I'll remember you like that. Pink cheeks, heart beat. 

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:46.251
 I thought it would be easy to say goodbye to you after all our farewells. 

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.801
 18. NOVEMBRA 

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.483
 FOREVER 

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:07.533
 Last night was the best night of my whole existence. 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.466
 IT IS BEGINNING 

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:19.485
 That is not possible. 

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:28.001
 Your body cannot normally accept the fetus. It's too strong and growing fast. 

00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:30.169
 He kills her from within. 

00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:32.844
 Your heart will fail before childbirth. 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.933
 It's your fault! 

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:37.321
 I can't see Bella's future any more. 

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:42.017
 We don't know what creature they spawned. We have to protect the tribe until it's too late. 

00:01:42.552 --> 00:01:46.761
 Now you are their enemy. Sam will kill you without hesitation. 

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:49.722
 Every hour sucks your life out of you. 

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:52.004
 - I'll have to live without you. - You have to reconcile with reality. 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.737
 You're not giving me a choice. 

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.750
 - Are you ready? They're after Bella. - She won't even touch her. 

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.166
 You can only reach her through my corpse. 

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:19.392
 Bella! Come on! 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.665
