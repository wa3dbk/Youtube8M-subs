00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.310 

all<00:00:18.240> right<00:00:18.360> so<00:00:18.540> if<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.689> want<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> get<00:00:19.110> to<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
all right so if you want to get to the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.170 
all right so if you want to get to the
more<00:00:19.500> evil<00:00:20.040> side<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.310> things<00:00:20.730> you're<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
more evil side of things you're going to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
more evil side of things you're going to
need<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.450> know<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.810> harmonic<00:00:22.260> minor<00:00:22.439> they're

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
need to know you harmonic minor they're

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.740 
need to know you harmonic minor they're
probably<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> easiest<00:00:24.000> way<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> get<00:00:24.450> started

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
probably the easiest way to get started

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.920 
probably the easiest way to get started
is<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.200> do<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.860> linear<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:27.030> is<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> fancy<00:00:27.570> ass

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
is to do it linear which is a fancy ass

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.070 
is to do it linear which is a fancy ass
way<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.289> saying<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.880> neck<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.360> string

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
way of saying up the neck on one string

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.900 
way of saying up the neck on one string
so<00:00:31.440> here<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.710> check<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.129> it's<00:00:32.669> actually

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
so here it is check it out it's actually

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.299 
so here it is check it out it's actually
kind<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.150> cool<00:00:33.330> sounding<00:00:33.660> scale<00:00:34.309> it's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
kind of a cool sounding scale it's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
kind of a cool sounding scale it's
really<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.230> apparent<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.379> someone's<00:00:37.739> using

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
really a apparent when someone's using

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
really a apparent when someone's using
it<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.220> can<00:00:38.250> hear<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.910> hear<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.360> Slayer

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it you can hear you hear a lot in Slayer

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
it you can hear you hear a lot in Slayer
music<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.080> stuff<00:00:40.400> it's<00:00:41.400> basically<00:00:41.519> just<00:00:41.879> like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
music and stuff it's basically just like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.759 
music and stuff it's basically just like
a<00:00:42.449> harmonic<00:00:42.839> minor<00:00:42.870> scale<00:00:43.320> would<00:00:43.470> look<00:00:43.620> like

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
a harmonic minor scale would look like

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.070 
a harmonic minor scale would look like
this<00:00:43.949> a<00:00:44.010> harmonic<00:00:44.670> minor<00:00:44.790> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.089> like<00:00:48.080> you're

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
this a harmonic minor if you like you're

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.460 
this a harmonic minor if you like you're
raising<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.530> last<00:00:49.739> note<00:00:49.949> we're<00:00:50.129> usually

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.340 

now<00:00:56.220> what<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> want<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> try<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.230> make

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
now what you want to try to do to make

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
now what you want to try to do to make
this<00:00:58.500> easier<00:00:58.650> on<00:00:58.920> yourself<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.970> at<00:01:00.060> least<00:01:00.210> for

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this easier on yourself or at least for

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:14.180 
this easier on yourself or at least for
me<00:01:04.280> learning<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.460> line<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:13.620> can<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.830> away<00:01:13.950> with

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
me learning a line you can get away with

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.910 
me learning a line you can get away with
linear<00:01:14.550> oolitic<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.240> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.830> know

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
linear oolitic so just kind of you know

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:38.770 
linear oolitic so just kind of you know
picking<00:01:17.720> alternate<00:01:18.720> picking

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.060 

so<00:01:39.780> I'm<00:01:39.870> good<00:01:39.990> exercises<00:01:40.440> just<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.830> take<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so I'm good exercises just to take a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:02:06.280 
so I'm good exercises just to take a
groups<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.400> eight

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.310 

and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.410> you<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.620> throw<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.900> like

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
and then you can throw and if you like

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.310 
and then you can throw and if you like
let's<00:02:10.470> say<00:02:10.560> you're<00:02:10.680> just<00:02:10.800> pedal<00:02:11.130> on<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> note<00:02:12.320> I

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
let's say you're just pedal on a note I

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.150 
let's say you're just pedal on a note I
got<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.400> pounds<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:18.770> just<00:02:19.770> make<00:02:19.980> these

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
got to have pounds well just make these

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.130 
got to have pounds well just make these
little<00:02:20.400> drops<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.940> there<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:21.990> don't

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
little drops in there you know I don't

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.180 
little drops in there you know I don't
know<00:02:22.200> how<00:02:22.260> many<00:02:22.410> times<00:02:22.620> I'm<00:02:22.770> hitting<00:02:22.980> stuff

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
know how many times I'm hitting stuff

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.430 
know how many times I'm hitting stuff
I'm<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.490> kind<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.700> winging<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.480> I'm<00:02:25.080> making

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
I'm just kind of winging it I'm making

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:39.910 
I'm just kind of winging it I'm making
it<00:02:25.620> some<00:02:25.740> kind<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.980> cool<00:02:26.160> stuff<00:02:26.580> going<00:02:26.640> on

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.170 

loads<00:02:40.920> yen<00:02:41.159> strong<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.780> want<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.019> be<00:02:43.079> like

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.610 

what<00:02:48.180> I'll<00:02:48.299> do<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.629> take<00:02:48.689> 84<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.469> try<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
what I'll do is take 84 and to try to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
what I'll do is take 84 and to try to
alternate<00:02:50.010> like

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.890 

you're<00:03:01.640> just<00:03:01.730> gonna<00:03:01.880> jump<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.390> up<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.690> coming

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
you're just gonna jump it up and coming

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.820 
you're just gonna jump it up and coming
back

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.750 

my<00:03:11.830> head<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> don't<00:03:12.189> know<00:03:12.340> what<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.549> hell<00:03:12.670> I'm

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
my head I don't know what the hell I'm

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.970 
my head I don't know what the hell I'm
doing
