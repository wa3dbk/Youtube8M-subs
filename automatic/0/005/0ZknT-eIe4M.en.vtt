I'd<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> video<00:00:07.379> now<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.610> FoodSaver

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
I'd do a video now with the FoodSaver

I'd do a video now with the FoodSaver
type<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.870> vacuum<00:00:10.320> sealer<00:00:10.800> when<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.580> put<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> bag

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
type of vacuum sealer when you put a bag

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.020 
type of vacuum sealer when you put a bag
into<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.809> slot<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.440> bar<00:00:13.889> drops<00:00:14.250> down<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
into that slot a bar drops down and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.240 
into that slot a bar drops down and
clamps<00:00:15.360> down<00:00:15.420> onto<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> bag<00:00:16.260> then<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> vacuum

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
clamps down onto the bag then the vacuum

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.720 
clamps down onto the bag then the vacuum
is<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.029> back<00:00:18.420> side<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.320> bar<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
is on the back side of the bar and in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.910 
is on the back side of the bar and in
order<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> pull<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> vacuum<00:00:21.810> past<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.650> bar<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
order to pull a vacuum past that bar you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800 
order to pull a vacuum past that bar you
have<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.550> those<00:00:23.699> special<00:00:24.210> channel<00:00:24.600> tight

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
have to have those special channel tight

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
have to have those special channel tight
bags<00:00:26.060> with<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.510> little<00:00:27.869> vacuum<00:00:28.320> sealer<00:00:29.090> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
bags with the little vacuum sealer the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.819 
bags with the little vacuum sealer the
vacuum<00:00:30.720> ends<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:32.239> front<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> bar<00:00:33.899> so

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
vacuum ends up in front of the bar so

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.889 
vacuum ends up in front of the bar so
you<00:00:34.890> don't<00:00:35.340> need<00:00:35.610> channel<00:00:36.090> bags<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.630> use

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you don't need channel bags you can use

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.889 
you don't need channel bags you can use
any<00:00:37.110> type<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.620> bag<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.180> capable<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
any type of bag that is capable of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
any type of bag that is capable of
holding<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.379> vacuum<00:00:40.910> that's<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.180> say<00:00:42.360> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
holding a vacuum that's to say you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.139 
holding a vacuum that's to say you
couldn't<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> sandwich<00:00:43.860> bag<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
couldn't use a sandwich bag because a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.380 
couldn't use a sandwich bag because a
sandwich<00:00:45.899> bag<00:00:46.110> won't<00:00:46.500> hold<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.890> vacuum<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.059> on

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sandwich bag won't hold a vacuum but on

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
sandwich bag won't hold a vacuum but on
the<00:00:49.050> bags<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.559> cheese<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.340> buy<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the bags of cheese that you buy in the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
the bags of cheese that you buy in the
store<00:00:50.850> those<00:00:51.780> bags<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.350> capable<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> holding

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
store those bags are capable of holding

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.630 
store those bags are capable of holding
a<00:00:53.430> vacuum<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.379> when<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> buy<00:00:55.649> those<00:00:55.980> I'll<00:00:56.399> cut

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
a vacuum so when I buy those I'll cut

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.110 
a vacuum so when I buy those I'll cut
that<00:00:56.789> Ziploc<00:00:57.390> edge<00:00:57.960> off<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.829> put<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> bag

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that Ziploc edge off of it put the bag

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
that Ziploc edge off of it put the bag
of<00:01:00.149> cheese<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.530> vacuum<00:01:01.949> seal<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
of cheese in here and I vacuum seal it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
of cheese in here and I vacuum seal it
and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.670> put<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.239> freezer<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.989> I'll

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and then put it in the freezer so I'll

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.460 
and then put it in the freezer so I'll
show<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.830> how<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.280> works

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
show you how this works

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.070 
show you how this works
I'm<00:01:07.470> vacuum<00:01:08.460> sealing<00:01:08.729> soap<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.720> soap

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
I'm vacuum sealing soap because soap

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.050 
I'm vacuum sealing soap because soap
tends<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> evaporate<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
tends to evaporate so what you do is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
tends to evaporate so what you do is
pull<00:01:15.960> pull<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> nozzle<00:01:17.900> put<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> bag<00:01:19.229> on

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
pull pull out the nozzle put the bag on

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.649 
pull pull out the nozzle put the bag on
there<00:01:20.030> make<00:01:21.110> make<00:01:22.110> sure<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.830> smooth

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:43.010 

closed<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:29.450> turn<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> machine

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.130 

unlock<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.340> it's<00:01:45.550> vacuum-sealed

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.170 

as<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.350> can<00:01:50.500> see<00:01:50.710> these<00:01:51.370> these<00:01:51.430> are<00:01:51.910> quart

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
as you can see these these are quart

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.200 
as you can see these these are quart
bags<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.690> cut<00:01:52.930> down<00:01:53.580> I've<00:01:54.580> used<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.090> other

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
bags that I cut down I've used the other

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.000 
bags that I cut down I've used the other
half<00:01:55.480> or<00:01:55.660> something<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.200> don't<00:01:56.380> remember<00:01:56.560> what

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
half or something I don't remember what

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.060 
half or something I don't remember what
but<00:01:57.310> they're<00:01:57.550> just<00:01:57.790> regular<00:01:58.410> clear<00:01:59.410> bags<00:01:59.800> and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
but they're just regular clear bags and

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.830 
but they're just regular clear bags and
there's<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.430> much<00:02:00.580> cheaper<00:02:01.120> than<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
there's so much cheaper than the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.669 
there's so much cheaper than the
FoodSaver<00:02:02.320> bag<00:02:06.360> quart<00:02:07.360> size<00:02:07.630> bag<00:02:07.990> that's<00:02:08.500> what

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679

eight centerpiece and I've bought the
machine<00:02:36.700> from<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.480> website<00:02:38.260> called<00:02:38.620> sorban

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
machine from a website called sorban

machine from a website called sorban
systems<00:02:39.850> machine<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.959> believe<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.640> $99<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:42.940> you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
systems machine I believe is $99 if you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.360 
systems machine I believe is $99 if you
buy<00:02:43.269> $50<00:02:44.110> worth<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.380> bags<00:02:44.590> then<00:02:44.950> they'll<00:02:45.160> take

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
buy $50 worth of bags then they'll take

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.479 
buy $50 worth of bags then they'll take
$15<00:02:46.239> off<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> machine<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.739> ends<00:02:47.860> up<00:02:48.010> 85

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
$15 off the machine so it ends up 85

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.000 
$15 off the machine so it ends up 85
dollars<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.540> bag<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.959> save<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.470> much<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
dollars the bag I save so much on the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.400 
dollars the bag I save so much on the
bags<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.610> was<00:02:52.120> worthwhile<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.959> buy<00:02:53.350> this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
bags it was worthwhile to buy this

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.509 
bags it was worthwhile to buy this
little<00:02:54.250> machine<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.830> vacuum<00:02:57.010> sealer

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
little machine this little vacuum sealer

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.880 
little machine this little vacuum sealer
can<00:02:57.820> be<00:02:57.970> kind<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.300> tricky<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.959> work<00:02:59.200> with<00:02:59.260> and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
can be kind of tricky to work with and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.520 
can be kind of tricky to work with and
it<00:03:00.070> takes<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.400> bit<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.610> practice<00:03:00.880> if<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:02.260> food

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
it takes a bit of practice if the food

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.280 
it takes a bit of practice if the food
is<00:03:02.800> too<00:03:03.040> far<00:03:03.370> away<00:03:03.700> from<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.120> nozzle<00:03:04.330> then<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
is too far away from the nozzle then the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.530 
is too far away from the nozzle then the
bag<00:03:05.530> will<00:03:05.800> collapse<00:03:06.160> around<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.760> nozzle<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
bag will collapse around the nozzle and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.699 
bag will collapse around the nozzle and
I<00:03:08.380> won't<00:03:08.709> pull<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> vacuum<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:11.380> need<00:03:11.560> to

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
I won't pull a vacuum so you need to

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.640 
I won't pull a vacuum so you need to
keep<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.160> food<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.730> closer<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.690> novel<00:03:14.230> if

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
keep the food up closer to the novel if

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.550 
keep the food up closer to the novel if
it<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:15.360> if<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.510> try<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.750> vacuum<00:03:17.200> seal<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
it was if if I try to vacuum seal it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.229 
it was if if I try to vacuum seal it
with<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.709> food<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.310> far<00:03:18.610> away<00:03:18.760> from<00:03:18.940> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
with the food that far away from the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.550 
with the food that far away from the
nozzle<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.959> wouldn't<00:03:20.500> work<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.989> what<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.350> want

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
nozzle it wouldn't work so what you want

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.920 
nozzle it wouldn't work so what you want
to<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.160> try<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.519> push<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.060> food<00:03:25.269> up<00:03:25.540> closer

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
to do is try to push the food up closer

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.890 
to do is try to push the food up closer
to<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.350> nozzle<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.700> bag<00:03:27.970> will<00:03:28.390> be

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
to the nozzle so that the bag will be

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.530 
to the nozzle so that the bag will be
able<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.230> collapse<00:03:29.620> upon<00:03:29.950> itself<00:03:30.420> let's<00:03:31.420> see

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
able to collapse upon itself let's see

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:58.680 
able to collapse upon itself let's see
if<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.720> can<00:03:31.870> do<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.140> with<00:03:32.320> one<00:03:32.350> hand

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.570 

it<00:03:59.690> works<00:03:59.900> fine<00:04:00.260> but<00:04:00.560> if<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.830> if<00:04:01.040> those<00:04:01.220> beans

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
it works fine but if that if those beans

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.610 
it works fine but if that if those beans
had<00:04:01.849> have<00:04:01.970> been<00:04:02.150> too<00:04:02.510> far<00:04:02.870> away<00:04:03.019> from<00:04:03.230> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
had have been too far away from the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.369 
had have been too far away from the
nozzle<00:04:04.099> it<00:04:04.519> wouldn't<00:04:05.209> have<00:04:05.360> worked<00:04:06.019> properly

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
nozzle it wouldn't have worked properly

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.650 
nozzle it wouldn't have worked properly
it<00:04:07.099> just<00:04:07.340> takes<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.670> little<00:04:07.790> practice<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.630> can

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
it just takes a little practice it can

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.850 
it just takes a little practice it can
be<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> little<00:04:08.959> bit<00:04:09.110> frustrating<00:04:09.680> at<00:04:09.830> first

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
be a little bit frustrating at first

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.390 
be a little bit frustrating at first
with<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.400> machine<00:04:10.819> but<00:04:11.920> I've<00:04:12.920> been<00:04:13.190> real

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
with this machine but I've been real

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.569 
with this machine but I've been real
happy<00:04:13.760> with<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:17.709> some<00:04:18.709> foods<00:04:18.979> have<00:04:19.280> sharp

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
happy with it some foods have sharp

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.540 
happy with it some foods have sharp
edges<00:04:19.880> like<00:04:20.479> corn<00:04:21.139> or<00:04:21.410> rice<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:22.220> when<00:04:22.430> you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
edges like corn or rice and when you

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.760 
edges like corn or rice and when you
vacuum<00:04:22.729> seal<00:04:22.970> them<00:04:23.570> sometimes<00:04:24.560> they'll

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
vacuum seal them sometimes they'll

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.680 
vacuum seal them sometimes they'll
puncture<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.520> bag<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:26.090> you'll<00:04:26.180> lose<00:04:26.450> your

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
puncture the bag and you'll lose your

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.320 
puncture the bag and you'll lose your
seal<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.830> happens<00:04:28.220> whether<00:04:28.639> using<00:04:29.000> food

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
seal that happens whether using food

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.280 
seal that happens whether using food
saver<00:04:29.570> bags<00:04:29.900> or<00:04:30.260> these<00:04:30.560> bags<00:04:32.020> I've<00:04:33.020> heard

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
saver bags or these bags I've heard

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.710 
saver bags or these bags I've heard
people<00:04:33.500> suggest<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.669> could<00:04:34.820> put<00:04:35.090> the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
people suggest that you could put the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.029 
people suggest that you could put the
food<00:04:35.990> inside<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:37.100> lunch<00:04:37.669> bags<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.450> then<00:04:39.200> put

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
food inside of lunch bags and then put

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.279 
food inside of lunch bags and then put
the<00:04:40.160> lunch<00:04:40.370> bag<00:04:40.639> inside<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.150> plastic<00:04:41.930> bag<00:04:42.080> and

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
the lunch bag inside the plastic bag and

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.469 
the lunch bag inside the plastic bag and
vacuum<00:04:42.680> seal<00:04:42.950> it<00:04:42.979> but<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.550> found<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
vacuum seal it but I found that the

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.450 
vacuum seal it but I found that the
lunch<00:04:44.720> bags<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.380> sharp<00:04:45.650> edges<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:46.160> their<00:04:46.310> own

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
lunch bags have sharp edges of their own

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.120 
lunch bags have sharp edges of their own
that<00:04:46.820> will<00:04:47.150> puncture<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.600> bag<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.770> my

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
that will puncture the bag so my

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.300 
that will puncture the bag so my
solution<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.090> problem<00:04:50.660> has<00:04:51.289> is<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:52.070> fill

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
solution to the problem has is to fill

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.719 
solution to the problem has is to fill
socks<00:04:52.780> with<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.960> food<00:04:54.260> and<00:04:54.590> then<00:04:55.310> vacuum

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
socks with the food and then vacuum

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.260 
socks with the food and then vacuum
sealing<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.600> sock<00:04:57.200> full<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.530> food<00:04:57.979> and<00:04:58.970> here's

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
sealing the sock full of food and here's

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.260 
sealing the sock full of food and here's
a<00:04:59.770> bag<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.800> corn<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.520> vacuum<00:05:01.970> sealed

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
a bag of corn that I vacuum sealed

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.850 
a bag of corn that I vacuum sealed
inside<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:02.960> sock<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.750> sock<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.350> always

put the bag on the nozzle and I'll take

put the bag on the nozzle and I'll take
a<00:06:00.409> strip<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:00.979> a<00:06:01.099> paper<00:06:01.370> towel

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.750 

position<00:06:21.070> it<00:06:21.220> right<00:06:21.490> below<00:06:21.730> the<00:06:22.030> nozzle<00:06:23.760> this

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
position it right below the nozzle this

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.880 
position it right below the nozzle this
keeps<00:06:25.030> the<00:06:25.240> bag<00:06:25.450> from<00:06:25.750> collapsing<00:06:26.380> around<00:06:26.740> the

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
keeps the bag from collapsing around the

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.160 
keeps the bag from collapsing around the
nozzle<00:06:27.070> if<00:06:27.610> it<00:06:28.270> does<00:06:28.480> that<00:06:28.720> then<00:06:28.840> it<00:06:28.990> won't

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
nozzle if it does that then it won't

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.080 
nozzle if it does that then it won't
pull<00:06:29.440> any<00:06:29.470> more<00:06:29.890> air<00:06:32.400> this<00:06:33.400> allows<00:06:33.790> you<00:06:34.060> to

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
pull any more air this allows you to

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.210 
pull any more air this allows you to
keep<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.390> flour<00:06:34.780> a<00:06:34.930> safe<00:06:35.320> distance<00:06:35.830> from<00:06:36.040> the

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
keep the flour a safe distance from the

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.280 
keep the flour a safe distance from the
nozzle<00:06:36.670> if<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:37.000> flour<00:06:37.270> is<00:06:37.570> up<00:06:37.810> at<00:06:37.990> the<00:06:38.110> nozzle

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
nozzle if the flour is up at the nozzle

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:50.299 
nozzle if the flour is up at the nozzle
it<00:06:38.680> will<00:06:38.800> be<00:06:38.920> sucked<00:06:39.220> through<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.580> machine

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:50.309 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.429 

basically<00:06:51.089> what<00:06:51.389> you're<00:06:51.569> doing<00:06:51.959> is<00:06:52.139> creating

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:52.439 
basically what you're doing is creating

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.930 
basically what you're doing is creating
a<00:06:52.829> channel<00:06:53.339> with<00:06:54.269> the

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
a channel with the

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:18.450 
a channel with the
paper<00:06:56.570> towel

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.170 

there<00:07:19.460> you<00:07:19.580> have<00:07:19.789> it

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
there you have it

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:28.209 
there you have it
I<00:07:20.210> can<00:07:21.169> still<00:07:21.409> flower<00:07:26.560> so<00:07:27.560> that's<00:07:27.949> how<00:07:28.159> the

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:28.219 
I can still flower so that's how the

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:40.260 
I can still flower so that's how the
little<00:07:28.699> vacuum<00:07:29.060> sealer<00:07:29.479> works<00:07:29.780> hope<00:07:30.620> it<00:07:30.770> helps

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.270 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.330 

you
