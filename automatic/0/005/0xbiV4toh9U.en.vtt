as<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.329> guys<00:04:01.479> know<00:04:01.510> they<00:04:01.959> moved<00:04:02.229> the<00:04:02.349> field

as you guys know they moved the field
goal<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.549> believe<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.629> 15<00:04:05.169> or<00:04:05.409> the<00:04:06.220> 10

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
goal to I believe like the 15 or the 10

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.490 
goal to I believe like the 15 or the 10
I<00:04:06.489> think<00:04:06.879> it<00:04:06.970> was<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.090> 15-yard<00:04:07.629> oh<00:04:07.690> noes<00:04:07.900> just<00:04:08.409> to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
I think it was a 15-yard oh noes just to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.170 
I think it was a 15-yard oh noes just to
make<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.650> more<00:04:08.739> challenging<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.609> because

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
make it more challenging and because

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.270 
make it more challenging and because
people<00:04:10.479> thought<00:04:10.659> when<00:04:11.169> it<00:04:11.319> was<00:04:11.470> on<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:12.069> close

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
people thought when it was on that close

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.559 
people thought when it was on that close
to<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.519> touchdown<00:04:12.909> it<00:04:13.120> wasn't<00:04:13.389> really<00:04:13.479> that

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
to the touchdown it wasn't really that

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.409 
to the touchdown it wasn't really that
that<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.769> challenging<00:04:15.699> so<00:04:15.940> now<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> lot<00:04:16.389> of
