00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.499
 Hello, we are again recording today 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:05.420
 I'll show you how to build 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.729
 here is such a code lock 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.049
 his build sock 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.069
 but as you can see it is quite ambitious 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.800
 so let's get started 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.390
 it is built first 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.390
 in the keypad itself 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.999
 then you can arrange red 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.870
 under customer number 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.670
 Stalin household without 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 books hardly excerpts 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.740
 accelerator 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.030
 will be again 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.500
 for calves authority 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 then the basics of the old 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.760
 in disassembly 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.570
 honestly by consumers 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.750
 new job 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.780
 a number of consumers 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090
 Let's do 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.350
 in this pledge 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.810
 killing two numbers 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 I don't want to eat 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.130
 next we arrange 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 in all forms 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.180
 we will use for programming 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.120
 our year in the cis 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 with flight range 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.410
 we spend on top of them all 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 in order stone 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.439
 by the way today will be used 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.260
 memory cell and stones added in 1 4 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
 2 oak of 1 3 2 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.329
 small 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.879
 4 by 3 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.879
 behind a post on both sides 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.299
 we need to do 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.299
 proper treatment itself 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.309
 so here 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.309
 percent 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.139
 growth 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.399
 We are with you and so repeat without 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:56.829
 delays 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.829
 we raise 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.989
 repeat the place in order not to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.389
 crosses did not intersect growth 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.279
 signal 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.409
 and supplied by its own cell 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.119
 of memory 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.879
 here it is here we have a decrease in demand 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.219
 for this dividing line 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.429
 memorable 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.709
 and from this side we do exactly 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.709
 I know 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.279
 lithuania malta monastery 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.369
 I really want to say at once 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.349
 mechanism 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.509
 I do not remember life 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.489
 further we just 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 so descended the signal 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.329
 with both of these 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.279
 stable chips 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.349
 with the help of the consumer 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.149
 as you saw maybe you just tory 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.149
 fans memory with work 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.389
 commandant create immediately put with 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.389
 you 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.439
 and now we do 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.990
 two years 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.990
 contact tel 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.490
 under this done perform 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.699
 from here already 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.779
 somoni final 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.129
 ask grams 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.849
 as you can see close 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:00.869
 now you can program 

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:04.259
 our own code 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.259
 in order to program the role of livestock 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.599
 let's be the year 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.770
 one more 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.059
 we leave 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.919
 just one fact 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.360
 and further 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.240
 from 8 only to Kiev 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.259
 so that it does not drop at 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.370
 pressed 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.729
 our channel 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.729
 here we leave 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.969
 and here from the post I realized that he should 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.830
 just be completely different 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.830
 check how it works 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.860
 scientists would have another button 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.879
 one our market 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.679
 ask signal door book 

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.080
 opened up 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.270
 director gignac toulouse 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.160
 Well, that's all basically a client that I 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.960
 wanted to show 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.960
 with you papers and if you liked 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:11.300
 we see these rushes 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.020
 signed several times that person
