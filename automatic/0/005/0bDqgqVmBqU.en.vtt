worked<00:01:25.310> great<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.820> just<00:01:26.030> put<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.210> on<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.510> I<00:01:26.630> ran

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
worked great I just put it on and I ran

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.420 
worked great I just put it on and I ran
perfectly<00:01:27.170> fine<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.830> tuned<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.400> I

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
perfectly fine and then I tuned it and I

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.430 
perfectly fine and then I tuned it and I
gained<00:01:28.760> even<00:01:28.880> more<00:01:29.210> than<00:01:29.810> what<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:29.930> wanted<00:01:30.110> you

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
gained even more than what I wanted you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.310 
gained even more than what I wanted you
know<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:31.010> was<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.190> great<00:01:31.369> investment

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.260 

it's<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.410> original<00:01:40.770> down<00:01:40.920> sheet<00:01:41.310> yeah<00:01:42.120> I<00:01:42.150> was

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's my original down sheet yeah I was

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.230 
it's my original down sheet yeah I was
like<00:01:42.360> 2025<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> boost<00:01:44.370> plots<00:01:44.610> changed<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.150> was

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
like 2025 the boost plots changed I was

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.400 
like 2025 the boost plots changed I was
able<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.540> add<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.260> boost

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
able to add a little bit more boost

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.860 
able to add a little bit more boost
earlier<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:48.060> add<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.570> more<00:01:48.720> pressure

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
earlier I can add a little more pressure

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.820 
earlier I can add a little more pressure
because<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.260> had<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.470> bit<00:01:49.620> of<00:01:49.680> pressure

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
because I had a little bit of pressure

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.330 
because I had a little bit of pressure
drop<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:51.660> torch<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.800> needed<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> be

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
drop the torch there but I needed to be

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.660 
drop the torch there but I needed to be
so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.300> still<00:01:55.110> make<00:01:55.260> full<00:01:55.470> spool<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.920> stock<00:01:56.160> RPM

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so I still make full spool and stock RPM

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.969 
so I still make full spool and stock RPM
pretty<00:01:56.940> much<00:01:57.150> with<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.140> term<00:01:58.350> also

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
pretty much with this term also

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.429 
pretty much with this term also
major<00:02:00.610> major<00:02:01.000> issues<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.600> know<00:02:01.689> my<00:02:02.140> motor<00:02:02.350> is

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
major major issues you know my motor is

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.440 
major major issues you know my motor is
stock<00:02:02.799> if<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.610> were<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.880> build<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.299> was

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
stock if I were to build it I was

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.969 
stock if I were to build it I was
sucking<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:04.990> manifold<00:02:05.439> just<00:02:05.649> because<00:02:05.829> it's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
sucking this manifold just because it's

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.009 
sucking this manifold just because it's
a<00:02:06.039> great<00:02:06.219> manifold<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.820> works<00:02:07.030> well<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.539> a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
a great manifold it works well with a

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.419 
a great manifold it works well with a
