00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
jump can't make it not spreading what he

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.260 
jump can't make it not spreading what he
made<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> show<00:00:54.239> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I'll try making the same job jump see

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
I'll try making the same job jump see
I'm<00:01:12.960> still<00:01:13.170> sprinting<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> basic

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I'm still sprinting so here the basic

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
I'm still sprinting so here the basic
enter<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> machine<00:01:19.610> you'll<00:01:20.610> need<00:01:20.820> ice

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
enter to the machine you'll need ice

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
enter to the machine you'll need ice
you'll<00:01:21.960> need<00:01:22.140> fence<00:01:22.439> posts<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.920> you'll<00:01:23.040> need

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you'll need fence posts and you'll need

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
you'll need fence posts and you'll need
pressure<00:01:23.340> plates<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> sticky<00:01:24.689> pistons<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
pressure plates and sticky pistons to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
pressure plates and sticky pistons to
make<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.119> if<00:01:27.119> you're<00:01:27.210> wondering<00:01:27.240> why

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
make this and if you're wondering why

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.149 
make this and if you're wondering why
you<00:01:27.869> need<00:01:28.080> ice<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.500> believe<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.829> something<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you need ice I believe it's something to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.069 
you need ice I believe it's something to
do<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> my<00:01:30.509> cup<00:01:30.720> characters

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
do with the way that my cup characters

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.499 
do with the way that my cup characters
move<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.560> friction<00:01:32.030> because<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> try

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
move and friction because if you try

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
move and friction because if you try
some<00:01:34.259> shifting<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.220> normal<00:01:35.640> blocks<00:01:35.850> instead

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
some shifting in normal blocks instead

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.120 
some shifting in normal blocks instead
of<00:01:36.270> ice<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.630> doesn't<00:01:36.869> work<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:38.119> get<00:01:39.119> stuck

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
of ice it doesn't work you get stuck

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
of ice it doesn't work you get stuck
okay<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> show<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> how<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> build

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.520 
bye to house is a bit wonky for whatever
reason<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.369> block<00:02:03.549> there<00:02:03.700> easy<00:02:04.119> peasy<00:02:04.539> okay

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
reason put a block there easy peasy okay

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.830 
reason put a block there easy peasy okay
so<00:02:05.590> first<00:02:06.189> I'll<00:02:06.490> need<00:02:06.549> two<00:02:07.270> sticky<00:02:07.569> pistons

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
so first I'll need two sticky pistons

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.119 
so first I'll need two sticky pistons
here<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> stack<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.440> two<00:02:11.440> by<00:02:11.590> two<00:02:11.650> sticky

Redstone to the back Pistons with a
repeater<00:02:58.599> that's<00:02:59.079> on<00:02:59.319> two<00:02:59.650> tix<00:02:59.859> two<00:03:00.400> tix<00:03:01.170> same

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
repeater that's on two tix two tix same

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.170 
repeater that's on two tix two tix same
thing<00:03:02.349> on<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.530> other<00:03:02.560> side<00:03:04.019> two<00:03:05.019> tix<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.180> then

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
thing on the other side two tix and then

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.000 
thing on the other side two tix and then
thread<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.660> Redstone<00:03:08.290> through<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.889> hits

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
thread the Redstone through so it hits

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.080 
thread the Redstone through so it hits
these<00:03:09.220> Pistons<00:03:09.700> too<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:15.069> now<00:03:15.609> you<00:03:15.669> got<00:03:16.060> a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
these Pistons too and now you got a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.729 
these Pistons too and now you got a
working<00:03:16.769> stair<00:03:17.769> machine<00:03:18.250> thing<00:03:19.590> there<00:03:20.590> we<00:03:20.650> go

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
working stair machine thing there we go

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.129 
working stair machine thing there we go
and<00:03:21.400> again<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.239> sprint<00:03:22.569> up<00:03:22.750> them<00:03:22.900> I'm

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
and again you can sprint up them I'm

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:29.300 
and again you can sprint up them I'm
sprinting<00:03:23.470> right<00:03:23.709> now<00:03:23.829> oh<00:03:25.049> that's<00:03:26.049> weird

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.170 

sprint

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.949 

that's<00:03:33.900> interesting<00:03:35.359> okay<00:03:36.359> well<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> believe

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
that's interesting okay well I believe

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.539 
that's interesting okay well I believe
the<00:03:37.109> reason<00:03:37.349> that<00:03:37.620> these<00:03:37.739> things<00:03:38.010> work<00:03:38.340> is

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the reason that these things work is

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.149 
the reason that these things work is
that<00:03:38.719> if<00:03:39.719> you<00:03:39.900> guys<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.230> fence<00:03:40.500> posts<00:03:40.950> aren't

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
that if you guys know fence posts aren't

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.759 
that if you guys know fence posts aren't
one<00:03:41.640> blocked<00:03:41.879> all<00:03:42.120> their<00:03:42.750> 1.5<00:03:43.260> blocks<00:03:43.379> tall

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
one blocked all their 1.5 blocks tall

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.830 
one blocked all their 1.5 blocks tall
mean<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.849> can't<00:03:45.060> jump<00:03:45.209> on<00:03:45.329> them<00:03:45.540> they

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
mean that you can't jump on them they

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.890 
mean that you can't jump on them they
take<00:03:46.140> up<00:03:46.250> more<00:03:47.250> than<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:47.489> block<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.969> but

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
take up more than one block and but

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.420 
take up more than one block and but
pressure<00:03:49.109> plates<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.650> think<00:03:49.980> something<00:03:50.310> about

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
pressure plates I think something about

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.910 
pressure plates I think something about
the<00:03:50.639> contact<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.900> conway<00:03:52.469> that<00:03:52.620> my<00:03:52.709> craft

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
the contact the conway that my craft

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.589 
the contact the conway that my craft
deluxe<00:03:53.219> detects<00:03:53.730> collisions<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.389> pressure

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
deluxe detects collisions with pressure

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.289 
deluxe detects collisions with pressure
plates<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.200> fence<00:03:55.439> posts<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.150> making<00:03:57.150> sense

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
plates and fence posts is making sense

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.729 
plates and fence posts is making sense
and<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.599> can<00:03:57.750> step<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.079> edge<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
and you can step on the edge and it

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.800 
and you can step on the edge and it
detects<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.370> attacks<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.269> stepping<00:04:00.599> on<00:04:00.689> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
detects the attacks you stepping on the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.069 
detects the attacks you stepping on the
pressure<00:04:00.959> plate<00:04:01.079> which<00:04:01.769> pushes<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.250> up<00:04:03.079> and

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
pressure plate which pushes you up and

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.960 
pressure plate which pushes you up and
because<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.920> way<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.340> these<00:04:05.519> Pistons

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
because of the way that these Pistons

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.729 
because of the way that these Pistons
push<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.299> up<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.840> can't<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.200> stop<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
push you up you can't just stop in the

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.949 
push you up you can't just stop in the
middle<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.040> elevator<00:04:08.569> notice<00:04:09.569> if<00:04:09.689> I<00:04:09.780> try

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
middle of the elevator notice if I try

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.909 
middle of the elevator notice if I try
stopping<00:04:10.260> here<00:04:11.120> I'll<00:04:12.120> get<00:04:12.209> stuck<00:04:12.650> so<00:04:13.650> you're

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
stopping here I'll get stuck so you're

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.830 
stopping here I'll get stuck so you're
gonna<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.250> walk<00:04:14.400> up<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.669> entire<00:04:14.879> way

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.409 

okay<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.680> there's<00:04:19.829> some<00:04:20.190> stairs<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.299> can

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
okay so there's some stairs that you can

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.749 
okay so there's some stairs that you can
sprint<00:04:21.599> up<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.900> thank<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.830> sigh<00:04:23.250> wizard<00:04:23.580> for
