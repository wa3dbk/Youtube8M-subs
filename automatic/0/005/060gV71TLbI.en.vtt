00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
air piste and of course right now we're

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.270 
air piste and of course right now we're
using<00:00:30.670> this<00:00:31.060> piston<00:00:31.630> on<00:00:31.780> hydrogen<00:00:32.259> what<00:00:33.160> we're

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
using this piston on hydrogen what we're

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.430 
using this piston on hydrogen what we're
gonna<00:00:33.370> do<00:00:33.610> is<00:00:33.820> immerse<00:00:34.270> these<00:00:34.539> this<00:00:35.140> metal

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
gonna do is immerse these this metal

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.160 
gonna do is immerse these this metal
hydride<00:00:35.770> into<00:00:36.480> warm<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.720> cold<00:00:37.900> water

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.729 
hydride into warm and cold water
actually<00:00:38.500> this<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:38.890> warm<00:00:39.520> water<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:41.200> is<00:00:41.440> cold

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
actually this is warm water this is cold

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.950 
actually this is warm water this is cold
water<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.790> what<00:00:43.060> we're<00:00:43.210> gonna<00:00:43.329> do<00:00:43.600> is<00:00:43.780> when

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
water and what we're gonna do is when

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.200 
water and what we're gonna do is when
you<00:00:44.079> immerse<00:00:44.710> it<00:00:44.829> into<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.190> warm<00:00:45.430> water<00:00:45.489> the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
you immerse it into the warm water the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.920 
you immerse it into the warm water the
piston<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:46.600> going<00:00:46.810> to<00:00:47.430> extend<00:00:48.690> immerse<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.840> in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
piston is going to extend immerse it in

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.120 
piston is going to extend immerse it in
cold<00:00:50.170> water<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:51.190> will<00:00:51.370> retract<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.920> going

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
cold water it will retract and I'm going

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.130 
cold water it will retract and I'm going
to<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.370> again<00:00:54.610> here<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.630> this<00:00:55.750> time<00:00:55.809> going

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
to do it again here but this time going

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.520 
to do it again here but this time going
to<00:00:56.200> try<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.410> hold<00:00:56.590> this<00:00:56.800> piston<00:00:57.219> back<00:00:57.460> I<00:00:58.530> can't

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
to try to hold this piston back I can't

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.430 
to try to hold this piston back I can't
hold<00:00:59.680> it<00:00:59.829> back<00:01:00.600> we're<00:01:01.600> gonna<00:01:01.690> put<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:02.020> back<00:01:02.200> in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
hold it back we're gonna put it back in

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.100 
hold it back we're gonna put it back in
every<00:01:02.860> tract<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.329> the<00:01:04.540> interesting<00:01:04.930> thing

because<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:22.509> other<00:01:22.869> technologies<00:01:23.590> if<00:01:23.859> they

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
because of other technologies if they

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.019 
because of other technologies if they
use<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> freon<00:01:24.759> or<00:01:26.039> mallika<00:01:27.039> fluid<00:01:27.520> liquid<00:01:27.670> gas

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:28.029 
use a freon or mallika fluid liquid gas

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.539 
use a freon or mallika fluid liquid gas
you're<00:01:28.959> going<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.289> get<00:01:29.439> condensation<00:01:30.189> of<00:01:30.310> that

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
you're going to get condensation of that

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.660 
you're going to get condensation of that
gas<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:31.719> cold<00:01:32.200> piston<00:01:32.649> you'd<00:01:33.189> have<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.490> keep

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
gas on a cold piston you'd have to keep

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.249 
gas on a cold piston you'd have to keep
the<00:01:33.789> piston<00:01:34.149> hot<00:01:34.359> in<00:01:34.569> order<00:01:34.749> to<00:01:34.810> make<00:01:34.929> this

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
the piston hot in order to make this

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.929 
the piston hot in order to make this
heat<00:01:35.499> engine<00:01:35.679> work<00:01:35.979> with<00:01:36.159> other<00:01:36.310> technologies

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
heat engine work with other technologies

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.730 
heat engine work with other technologies
here<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.359> don't<00:01:37.509> have<00:01:37.659> to<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:37.929> that<00:01:38.109> because

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
here you don't have to do that because

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.160 
here you don't have to do that because
metal<00:01:39.219> hydride<00:01:39.549> leaves<00:01:40.299> their<00:01:40.810> hydrogen

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
metal hydride leaves their hydrogen

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.169 
metal hydride leaves their hydrogen
leaves<00:01:41.469> in<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.649> hide<00:01:41.829> right<00:01:41.859> here<00:01:42.069> as<00:01:42.459> a<00:01:42.819> gas

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
leaves in the hide right here as a gas

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.359 
leaves in the hide right here as a gas
comes<00:01:43.959> in<00:01:44.079> contact<00:01:44.259> with<00:01:44.560> cold<00:01:44.740> surfaces<00:01:45.189> and

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
comes in contact with cold surfaces and

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.089 
comes in contact with cold surfaces and
doesn't<00:01:45.639> condense<00:01:45.969> so<00:01:46.929> this<00:01:47.139> is<00:01:47.319> really

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
doesn't condense so this is really

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:50.669 
doesn't condense so this is really
breakthrough<00:01:48.549> technology<00:01:49.389> converting<00:01:49.899> the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
breakthrough technology converting the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.359 
breakthrough technology converting the
thermal<00:01:51.039> energy<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.459> hot<00:01:51.789> water<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:53.369> work

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
thermal energy of hot water into work

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.249 
thermal energy of hot water into work
movement<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.329> course<00:01:55.569> that's<00:01:55.779> one<00:01:56.020> step

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
movement and of course that's one step

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.260 
movement and of course that's one step
away<00:01:56.380> from<00:01:56.529> taking<00:01:56.979> work<00:01:57.369> movement<00:01:57.880> and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
away from taking work movement and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.999 
away from taking work movement and
converting<00:01:58.959> into<00:01:59.109> electric<00:01:59.590> power<00:01:59.619> when

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
converting into electric power when

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.029 
converting into electric power when
someone<00:02:00.279> thought<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.549> video<00:02:00.849> show<00:02:02.039> the

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
someone thought of a video show the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.559 
someone thought of a video show the
exciting<00:02:03.489> thing<00:02:03.639> about<00:02:03.669> this<00:02:03.969> technology<00:02:04.299> is

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
exciting thing about this technology is

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.200
