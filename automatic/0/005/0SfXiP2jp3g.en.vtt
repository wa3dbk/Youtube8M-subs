00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's cute I like it I'm a little bit OCD

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.890 
it's cute I like it I'm a little bit OCD
so<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.590> have<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.920> be<00:01:31.040> careful<00:01:31.250> with<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.600> amount

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
so I have to be careful with the amount

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.350 
so I have to be careful with the amount
that<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.200> track<00:01:33.590> but<00:01:34.430> what<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:34.880> does<00:01:35.060> for<00:01:35.090> me

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
that I track but what this does for me

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.149 
that I track but what this does for me
has<00:01:35.510> helped<00:01:35.720> me<00:01:35.869> not<00:01:36.020> snack<00:01:36.470> which<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:36.950> big

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
has helped me not snack which is a big

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.310 
has helped me not snack which is a big
problem<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.640> me<00:01:37.820> because<00:01:38.299> when<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.869> have<00:01:38.900> to

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
problem for me because when you have to

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.480 
problem for me because when you have to
write<00:01:39.470> down<00:01:39.680> everything<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:40.130> you're<00:01:40.340> eating

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
write down everything that you're eating

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.859 
write down everything that you're eating
and<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.880> calories<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.510> what<00:01:41.600> you're<00:01:41.720> eating

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
and the calories and what you're eating

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.310 
and the calories and what you're eating
it<00:01:42.229> makes<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> little<00:01:43.340> more<00:01:43.490> conscious<00:01:43.970> and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
it makes you a little more conscious and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.620 
it makes you a little more conscious and

definitely<00:04:05.769> is<00:04:06.129> no<00:04:06.370> meal<00:04:06.909> or<00:04:07.269> anything<00:04:07.629> it's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
definitely is no meal or anything it's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.770 
definitely is no meal or anything it's
50<00:04:08.290> calories<00:04:08.500> it's<00:04:09.180> basically<00:04:10.180> nothing<00:04:10.629> and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
50 calories it's basically nothing and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.569 
50 calories it's basically nothing and
it<00:04:11.319> also<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.799> really<00:04:11.949> good<00:04:12.189> with<00:04:12.220> peanut

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
it also is really good with peanut

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:13.740 
it also is really good with peanut
butter<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:12.939> instead<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.299> putting<00:04:13.389> peanut

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
butter so instead of putting peanut

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.469 
butter so instead of putting peanut
butter<00:04:13.989> on<00:04:14.049> bread<00:04:14.489> uh<00:04:15.489> it's<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.359> good

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
butter on bread uh it's a good

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.939 
butter on bread uh it's a good
alternative<00:04:16.599> a<00:04:17.139> lot<00:04:17.530> less<00:04:17.709> calories

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
alternative a lot less calories

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.560 
alternative a lot less calories
especially<00:04:18.609> because<00:04:18.759> peanut<00:04:19.060> butter<00:04:19.209> alone

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
especially because peanut butter alone

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.360 
especially because peanut butter alone
although<00:04:19.900> it's<00:04:20.169> healthy<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.620> very<00:04:20.889> caloric

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
although it's healthy is very caloric

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.550 
although it's healthy is very caloric
and<00:04:21.789> that's<00:04:22.000> everything<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.750> told<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:23.469> it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
and that's everything I told you it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.750 
and that's everything I told you it
would<00:04:23.650> be<00:04:23.680> quick<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.099> those<00:04:24.279> are<00:04:24.400> basically

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
would be quick but those are basically

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.470 
would be quick but those are basically
