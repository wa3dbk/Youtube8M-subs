00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.729
 Normal tag 19 continuous shooting speed is about this, but it is good to add a little 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.480
 Let's do even mdl as well eh 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.500
 Hmm 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:26.340
 As these two strikes are quite disliked, the demand capacity is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:29.430
 The following approximately 119 can be done by putting on GungHo and alternating the departure sprint mdl 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.930
 Departure reload space Lind without the first hand is 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.950
 Repeat in order 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:40.030
 in Star Swap Weapon Ejection Motion and Initial Ejection Motion 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:45.450
 Cancel and eventually reduce time to weapon exchange 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 It is easy to press the triangle button twice while holding the grenade button 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.670
 If you have something with slow withdrawal such as launcher or heavy shield , you want to remember 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 is not it 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.650
 Let's see how fast the weapon exchange will be with instance up 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.650
 When this was normally exchange 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.680
 Flexible piece wow ah ah ah ah

 dj 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.900
 Let's do the extraction time with the most xmg 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.350
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.460

 The 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:41.189
 It's amazing how fast it is The pattern that the guy who was running around so far jumped 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.189
 If you do it from the time you bring it back to xmg, you will definitely see it 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:52.510
 Capture the enemy in front by holding the b Zhu Museum in practical Strikes Back Thein Sutasa 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.830
 Still low for no more fight in the spike drone 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.250
