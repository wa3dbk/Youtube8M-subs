 chicken like this so go home 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.960
 show how to get this result 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 we start by taking care of the marinade 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.020
 so we 'll add all no 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:13.130
 liquids simply to the whole 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.789

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.789

 we will add sesame oil 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.950
 now we will add the aroma of 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:34.060
 fish 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:39.740
 the ouch note the ginger saubade 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.200
 we end with trail 10 and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.200
 Sesame seeds 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.600
 so we're going to move all that for 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 to have something homogeneous I 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 finish by adding some salt to or 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.179
 two rounds of pepper mill 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.249
 the chilli that I cut into tiny 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.899
 pieces as well as coriander that I have 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.600
 chiseled I kept a branch part of 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.100
 decoration 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 we stir all that I'll book my 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.140
 marinade in the fridge while I 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.900
 take care of the chicken so we will use it 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.540
 for this recipe that the little part 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.590
 which contains two waters and we pestle 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.500
 so we will start by separating them and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.459
 then no we reserve them we will use them 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 later for another recipe 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.350
 little further the mexican or 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.300
 something else 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.420
 so now how are we going to proceed 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.750
 to get and the little pestle the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.750
 small sleeve 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 so I use a pruner that I 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.959
 only used for cooking 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 so I'm going to take this part in 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:51.680
 fact that contains two bones and I'm going 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:03:00.660
 give a quick tap on it and I tell you 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:02.069
 and I will do the same from the side you 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.660
 can do this operation with the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.630
 knife simply there is no 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.040
 need to have a pruner simply 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.670
 I 'm going to where I got used 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.900
 to do with 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.269
 so now what am I going to do 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.510
 it's just going down the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:21.550
 chair gently along the two 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.200
 waters like this 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.710
 using my little pruner I'm going 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 remove the finest of both waters as 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:37.870
 this and I find myself with a little 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.400
 penguin simply that I 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.400
 will be able to use for our recipe 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.570
 we will protect the waters of our children 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.730
 penguins with a small paper 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.860
 of aluminum to avoid blackening them 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.560
 in cooking because of the marinade and 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 then you will dive no man show 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.440
 in the marinade 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.720
 we beat ten young rats properly 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.350
 I set fire to preheat to 200 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:08.170
 degrees and we see nora children 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:11.740
 start right now because that 's 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:16.450
 protect small islands that itches 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.019
 presence actually we put them a little 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.670
 the pilot simply 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.370
 so we have to make sure that 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.380
 areas 30 loaves in the marinade this is at 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.900
 to say that the bald sleeves is good 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.350
 actually standing in the place so for 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.600
 support them contract abounds 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.140
 now I'm going to cover them with 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.419
 marinade 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.250
 individually it is necessary 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.350
 coat on all the parts on 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.800

 I will give it ten minutes in the oven I 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.260
 will repeat the operation I 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.600
 put back in the oven for ten minutes 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.669
 I will repeat the operation and there I 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.060
 let it cook another 5 minutes 25 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.540

 fresh coriander for decoration but 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.280
 it's not even an obligation 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.910
 just to get them out of the fire to remove the 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.250
