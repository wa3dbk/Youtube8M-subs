over<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> our<00:01:28.619> picture<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:28.950> hand<00:01:29.250> will

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
over back to our picture at hand will

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.560 
over back to our picture at hand will
choose<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.540> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

so this is basically like a high
resolution<00:01:34.290> 1080p<00:01:35.100> picture<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> can

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
resolution 1080p picture and what it can

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600
