the face this you know we see something

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.090 
the face this you know we see something
like<00:01:27.030> Principal<00:01:27.659> Skinner<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> dog<00:01:28.770> or

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
like Principal Skinner as a dog or

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
like Principal Skinner as a dog or
something<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
something I think it's from the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
something I think it's from the
treehouse<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.990> horror<00:01:31.200> episode<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.979> not

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
sure who that is I think maybe it has

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.690 
sure who that is I think maybe it has
something<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.829> comic<00:01:38.220> book<00:01:38.369> guy<00:01:38.520> I'm
