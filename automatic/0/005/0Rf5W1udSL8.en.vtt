next<00:01:17.820> we've<00:01:18.000> got<00:01:18.030> our<00:01:18.710> user<00:01:19.710> manual<00:01:20.250> which

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
next we've got our user manual which

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.450 
next we've got our user manual which
feels<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:23.070> better<00:01:23.220> quality

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
than your average user manual but I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
than your average user manual but I
guess<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.759> should<00:01:26.939> expect<00:01:27.140> we've
