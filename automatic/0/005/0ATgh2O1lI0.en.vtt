together<00:01:19.640> maybe<00:01:20.640> another<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> same<00:01:21.299> side

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
together maybe another one the same side

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
together maybe another one the same side
to<00:01:21.780> match<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:22.770> fill<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> other

about<00:02:16.370> 14<00:02:17.370> inches<00:02:17.400> square<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.310> make<00:02:20.310> sure

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
about 14 inches square and make sure

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.860 
about 14 inches square and make sure
when<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.760> are<00:02:20.790> cutting<00:02:21.090> your<00:02:21.180> pipes<00:02:21.450> make

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
when you are cutting your pipes make

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.940 
when you are cutting your pipes make
sure<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> length<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.830> the

sure you know what the length of the
knuckles<00:02:23.370> are<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.330> don't<00:02:24.480> make<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.690> too

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
knuckles are so you don't make it too

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.300 
knuckles are so you don't make it too
big<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:25.320> low<00:02:25.410> measuring<00:02:25.680> 14<00:02:26.040> inches

make sure that some you incorporate the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.930 
make sure that some you incorporate the
size<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> knuckles<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.490> well<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.850> mean

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.020 
size the knuckles as well as I mean
there's<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.270> pipe<00:02:30.510> size<00:02:30.750> shorter<00:02:31.170> than<00:02:31.290> that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
there's the pipe size shorter than that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.060 
there's the pipe size shorter than that
okay<00:02:35.300> okay<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.450> build<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> main<00:02:37.350> base<00:02:37.680> part

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
okay okay I build the main base part

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.270 
okay okay I build the main base part
first<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.580> together<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.740> gonna<00:02:40.890> proceed

there as well just draw the whole three
I'll<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:57.930> say<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.500> second<00:02:59.239> and

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
I'll just say that one in a second and

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.060 
I'll just say that one in a second and
then<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.780> were<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.050> fit<00:03:01.260> into<00:03:01.380> those<00:03:01.620> two

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
then they were then fit into those two

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
who I'm seeing these bolts into the top

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.050 
who I'm seeing these bolts into the top
of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:10.010> surface<00:03:11.010> because<00:03:11.400> they're<00:03:11.580> too<00:03:11.790> deep

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.930 
of the surface because they're too deep
otherwise<00:03:12.630> they'll<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:13.250> stopping<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.459> laptop

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
otherwise they'll be stopping the laptop

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.510 

all<00:03:56.910> attached<00:03:57.360> now<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> did<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> base<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
all attached now I did do the base and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.690 
all attached now I did do the base and
some<00:03:59.670> weights<00:03:59.850> keep<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.780> place<00:04:00.960> in<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.230> car

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
some weights keep it in place in the car

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.340 
some weights keep it in place in the car
and<00:04:02.700> give<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.850> a<00:04:02.940> try<00:04:06.140> okay

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
and give it a try okay

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.860 
and give it a try okay
perhaps<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.710> was<00:04:07.770> in<00:04:07.890> place<00:04:08.660> brackets<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.720> keep

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
perhaps I was in place brackets to keep

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.660 
perhaps I was in place brackets to keep
it<00:04:09.990> light<00:04:10.440> enough<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:11.240> then<00:04:12.240> afters<00:04:12.660> as<00:04:12.810> well

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
it light enough and then afters as well

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.620 
it light enough and then afters as well
because<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.730> rubber<00:04:14.910> feet<00:04:15.090> one<00:04:15.300> sufficient

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
because the rubber feet one sufficient

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.170 
because the rubber feet one sufficient
enough<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.810> keep<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:16.110> place

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
enough to keep it in place

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.740 
enough to keep it in place
supporting<00:04:18.180> bar<00:04:19.190> yep<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.400> works<00:04:20.489> okay<00:04:20.940> I'll

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
supporting bar yep that works okay I'll

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.370 
supporting bar yep that works okay I'll
give<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.019> test<00:04:22.170> run

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
give it a test run

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.500 
give it a test run
that's<00:04:22.680> actually<00:04:22.950> work<00:04:23.100> alright<00:04:23.510> doesn't

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
that's actually work alright doesn't

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:35.700 
that's actually work alright doesn't
fall<00:04:24.690> over<00:04:24.720> nothing
