00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.740
 when are we going to sanction that 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.910
 when is it not, but you do not have 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.529
 right you have no right besides the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.820
 fifa laniel political charge was 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.620
 prohibited and sanctioned right away 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.510
 religious message 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 all go by and the director for doom 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.560
 and close- ups but it's gilbert gilbert 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.970
 the first federation 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.529
 really done sanctioned because of that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.689
 it is the Brazilian federation sochaux 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.830
 it was in 2002 at the time abbey road the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.289
 here are t-shirts to the man Jesus 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 had begun to pray is less great name 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 in 2002 I believe in 2000 2002 and there 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.250
 really the fifa had sanctioned and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.150
 indeed there have been changes to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 within the confederation 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.500
 brazilian who banned who had 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 forbidden at the time to the players of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.160
 publicly manifest their faith you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.230
 believe that jesus would have liked the chambering 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 with the dribble over the head 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:52.320
 of the name defender and in the name he would have 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:54.660
 not but after there is chicharito real no 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 I have nothing to equalize and took yesterday on 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
 the pitch on the sideline took 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 coaches yesterday exactly then 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.440
 just a trick anyway I 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.750
 I would still like to have 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.909
 awareness that there is responsibility too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 of TV directors because the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.820
 TV director he may very well not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 not show people stop objects 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.360
 heavy you can not make you fat 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.159
 plans on prayers said yesterday 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.659
 closeups on cross pools 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.580
 when a guy get close- ups on 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.290
 prices does not agree they are 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.759
 responsible did not enter the pictures do not 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.600
 do not agree i do not agree 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.280
 because I opposed 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.930
 a long time especially when I commented 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 matches this tip ie that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.439
 there were rules that were 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 dictated by the organizers and who 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.630
 was basically all that's problematic 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 all banners any manifestation 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 all violence all did not show 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.570
 not our new lots to show what 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.950
 shows that possibly eva explains 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.530
 after you stop studying we stop 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.170
 show but I prefer to show and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.030
 after saying it say on the air the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.380
 comment me I would have said yesterday I would have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.030
 said if you're smart I would have laundry 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 it is lamentable but I have hidden the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.719
 reality if you see I'm not sure 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.049
 now on neymar it's not a 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.119
 picture 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.409
 neymar is yes after the league match 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.810
 field is good but it's 100% 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.010
 passing this game there you see what the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.930
 maxi coat 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.880
 just but gilbert I understand your 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.680
 position is if I hear it on this 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.280
 area there after if we make it a 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.690
 system 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.460
 well you go back into the thing that makes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.480
 that I remember when I 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.920
 commented on the cup of the league there 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.690
 had league people in the bus 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.580
 governed and when the supporters of laurent 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.510
 will they wanted to invade the field 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.070
 because their team had no 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.630
 results he says we do not show the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.950
 guys are putting themselves on the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 grids and all and things and it's pope 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.150
 and this one gilbert montreal i'm going 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.730
 tell you there is a slight bend 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.020
 which poses problem bhv shots this is the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.400
 problem in your way of seeing the 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.540
 things is that what you're doing 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.410
 to say that's what a lot of chains 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.370
 have been doing for a very long time and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.810
 a lot of reporters did it's 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.550
 to say that they preferred not to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 convey a certain reality that is 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.190
 produced on the grounds and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.230
 finally they have hidden something that 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.940
 already existed several decades ago 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.200
 and who finally still exists 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.330
 today and today everyone 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.530
 surprised by saying you saw you saw 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.520
 people make the sign of the cross by 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.630
 example when he returned to the field 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.620
 but you saw him less because he had 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.300
 not as big shot and we 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.990
 back what you said except that the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.550
 problem is that today a lot 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.110
 people say ah, but it's funny 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.000
 religion is really present 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.040
 in football religion she is 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.470
 the essence of football football 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.940
 was born and there was born by institutions 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.530
 religious the first ball games 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.980
 3000 years ago they were rites 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.660
 religious 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.430
 religion is the very foundation of 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.620
 of football so after the book of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.850
 vilas you yeah that must also you 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.640
 better read I mean he 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.550
 is really bullshit you see I 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.190
 am fresh so that said it's fine 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.970
 what reality is about we 've got it 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.989
 but do not have it hidden and here they are 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.769
 run a name the project uses 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.769
 sometimes in any case I condemn it
