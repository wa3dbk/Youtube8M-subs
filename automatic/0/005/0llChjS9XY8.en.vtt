I'm<00:00:52.690> balancing<00:00:53.260> out<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:59.070> thickness<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.220> the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
I'm balancing out the thickness of the

I'm balancing out the thickness of the
ribbon<00:01:00.670> in<00:01:00.970> this<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.980> as<00:01:03.280> well<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:05.500> I

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
ribbon in this way as well and when I

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.609 
ribbon in this way as well and when I
lift<00:01:05.830> my<00:01:05.920> pen<00:01:06.040> I<00:01:06.250> always<00:01:06.700> lift<00:01:06.940> into<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:08.440> net

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
lift my pen I always lift into the net

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
where the negative space is being filled

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.170 
where the negative space is being filled
up<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.820> way<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.690> lot<00:01:16.930> like<00:01:17.140> painting

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
up so in a way it is a lot like painting

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
up so in a way it is a lot like painting
alright<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:19.570> we're<00:01:19.780> just<00:01:20.020> trying<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.350> outline

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:39.840 

go<00:01:24.040> as<00:01:24.250> slow<00:01:24.640> as<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.940> want<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.460> don't<00:01:39.700> be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
go as slow as you want and don't be

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:49.320 
go as slow as you want and don't be
afraid<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.270> draw<00:01:40.600> over<00:01:41.050> here<00:01:41.290> cross<00:01:42.280> hatching

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.180 

let's<00:01:50.050> just<00:01:50.230> start<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.890> fill<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.670> space

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
let's just start to fill in the space

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.670 
let's just start to fill in the space
around<00:01:54.190> your<00:01:54.550> lines<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:55.210> little<00:01:55.660> quicker<00:01:56.290> and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
around your lines a little quicker and

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.470 
around your lines a little quicker and
faster<00:01:59.280> that<00:02:00.280> way<00:02:00.310> when<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.700> take<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> really

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
faster that way when we take a really

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.990 
faster that way when we take a really
thick<00:02:01.720> marker<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:03.220> really<00:02:03.460> fill<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.820> that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
thick marker to really fill in that

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.710 
thick marker to really fill in that
space<00:02:05.970> you're<00:02:06.970> not<00:02:07.120> going<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.570> danger

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
space you're not going to be in danger

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:18.660 
space you're not going to be in danger
of<00:02:07.930> going<00:02:08.530> over<00:02:08.890> your<00:02:09.540> positive<00:02:10.540> space<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.520> if

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
of going over your positive space and if

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.950 
of going over your positive space and if
you<00:02:18.790> leave<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> little<00:02:19.180> bit<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.390> pencil<00:02:19.780> here

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
you leave a little bit of pencil here

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.520 
you leave a little bit of pencil here
and<00:02:20.080> there<00:02:20.260> don't<00:02:21.160> fret<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.900> know<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.140> if

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and there don't fret but know that if

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.190 
and there don't fret but know that if
you<00:02:23.680> erase<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:25.300> thicker<00:02:25.540> lines<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.080> you've

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
you erase the thicker lines that you've

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.190 
you erase the thicker lines that you've
been<00:02:26.320> working<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.160> going<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.900> take<00:02:28.900> away

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
just to fill in this space go real slow

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:12.809 
just to fill in this space go real slow
when<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.340> get<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> thinner<00:03:58.090> spot
