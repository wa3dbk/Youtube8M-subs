00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
around in terms of the type of volume

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
around in terms of the type of volume
that<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> feel<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.030> let's<00:00:42.270> take<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that you want to feel so let's take a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.350 
that you want to feel so let's take a
look<00:00:42.780> what's<00:00:42.989> underneath<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.710> cap<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.360> see

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
look what's underneath the cap and see

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
look what's underneath the cap and see
how<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.690> mascara<00:00:46.079> works<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.760> first<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.300> all

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
how this mascara works a so first of all

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.529 
how this mascara works a so first of all
I've<00:00:48.629> dialed<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> mascara<00:00:49.829> volume<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I've dialed the mascara volume down to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
I've dialed the mascara volume down to
one<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.199> aligned<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.190> number<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.760> with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
one so I've aligned the number one with

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
one so I've aligned the number one with
the<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.780> square<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> indicates<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the little square that indicates the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.840 
the little square that indicates the
volume<00:00:56.640> shift<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.430> half

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
volume shift and as you can see the half

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
volume shift and as you can see the half
of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> tube<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> actually<00:01:01.079> round<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of the tube is actually round up so this

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.369 
of the tube is actually round up so this
actually<00:01:02.399> controls<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.270> much<00:01:03.300> volume<00:01:03.719> how

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
actually controls how much volume how

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.910 
actually controls how much volume how
much<00:01:04.559> mascara<00:01:04.979> gets<00:01:05.280> deposited<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.240> brush

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
much mascara gets deposited on the brush

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
much mascara gets deposited on the brush
taking<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> brush<00:01:08.970> after<00:01:09.450> dialing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
taking a look at the brush after dialing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.679 
taking a look at the brush after dialing
21<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.549> much<00:01:11.700> mascara<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.540> on

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
21 we don't have so much mascara put on

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
21 we don't have so much mascara put on
there<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.409> intensity<00:01:14.340> will<00:01:14.640> give

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
there and so this intensity will give

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.289 
there and so this intensity will give
you<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.270> slight<00:01:15.990> elongation<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.299> minimal

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you just slight elongation and minimal

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
you just slight elongation and minimal
volume<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:19.380> let's<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> look<00:01:19.890> what

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
volume now let's have a look what

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
volume now let's have a look what
happens<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.060> dial<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.409> as

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
happens when we dial it up to two so as

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
happens when we dial it up to two so as
we<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.189> I've<00:01:23.610> dialed<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.330> two

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
we can see here I've dialed it up to two

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
we can see here I've dialed it up to two
and<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.380> half<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> tube<00:01:26.340> has<00:01:26.520> actually

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and the half of the tube has actually

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
and the half of the tube has actually
gone<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.310> what

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

will give you the maximum volume so what

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
will give you the maximum volume so what
you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.439> achieve<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.340> expect<00:01:53.670> to
