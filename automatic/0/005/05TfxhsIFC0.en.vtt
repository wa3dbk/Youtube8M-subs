00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.379
 good evening donadoni so much juventus maybe 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.610
 too little Juventus I ask you little 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.840
 little especially in what today 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.150
 today we have been little in everything 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.270
 especially in the desire in the determination 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 determination in wanting to fight back 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
 blow by blow also from the point of view 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.019
 physical we have lost all 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.439
 duels 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.699
 we have been very giving up a lot 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.740
 hesitant this made out a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 result as heavy as today 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.579
 plus with really nice goals 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.380
 granted with extreme ease 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.370
 precisely because we were mentally 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.450
 blocked and too much disheartened 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.059
 probably facing an opponent 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 strong as tenderness and distrust are 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.579
 children of this ranking or there is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.680
 of the other but we came from a result 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.930
 important and positive with the inter of two 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 at zero at home he also played well with 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.629
 a different determination today though 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.190
 really very stuck very afraid 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.050
 and this is the thing that makes me more angry 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.670
 because there is that you can take goals 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.800
 there cannot be that you grant them with 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.050
 this facility clearly you have of 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.560
 faced with high-quality opponents 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.270
 and if you are so renouncing and if it is 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.670
 so hesitant and clear that 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.230
 take advantage of this study 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.970
 roberto's consideration of how to do it a 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.370
 spend seven days on the team 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.620
 bad that you saw against the inter ha 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.490
 a team as compliant as it is 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.490
 seen today at the stadium 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.500
 we are living proof that football 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.350
 it also reserves these changes 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.990
 so fast I can honestly struggle 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.820
 to explain it to me because I believe that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.560
 Inter match was a lot 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.110
 significant from this point of view e 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.270
 today have all this tension this 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.560
 fear this concern of 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.700
 face an opponent not me 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.100
 I expected it and so we really do 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.920
 still thinking about rolling up our 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 sleeves know that if the matches don't 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.970
 they can come up with results 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.080
 with important important plays 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.760
 you have to do it through the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.649
 determination and grit what today 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.000
 there was absolutely no thanks thanks to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.360
 roberto donadoni thanks to francesco 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.360
