just<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.940> few<00:02:21.150> years<00:02:21.300> ago<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.780> why<00:02:22.170> all<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
just a few years ago but why all the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380 
just a few years ago but why all the
success<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.400> women's<00:02:23.670> side<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.000> rarely

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
success on the women's side you rarely

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.540 
success on the women's side you rarely
hear<00:02:24.569> about<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> male<00:02:25.170> tennis<00:02:26.099> player<00:02:26.310> coming

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
hear about a male tennis player coming

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.240 
hear about a male tennis player coming
from<00:02:26.760> China<00:02:27.060> yeah<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:28.080> think<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:28.799> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
from China yeah I think because the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610 
from China yeah I think because the
training<00:02:29.640> program<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.150> China<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.630> based<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.140> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
training program in China is based on a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.400 
training program in China is based on a
lot<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.280> running<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.030> know<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.180> lot<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> eating

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
lot of running you know a lot of eating

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.860 
lot of running you know a lot of eating
balls<00:02:34.620> hitting<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.160> balls<00:02:35.340> hard<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.510> lot

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
balls hitting the balls hard and a lot

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.500 
balls hitting the balls hard and a lot
of<00:02:37.019> repetition<00:02:37.290> or<00:02:37.830> hard<00:02:38.130> work<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
of repetition or hard work so in the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.180 
of repetition or hard work so in the
men's<00:02:39.750> game<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.620> doesn't<00:02:41.040> work

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
men's game it just it just doesn't work

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.430 
men's game it just it just doesn't work
you<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.730> mean<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.170> more

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
you know I mean you have to be more

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.940 
you know I mean you have to be more
creative<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> be<00:02:45.660> more<00:02:45.950> individual

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
creative you have to be more individual

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.539 
creative you have to be more individual
so<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.819> think<00:02:48.299> they<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> adjust<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
so I think they have to adjust to do to

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.820 
so I think they have to adjust to do to
the<00:02:50.670> training<00:02:51.030> program<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.540> China<00:02:51.810> yeah<00:02:52.319> she's
