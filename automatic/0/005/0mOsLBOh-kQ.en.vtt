no charge it comes with the application
I<00:04:33.080> think<00:04:33.110> that's<00:04:33.500> very<00:04:33.590> very<00:04:34.010> cool<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.990> the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I think that's very very cool so the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.810 
I think that's very very cool so the
very<00:04:36.349> bare<00:04:36.680> minimum<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:37.280> want<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.639> have<00:04:37.789> a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
very bare minimum you want to have a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.629 
very bare minimum you want to have a
lesser<00:04:38.449> a<00:04:38.780> list<00:04:39.260> server<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.830> mailing<00:04:40.370> list

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
lesser a list server a mailing list

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.629 
lesser a list server a mailing list
server<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.240> take<00:04:41.449> care<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:42.050> for<00:04:42.320> you

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
server to take care of that for you

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.409 
server to take care of that for you
because<00:04:43.639> then<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.669> automates<00:04:46.669> a<00:04:46.969> lot<00:04:47.240> of

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
because then it it automates a lot of

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.010 
because then it it automates a lot of
this

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
this

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.170 
this
for<00:04:48.379> you<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.800> helps<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.430> stay<00:04:49.490> in<00:04:49.940> compliance

for you and helps you stay in compliance
so<00:04:50.889> I<00:04:51.889> think<00:04:52.400> it's<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.500> really<00:04:54.500> really<00:04:54.889> good

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
so I think it's a really really good

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.070 
so I think it's a really really good
investment<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:56.030> have<00:04:56.180> something<00:04:56.659> like<00:04:56.840> that

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
investment to have something like that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.300 
investment to have something like that
so<00:04:57.819> we<00:04:58.819> had<00:04:59.449> we<00:05:00.139> had<00:05:00.319> very<00:05:00.590> very<00:05:00.650> good<00:05:00.919> success

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
so we had we had very very good success

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.529 
so we had we had very very good success
