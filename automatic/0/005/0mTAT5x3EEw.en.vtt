00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
little a little more clearly but it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.690 
little a little more clearly but it's
funny<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> watch<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.920> when<00:01:23.220> something

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
funny to watch that when something

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.590 
funny to watch that when something
victory<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.630> defeat<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.409> very<00:01:26.400> clearly<00:01:27.119> about

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
victory or defeat is very clearly about

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.780

to<00:01:27.659> happen<00:01:28.020> people<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.400> overdrive

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to happen people just go into overdrive

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
capture all the ridiculous things that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.550 
capture all the ridiculous things that
happen<00:01:49.439> during<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.520> final<00:01:51.270> 60<00:01:51.689> seconds<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
happen during the final 60 seconds of a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
happen during the final 60 seconds of a
pretty<00:01:52.829> much<00:01:53.009> every<00:01:53.399> tf2<00:01:53.909> game<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.329> play

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
pretty much every tf2 game you play

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
pretty much every tf2 game you play
we've<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.409> seen<00:01:55.710> crazy<00:01:56.070> shit<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> last<00:01:56.939> 30

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
we've all seen crazy shit in the last 30

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
we've all seen crazy shit in the last 30
seconds<00:01:57.659> 60<00:01:58.020> seconds<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> game<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.250> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
seconds 60 seconds of a game so it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.950 
seconds 60 seconds of a game so it
probably<00:01:59.640> wouldn't<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.149> hard<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
probably wouldn't be that hard to get it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
probably wouldn't be that hard to get it
but<00:02:01.320> we're<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> transition<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.340> now

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
but we're going to transition here now

are on the final point now and the Kart
is<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.920> sitting<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.420> it's<00:02:12.420> hanging<00:02:12.720> out

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
is kind of sitting here it's hanging out

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700 
is kind of sitting here it's hanging out
right<00:02:13.170> near<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
right near the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
right near the
every<00:02:13.920> last<00:02:14.190> point<00:02:14.670> sitting<00:02:14.970> right<00:02:15.240> there

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
every last point sitting right there

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
every last point sitting right there
they<00:02:15.630> got<00:02:15.780> plenty<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.260> time<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.460> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
they got plenty of time to do this and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
they got plenty of time to do this and
they've<00:02:18.690> been<00:02:18.840> steamrolling<00:02:19.320> us<00:02:19.500> almost<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
they've been steamrolling us almost the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
they've been steamrolling us almost the
whole<00:02:19.980> game<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.400> cut<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:20.820> most<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.780> is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
whole game I cut out most of it is

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.390 
whole game I cut out most of it is
obviously<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.530> would<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.860> pretty<00:02:23.130> boring

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
obviously that would be a pretty boring

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.040 
obviously that would be a pretty boring
video<00:02:23.760> hey<00:02:24.000> let's<00:02:24.210> watch<00:02:24.450> Jeremy<00:02:24.900> get

steamrolled no no who wants to watch
that<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.510> probably<00:02:27.720> some<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.110> would

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that is probably some of you that would

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
that is probably some of you that would
want<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> watch<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> took<00:02:29.580> most<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.880> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
want to watch that but I took most of it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760 
want to watch that but I took most of it
out<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.330> put<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> first<00:02:30.990> clip<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.380> there<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.740> a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
out I put the first clip in there for a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.620 
out I put the first clip in there for a
little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.220> preface<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> see

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
little bit of preface to it but you see

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.510 
little bit of preface to it but you see
wherever<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.080> they<00:02:34.290> got<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> lot<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> time<00:02:34.950> we

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
wherever it they got a lot of time we

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.160 
wherever it they got a lot of time we
know<00:02:35.730> they<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> lot<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.390> time<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.840> we

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
know they have a lot of time and we

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.690 
know they have a lot of time and we
don't<00:02:37.320> want<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> lose<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.400> go<00:02:38.550> into

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
don't want to lose so we go into

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.730 
don't want to lose so we go into
freakout<00:02:39.150> mode<00:02:39.390> first<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.990> red<00:02:40.200> team<00:02:40.440> always

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
freakout mode first the red team always

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.700 
freakout mode first the red team always
goes<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.430> freakout<00:02:41.880> mode<00:02:42.180> first<00:02:42.720> because

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
goes into freakout mode first because

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.320 
goes into freakout mode first because
they<00:02:44.040> don't<00:02:44.340> want<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.610> lose<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.090> if

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
they don't want to lose in it's if

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.180 
they don't want to lose in it's if
they're<00:02:45.510> close<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.960> losing<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.860> don't<00:02:47.040> want

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
they're close to losing they don't want

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.430 
they're close to losing they don't want
it<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.340> happen<00:02:47.520> blue<00:02:48.330> doesn't<00:02:48.690> typically<00:02:49.170> go

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
it to happen blue doesn't typically go

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.160 
it to happen blue doesn't typically go
into<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> insanity<00:02:50.670> freakout<00:02:51.060> mode<00:02:51.300> until

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
into the insanity freakout mode until

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
into the insanity freakout mode until
there's<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.740> less<00:02:52.950> than<00:02:53.220> two<00:02:53.430> minutes

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
there's like less than two minutes

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.390 
there's like less than two minutes
because<00:02:54.180> then<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.900> they<00:02:55.380> can't<00:02:55.710> push<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.220> last

usually<00:04:52.770> typically<00:04:53.070> cut<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.490> respawn<00:04:54.030> time

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
usually typically cut the respawn time

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.340 
usually typically cut the respawn time
because<00:04:54.510> it's<00:04:54.660> just<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:54.870> just<00:04:55.050> sitting<00:04:55.230> there

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
because it's just you just sitting there

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.990 
because it's just you just sitting there
you're<00:04:55.470> looking<00:04:55.680> at<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> respawn<00:04:56.190> timer<00:04:56.520> but

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
you're looking at a respawn timer but

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.640 
you're looking at a respawn timer but
for<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:57.480> if<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.020> camera<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.380> sitting

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
for this one if the camera is sitting

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.990 
for this one if the camera is sitting
right<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:59.010> there<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.520> get<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.760> check

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
right on there and you can get to check

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000 
right on there and you can get to check
out<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.360> craziness<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.410> craziness

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
out the craziness and the craziness

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.470 
out the craziness and the craziness
because<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.340> has<00:05:02.430> kind<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.700> already<00:05:02.880> started

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
because it has kind of already started

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.600 
because it has kind of already started
I'm<00:05:03.600> sure<00:05:03.750> you've<00:05:03.930> seen<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.920> engineer<00:05:05.460> on

I'm sure you've seen the engineer on

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.700 
I'm sure you've seen the engineer on
blue<00:05:05.970> that's<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.480> building<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.110> bubble<00:05:07.440> three

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710
