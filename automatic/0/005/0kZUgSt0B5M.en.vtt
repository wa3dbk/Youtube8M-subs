00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello apple iphone friends because this time I come a video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.660
 how-to tutorial 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.359
 as they mentioned several repositories per hundred 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.289
 in the crossings not in laziness 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.560
 because of the theme that there is sometime when we do the restoration we do not know 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.039
 where no 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.669
 we do not have a list or if we have a list we have to enter all the 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.899
 repositories 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.899
 one by one and shannon things 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.999
 For example, look at this snapshot of this video 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.220
 when you do he 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.230
 min the restoration 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.370
 a house bus 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.770
 and I just left you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.000
 By default those that do install do not 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.980
 six I think they are 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.840
 percent and for the top part base today for the bottom part or equal 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.860
 empty not 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.480
 Well, the executorial cob can be well up 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.890
 at least even more 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.200
 50 in front of d the repository but from 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 bad we can add several repositories 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.260
 by the way how we do it 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.080
 for example, we are going to 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.630
 this file that I'm going to upload 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.810
 which is called south serve 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560
 then this file 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.610
 you when you download to your s 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.800
 per cent do not open them or no no I will not want to open the why not recognize it 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.250
 format you do not have to right click 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.230
 open and co 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.100
 select the flush pad of windows obed corner 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.950
 the globe that in others 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 in your case 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.670
 this is because this file is also totally avoidable 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.740
 Create your own list of events 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.399
 in which guillermo me to avoid always maintaining the value of 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.510
 the file 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.730
 for example we can find several repositories 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.960
 percent 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.490
 I do not know you can create your own boyfriend list for example from this I think that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.939
 there are some 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.299
 58 60 opponents 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.819
 it's a list 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.379
 I hate between mind is ready 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.260
 Hello, I have a hard time. I have another much shorter list, but if someone 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
 interested by number of original posts 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.350
 well this would be the way not now explained how 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.639
 this is to avoid costs and they do not come 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.909
 if they do not want a file 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.059
 for example they can eliminate us delete this will allow value of 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.499
 of the asterisk he min 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.449
 washed the point baghdad 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.939
 all the same way as estadi 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.830
 then this one your service I'll upload it gave to both worlds 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.529
 To download it 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.949
 well then what we will need will be the 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.729
 a program to be able to access via scha 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.729
 the expo 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.929
 in my case 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.130
 I use 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.679
 alak shoulders 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.819
 or some that will use any other type of programs 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.799
 but the same way to upload etc 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.529
 so 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.010
 national uru cc oo 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.249
 Yes now 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.249
 outside 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.909
 min put the sun out the first thing we have to do is 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.309
 the route to get the socialist and lift 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.999
 private 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.329
 I accepted 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.619
 south to be smart 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.559
 we give you a folder like summer 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.449
 is here 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.909
 I, for example, have already loaded it for you to see 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.430
 How soccer liz is charged by telling you you know nothing about him 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.809
 in a south folder it says 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:55.979
 or the file 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.209
 I drag it loose and it automatically loads 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:01.979
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 Once this is done, what they have to do is 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.239
 the start the voice system be to see 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.709
 turn off the iphone 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.239
 ii 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.379
 then they appear in the expo 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.229
 line flight turn on tickets and diamonds and candy 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.370
 and they will see that nothing has been charged but it does add the victorious document of 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.450
 the bid I talked about measuring 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.870
 they are filling the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.719
 this one of all things 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.979
 automatically going to hook all 13 10 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.840
 Iceberg in Aramaic 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.889
 in another fact in other cases that which does not want 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.160
 do not want to add more tours for a hundred if it starts to load 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.029
 there is another method 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:52.179
 messi we connect to the iphone via ssh the first thing we have to do is the 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.460
 aductor private 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.460
 auger 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.870
 to pt 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.309
 if we give you a portfolio ready 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:12.089
 will open the list of some passages and things do not appear to me 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.089
 pile because today I called at 60 to prove it 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.169
 when you have done the administration this prayer from the iphone 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.180
 once appears to a few 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.849
 so 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.909
 these and if they want it but they can delete these folders 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.139
 deleted from 2000 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.599
 whatever they want they leave it totally empty or slip 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.019
 but keep in mind that the folder started when you do not have to touch 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.529
 once they have removed all of it 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.339
 what they have to do is ap hararé gives to pay he 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.960
 to rubble to be closed of pomar watched the program with which they accede 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.759
 via ssh 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.069
 then 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.339
 they have to 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.270
 that one mabel device the iphone can turn on 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.930
 if you are automatically city more ideas there will be nothing will not smell return 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.139
 to charge the same thing is a problem of some 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.400
 they have when they are appears the clouds were decided they can not do this step of 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.800
 finish reading 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.150
 erase everything 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.700
 and then again put back again notorious I recommend a vein of a 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.869
 ipcva auto mode 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.020
 I say of the district then 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.449
 turn off the iphone 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.479
 re-ignite they do not enter like this anywhere 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.759
 hacienda started of the computer June of the pcm 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.789
 like from the computer 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.259
 then in it the previous step did not 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.899
 the primate ep south mat glided 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:52.139
 and that's where they have to put their deposit list rivers montt 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.969
 so that for the students so that some do it in a different way 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.830
 then 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.360
 once your steps have been made 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.439
 they give me here 

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.659
 how are they loaded 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.270
 the entire list of 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.620
 the ap of repositorios us above and I for example put 1 for it it 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.240
 they saw 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.490
 pérez is added manual but if you see here 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.759
 he has added a lot of 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.300
 the repository is 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.889
 and live pull the installation of all the repositories may take so 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.879
 minus about four minutes 

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.159
 but taking into account 

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.159
 that you are not going to want the 60 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.550
 they're going to avoid going to create their own list of sulser 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.929
 for possible of this prayer it is therefore it will be left less thought even in 

00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:46.569
 Syria advances a little more 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:48.679
 faster 

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:51.679
 and that will have 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:53.889
 everything you want 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:56.590
 well that's all we see in the comments
