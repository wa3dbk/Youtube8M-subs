00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
this is the piece that I cut off and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
this is the piece that I cut off and
almost<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.960> focusing<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:28.310> cut<00:01:29.310> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
almost it's like focusing so I cut this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
almost it's like focusing so I cut this
off<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.260> end<00:01:31.470> supposed

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
off this and this is this end supposed

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.470 
off this and this is this end supposed
to<00:01:31.800> be<00:01:31.890> closest<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.460> eye<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.240> lot<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
to be closest to the eye I know a lot of

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.360 
to be closest to the eye I know a lot of
people<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> cut<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> off<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.800> end<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
people like to cut it off this end but I

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.790 
people like to cut it off this end but I
find<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.780> doesn't<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.260> work<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.650> my

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
find that it doesn't really work with my

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.060 
find that it doesn't really work with my
eyes<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:39.320> when<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> cut<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.800> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
eyes because when you cut it off this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
eyes because when you cut it off this
and<00:01:41.310> say<00:01:41.550> if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.760> cut<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.510> off

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and say if you cut like this much off

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.260 
and say if you cut like this much off
this<00:01:43.260> piece<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.830> be<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.220> longer<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.760> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
this piece will be a lot longer and the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
this piece will be a lot longer and the
natural<00:01:45.750> curvature<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.740> eye

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
natural curvature of your eye

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.000 
natural curvature of your eye
it<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.120> get<00:01:48.299> shorter<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:49.200> eyelashes<00:01:49.770> do

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
it does get shorter your eyelashes do

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.550 
it does get shorter your eyelashes do
get<00:01:50.220> shorter<00:01:50.580> like<00:01:50.909> closer<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:52.350> they

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
get shorter like closer to here they

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.070 
get shorter like closer to here they
don't<00:01:52.680> stay<00:01:53.070> long<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.370> if<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.390> cut<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> off<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
don't stay long so if I cut it off the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.160 
don't stay long so if I cut it off the
longer<00:01:55.470> side<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.479> eyelashes<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:58.049> be

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
longer side then the eyelashes would be

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.370 
longer side then the eyelashes would be
really<00:01:58.470> long<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:58.830> look<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.250> really<00:02:00.260> like<00:02:01.260> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
really long and look like really like a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.080 
really long and look like really like a
like<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> wing<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.250> don't<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
like a wing and I don't really want that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
like a wing and I don't really want that
so<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> instead<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> cutting<00:02:04.470> off<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.860> side<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
so I instead of cutting off this side I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.969 
so I instead of cutting off this side I
cut<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.460> near<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:06.240> eye<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.380> find<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.799> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
cut off near my eye and I find it it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.190 
cut off near my eye and I find it it
still<00:02:08.670> goes<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.929> gives<00:02:10.049> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
still goes in like this and it gives it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.589 
still goes in like this and it gives it
like<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.769> nice<00:02:10.950> look<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> do<00:02:12.330> mine<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
like a really nice look so I do mine a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.390 
like a really nice look so I do mine a
little<00:02:12.810> bit<00:02:12.959> differently<00:02:13.290> than<00:02:13.470> most<00:02:14.069> people

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
little bit differently than most people

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.699 
little bit differently than most people
so<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> did<00:02:15.480> cut<00:02:15.720> off<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.140> tiny<00:02:16.409> bit<00:02:16.650> because

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
so I did cut off just a tiny bit because

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.670 
so I did cut off just a tiny bit because
you<00:02:17.189> need<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.640> measure<00:02:17.849> her<00:02:18.090> eye<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.530> do

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
you need to measure her eye and to do

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.740 
you need to measure her eye and to do
that<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:20.939> to<00:02:21.060> put<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.599> eye

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
that I'm just got to put it on your eye

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.410 
that I'm just got to put it on your eye
like<00:02:21.930> this

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.729 

and<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.079> see<00:02:27.239> wherever<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.689> think<00:02:28.989> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
and then just see wherever you think the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.119 
and then just see wherever you think the
eyelashes<00:02:30.189> look<00:02:30.340> best<00:02:30.609> like<00:02:30.909> so<00:02:31.659> I<00:02:32.109> don't<00:02:32.920> like

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
eyelashes look best like so I don't like

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.360 
eyelashes look best like so I don't like
my<00:02:33.370> other<00:02:33.549> she's<00:02:33.790> coming<00:02:34.799> right<00:02:35.799> at<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.219> end

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
my other she's coming right at the end

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.879 
my other she's coming right at the end
of<00:02:36.489> my<00:02:36.609> eyelashes<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.079> fake<00:02:38.349> eyelashes

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
of my eyelashes like the fake eyelashes

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.009 
of my eyelashes like the fake eyelashes
because<00:02:39.219> I<00:02:39.249> think<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.700> looks<00:02:39.879> too<00:02:40.180> much<00:02:40.209> it

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
because I think it looks too much it

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.509 
because I think it looks too much it
looks<00:02:41.170> weird<00:02:41.439> so<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.010> move<00:02:42.250> mine<00:02:42.489> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
looks weird so I like to move mine a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.729 
looks weird so I like to move mine a
little<00:02:42.790> bit<00:02:43.000> closer<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.719> inside<00:02:44.109> so<00:02:44.349> it

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
little bit closer to the inside so it

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.679 
little bit closer to the inside so it
looks<00:02:45.219> more<00:02:45.969> natural<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.879> then<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.389> cut<00:02:49.599> off

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
looks more natural so then you cut off

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.539 
looks more natural so then you cut off
as<00:02:49.870> much<00:02:50.079> as<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.319> need<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.919> cut<00:02:51.189> off<00:02:51.219> and<00:02:51.489> I

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
as much as you need to cut off and I

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.399 
as much as you need to cut off and I
like<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.909> cut<00:02:52.060> mine<00:02:52.209> off<00:02:52.239> on<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.599> inside<00:02:52.959> so

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
like to cut mine off on the inside so

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.789 
like to cut mine off on the inside so
then<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.769> take<00:02:54.189> eyelash<00:02:54.609> glue<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:56.469> is<00:02:56.590> the

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
then I take eyelash glue and this is the

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.110 
then I take eyelash glue and this is the
duo<00:02:57.040> eyelash<00:02:57.879> glue<00:02:58.359> I<00:02:58.989> bought<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.620> at<00:02:59.799> Mac

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
duo eyelash glue I bought this at Mac

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.220 
duo eyelash glue I bought this at Mac
the<00:03:01.120> only<00:03:01.269> reason<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.540> bought<00:03:01.719> this<00:03:01.810> at<00:03:01.959> Mac<00:03:02.079> was

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
the only reason I bought this at Mac was

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.589 
the only reason I bought this at Mac was
a<00:03:02.260> long<00:03:02.500> story<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:02.919> I<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.819> video<00:03:04.329> on<00:03:04.389> that

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
a long story and I have a video on that

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.709 
a long story and I have a video on that
but<00:03:05.469> I<00:03:05.949> don't<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.269> eyelash<00:03:07.599> glue

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
but I don't like the the eyelash glue

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.990 
but I don't like the the eyelash glue
eyelash<00:03:08.590> glue<00:03:08.769> because<00:03:09.189> it<00:03:09.219> doesn't<00:03:09.879> have

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
eyelash glue because it doesn't have

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.729 
eyelash glue because it doesn't have
latex<00:03:10.389> in<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.599> I<00:03:10.719> like<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.079> one<00:03:11.230> with<00:03:11.409> latex<00:03:11.909> so

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
latex in it I like the one with latex so

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.259 
latex in it I like the one with latex so
that's<00:03:14.739> why<00:03:14.919> I<00:03:14.949> use<00:03:15.159> this<00:03:15.250> one<00:03:15.430> okay<00:03:15.909> so<00:03:15.939> what

it also on the top of it right here

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.259 
it also on the top of it right here
because<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:51.489> gonna<00:03:51.610> sit<00:03:51.880> against<00:03:52.120> your

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
because that's gonna sit against your

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.930 
because that's gonna sit against your
skin<00:03:52.569> on<00:03:52.780> your<00:03:53.080> eyelashes<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.860> find<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.400> it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
skin on your eyelashes I find this it

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.670 
skin on your eyelashes I find this it
holds<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.450> best<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.319> want<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.560> make

holds it the best and you want to make

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.860 
holds it the best and you want to make
sure<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.370> glue<00:03:57.970> on<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.510> corners

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
sure that you get glue on the corners

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.160 
sure that you get glue on the corners
because<00:03:59.769> the<00:04:00.190> corners<00:04:00.569> tend<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.660> lift<00:04:01.840> but

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170

go from the root of my natural eyelashes
and<00:06:22.969> I<00:06:23.120> recommend<00:06:23.750> doing<00:06:23.930> this<00:06:24.199> after<00:06:24.620> your

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
and I recommend doing this after your

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.459 
and I recommend doing this after your
eyelashes<00:06:25.159> are<00:06:25.250> dry<00:06:25.849> because<00:06:26.479> I<00:06:26.780> mean<00:06:27.289> like

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
eyelashes are dry because I mean like

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.170 
eyelashes are dry because I mean like
that<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:27.919> glue<00:06:28.069> is<00:06:28.250> dry<00:06:28.460> cuz<00:06:28.699> you<00:06:28.789> don't<00:06:28.939> want

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
that the glue is dry cuz you don't want

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.490 
that the glue is dry cuz you don't want
your<00:06:29.330> eye<00:06:29.360> should<00:06:29.689> to<00:06:29.930> be<00:06:29.960> moving<00:06:30.379> around

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
your eye should to be moving around

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.379 
your eye should to be moving around
everywhere

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.020 

and<00:06:37.659> then<00:06:38.080> I<00:06:38.349> just<00:06:38.530> like<00:06:38.710> to<00:06:38.830> put<00:06:38.949> a<00:06:39.030> mascara

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
and then I just like to put a mascara

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.749 
and then I just like to put a mascara
because<00:06:40.210> I<00:06:40.419> only<00:06:40.689> did<00:06:41.319> the<00:06:41.530> top<00:06:41.770> liner<00:06:42.340> the

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 
because I only did the top liner the

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:50.040 
because I only did the top liner the
liquid<00:06:42.909> eyeliner<00:06:43.860> my<00:06:44.860> mascara<00:06:45.370> on<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.610> bottom

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.439 

and<00:06:50.560> if<00:06:50.680> you<00:06:50.770> don't<00:06:50.919> like<00:06:51.160> the<00:06:51.789> shiny<00:06:52.090> look<00:06:52.360> I

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:53.969 
and if you don't like the shiny look I
don't<00:06:52.509> know<00:06:52.660> if<00:06:52.750> you<00:06:52.810> can<00:06:52.930> notice<00:06:53.349> that<00:06:53.530> it's<00:06:53.860> a

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
don't know if you can notice that it's a

don't know if you can notice that it's a
little<00:06:54.099> bit<00:06:54.280> shiny<00:06:54.490> on<00:06:54.699> top<00:06:54.879> you<00:06:55.030> could<00:06:55.150> just

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
little bit shiny on top you could just

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.540 
little bit shiny on top you could just
go<00:06:55.449> over<00:06:55.539> with<00:06:55.810> some<00:06:57.120> black<00:06:58.120> eyeshadow<00:06:59.550> just

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
go over with some black eyeshadow just

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.980 
go over with some black eyeshadow just
