also and I found that it is quite
dramatically<00:01:19.090> different<00:01:19.360> from<00:01:19.630> using<00:01:20.110> a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
dramatically different from using a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.000 
dramatically different from using a
desktop<00:01:20.380> computer<00:01:20.850> well<00:01:21.850> duh<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.450> mean<00:01:23.010> you

quite<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> bit<00:01:42.760> knock<00:01:43.600> on<00:01:43.630> top<00:01:44.110> really<00:01:44.350> but

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
quite a bit knock on top really but

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.860 
quite a bit knock on top really but
under<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.550> if<00:01:45.700> you're<00:01:45.820> using<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.210> macbook<00:01:46.420> pro

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
under so if you're using a macbook pro

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.270 
under so if you're using a macbook pro
on<00:01:47.229> your<00:01:48.040> lap<00:01:48.220> be<00:01:48.940> careful<00:01:49.240> for<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.510> area<00:01:49.840> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
on your lap be careful for this area and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.500 
on your lap be careful for this area and

then again I don't need to tell you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.330 
then again I don't need to tell you

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
because you probably use laptops far

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.520 
because you probably use laptops far
longer<00:01:54.520> than<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.909> have<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.570> laptop<00:01:56.170> computer

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
I think it is worth it because like some

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.930 
I think it is worth it because like some
people<00:02:22.380> say<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.650> text<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.430> screen<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
people say the text on the screen is a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.540 
people say the text on the screen is a
bit<00:02:24.150> hard<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.690> see<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.040> already<00:02:26.400> have

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
bit hard to see but you already have

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.060 
bit hard to see but you already have
functions<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:28.050> zoom<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> webpage

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
charging at but the moments just about

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.220 
charging at but the moments just about
fully<00:03:29.090> charged<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.630> it's<00:03:29.750> not<00:03:29.900> really<00:03:29.960> going

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
fully charged so it's not really going

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.320 
fully charged so it's not really going
to<00:03:30.380> do<00:03:30.650> anything<00:03:30.860> that's<00:03:31.580> why<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:31.940> green

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
prolonged period of time this part of

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.410 
prolonged period of time this part of
the<00:05:03.200> left<00:05:03.440> of<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.070> laptop<00:05:04.670> is<00:05:04.910> going<00:05:05.120> to<00:05:05.180> cut

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
the left of the laptop is going to cut

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.080 
the left of the laptop is going to cut
into<00:05:05.870> your<00:05:05.900> wrists<00:05:06.820> there<00:05:07.820> are<00:05:07.970> different

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
into your wrists there are different

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.150 
into your wrists there are different
layers<00:05:08.510> there<00:05:08.960> are<00:05:09.050> two<00:05:09.290> methods<00:05:09.530> i<00:05:09.830> can<00:05:10.010> think

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
layers there are two methods i can think

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.710 
layers there are two methods i can think
you<00:05:10.340> can<00:05:10.490> overcome<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:11.090> if<00:05:11.300> you're<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.480> heavy

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
you can overcome this if you're a heavy

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.900 
you can overcome this if you're a heavy
typer<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.800> can<00:05:13.010> either<00:05:13.190> get<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.490> separate

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
typer you can either get a separate

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.600 
typer you can either get a separate
keyboard<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.510> connected<00:05:14.960> via<00:05:15.560> bluetooth<00:05:15.860> or

keyboard and connected via bluetooth or
Wi-Fi<00:05:17.360> or<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:19.160> can<00:05:19.310> get<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.640> certain<00:05:20.150> kind<00:05:20.480> of

protective<00:05:21.460> soft<00:05:22.460> padding<00:05:23.450> on<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:24.620> area<00:05:24.890> so

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
protective soft padding on this area so

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.310 
protective soft padding on this area so
and<00:05:25.760> people<00:05:26.420> say<00:05:26.450> it'll<00:05:26.720> be<00:05:26.810> it's<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.110> lot<00:05:27.290> more

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
and people say it'll be it's a lot more

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.080 
and people say it'll be it's a lot more
comfortable<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.220> won't<00:05:28.700> really<00:05:28.850> have

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
comfortable and you won't really have

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.570 
comfortable and you won't really have
that<00:05:29.270> problem<00:05:29.630> with<00:05:30.380> prolonged<00:05:30.860> typing<00:05:31.460> on

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
that problem with prolonged typing on

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.970 
that problem with prolonged typing on
this<00:05:31.700> thing<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.150> that<00:05:33.140> is<00:05:33.440> one<00:05:33.740> bad<00:05:33.950> thing

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
this thing so that is one bad thing

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.460 
this thing so that is one bad thing
about<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.760> computer<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:35.360> far<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.960> edges<00:05:36.320> are

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
about the computer so far the edges are

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.130 
about the computer so far the edges are
a<00:05:36.530> bit<00:05:36.770> sharp<00:05:37.160> but<00:05:38.120> there<00:05:38.360> really<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.840> really

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
a bit sharp but there really is really

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.070 
a bit sharp but there really is really
negligible<00:05:40.210> if<00:05:41.210> you<00:05:41.420> if<00:05:41.750> you're<00:05:41.840> not<00:05:41.930> really

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
negligible if you if you're not really

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.720 
negligible if you if you're not really
going<00:05:42.290> to<00:05:42.380> type<00:05:42.560> much<00:05:42.770> besides<00:05:43.010> I<00:05:43.280> can<00:05:43.430> do<00:05:43.550> this

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
going to type much besides I can do this

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.090 
going to type much besides I can do this
but<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.210> thing<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.450> after<00:05:45.320> some<00:05:45.710> time<00:05:45.890> you're

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
but the thing is after some time you're

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.910 
but the thing is after some time you're
going<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.370> really<00:05:46.610> notice<00:05:46.850> it<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.330> trackpad

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
going to really notice it the trackpad

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:57.050 
going to really notice it the trackpad
this<00:05:48.920> track<00:05:49.250> pad<00:05:49.570> this<00:05:50.570> trackpad<00:05:51.290> is<00:05:51.520> amazing
