00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.280
 a base that measures eight meters high 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.350

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.199

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.960
 redeemer was chosen as one of the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.010
 seven wonders of the modern world 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.260
 wow the view no one has risen to the hand 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.610
 to Chris Thomas above that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 they repair because a few months ago it fell 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 a lightning in the hand 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.480
 in reference 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.489
 and let's go up 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.680
 let's go up inside the Christ 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.140
 With everyone 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.040
 these two in each arm and one in the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.040
 head 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.719
 100 meters high 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.719
 at this time 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.000
 in his arm the experience is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.579
 unforgettable is very narrow inside 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.849
 see what material is made of 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:47.890
 granite but they are pure triangulitos to a 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.569
 side when you take off the cloudy look 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.260
 people get excited as they are 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.260
 taking pictures 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.220
 but then it becomes cloudy again and no longer 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.290
 we see 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.840
 hopefully you open to create the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.400
 view 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.400
 we are not here literal 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.510
 getting back 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.510
 they see that it's raining when it rains 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.170
 this year by the hand 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.290
 I say it's super good or if I'm 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.760
 hugging his entire arm 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.760
 and they will have two meters 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.909
 of two Kenyans who have to tie themselves 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.909
 somewhere 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 very little width 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.919
 alchemist 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.280
 because nobody dares to get on this 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.240
 it's already good 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.240
 but
