00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
wasn't very effective however because of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.340 
wasn't very effective however because of
the<00:02:00.390> range<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:01.040> pretty<00:02:02.040> good<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the range that's pretty good that's a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.580 
the range that's pretty good that's a
pretty<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.860> strong<00:02:05.250> point<00:02:05.640> I'd<00:02:05.790> say<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.590> in

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
pretty good strong point I'd say and in

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.910 
pretty good strong point I'd say and in
closing<00:02:08.550> crimson<00:02:09.479> theory<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:12.110> extremely<00:02:13.110> fast

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
closing crimson theory is extremely fast

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.100 
closing crimson theory is extremely fast
and<00:02:14.630> very<00:02:15.630> sharp<00:02:16.020> handling<00:02:16.490> not<00:02:17.490> very<00:02:18.110> good

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
and very sharp handling not very good

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.480 
and very sharp handling not very good
man<00:02:19.410> Alma<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.790> mediocre<00:02:21.180> special<00:02:22.080> weapon

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
man Alma and a mediocre special weapon

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.990 
man Alma and a mediocre special weapon
so<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:24.120> bet<00:02:24.690> Russia<00:02:25.200> would<00:02:25.740> probably<00:02:26.400> put<00:02:26.760> this

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
so a bet Russia would probably put this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.060
