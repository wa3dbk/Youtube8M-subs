00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
I think they might be I just can't see

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.310 
I think they might be I just can't see
them<00:02:46.310> guys<00:02:46.460> because<00:02:46.910> I'm<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> rogue<00:02:47.510> that's<00:02:48.110> why

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
them guys because I'm a rogue that's why

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.440

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
otherwise I would be able to see them

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:59.710 
otherwise I would be able to see them
and<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:51.500> think<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.120> miss<00:02:56.540> them<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:58.720> think

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
and I think so I think miss them I think

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.170 
and I think so I think miss them I think
these<00:02:59.870> three<00:03:00.170> are<00:03:00.430> warrior<00:03:01.430> trainers<00:03:01.940> I'm

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
really not sure but I think they look

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.430 
really not sure but I think they look
like<00:03:04.280> pretty<00:03:05.270> specialized<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.020> everything

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
like pretty specialized and everything

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.550 
like pretty specialized and everything
might<00:03:07.310> be<00:03:07.340> them<00:03:07.700> if<00:03:07.880> not<00:03:08.060> just<00:03:08.510> proceed<00:03:09.020> they

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
might be them if not just proceed they

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.760 
might be them if not just proceed they
should<00:03:09.860> be<00:03:10.570> in<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.780> next<00:03:11.900> area<00:03:12.380> or<00:03:12.470> somewhere
