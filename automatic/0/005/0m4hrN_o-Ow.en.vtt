00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.330
 with the 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 and 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.390
 as you know I am from those pages and 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.369
 they have this enchantment name yes 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.990
 well that it tries because it does not know what 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.640
 has is this table of enchantments that 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.259
 we have in pc brands but now 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.579
 we have underway because of vision then 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.990
 we are not simple we are since 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.510
 it simply serves to charm 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.420
 some things and basically does not have 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.430
 some degree to put the most power or 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.720
 something like that but good are simply 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.670
 very simple treatments 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.010
 in the description write down the entire product 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.219
 they can only be downloaded on the page of the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.180
 brush nevers and on my football page 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.850
 I found what is the latest version 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.160
 will and if you do not have and good 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.230
 how it does for song what is this 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.879
 the settling table possibly more 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.640
 so they are very small materials 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.260
 like what is this obsidian three cubes 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.820
 of obsidian a diamond I was what it is 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.410
 a book you already know how I captured if there is not 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.270
 so much but it's good since we have 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.509
 our super table as simply what 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.490
 what we're going to do is touch the armor or 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.720
 tool that we want to love I think 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.159
 that you're not going to put the swords and the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.579
 armor then 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.590
 I think it can be simply on the table 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.259
 of cupcake as you can see 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.850
 he is already happy and we just do not 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.250
 we would put a cycle that lasts a little longer 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.069
 of what it is being not being enchanted 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.020
 in the swords if someone sing it then 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.630
 basically if it becomes very powerful already 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.390
 that when we touch some way then what 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.399
 it burns and it does more damage not to see 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.060
 to enter here on my sword I think that already 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.310
 shes charmed 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.200
 it says diamond alice in chains 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.840
 then since we have it enchanted 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.050
 let's try it with a super move this 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.270
 does not prevent 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.360
 no no no no no do not enter man the time you 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.700
 passes the damn 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.790
 exposes damn hands put the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.980
 damn food we are going to put you 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.980
 a spa where a baby 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.080
 well we would have what is a super 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.459
 peak and we just touched it and since 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.140
 loves the damned the only thing that makes 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.780
 super enchantment and what fart 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.390
 it exploded apart it 's serious and good 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 it explodes apart from that to see what it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.900
 what else exploits is not good express 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.000
 taste is supermoto the rise of gas 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.739
 little hand up if you liked it 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.080
 well you know I'm Belgian and we 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.080
 we see for the next one a new video by 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.730
 Y 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 yes 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.810
 all right
