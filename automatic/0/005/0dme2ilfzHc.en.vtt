00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.530 

alright<00:00:03.710> this<00:00:04.009> video<00:00:04.220> was<00:00:04.730> inspired<00:00:04.910> because

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
alright this video was inspired because

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.490 
alright this video was inspired because
I<00:00:06.109> was<00:00:06.560> on<00:00:06.710> survivalist<00:00:07.370> boards<00:00:07.670> calm<00:00:08.120> and<00:00:08.500> the

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
I was on survivalist boards calm and the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.600 
I was on survivalist boards calm and the
Dan<00:00:11.050> was<00:00:12.050> talking<00:00:12.080> about<00:00:12.620> a<00:00:12.800> friend<00:00:13.190> he<00:00:13.370> has<00:00:13.490> in

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
Dan was talking about a friend he has in

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.610 
Dan was talking about a friend he has in
the<00:00:13.700> military<00:00:14.210> that<00:00:14.389> uses<00:00:14.660> paracord<00:00:15.349> as

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
the military that uses paracord as

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.210 
the military that uses paracord as
shoelaces<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:17.750> part<00:00:18.259> of<00:00:18.290> the<00:00:18.380> reasoning<00:00:18.829> was

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
shoelaces and part of the reasoning was

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.569 
shoelaces and part of the reasoning was
that<00:00:19.279> you<00:00:20.079> apparently<00:00:21.079> can<00:00:22.009> cut<00:00:22.310> through<00:00:22.550> a

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
that you apparently can cut through a

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.909 
that you apparently can cut through a
zip<00:00:22.880> tie<00:00:23.149> with<00:00:24.079> paracord<00:00:25.930> so<00:00:26.930> this<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
zip tie with paracord so this is the

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.880 
zip tie with paracord so this is the
proof<00:00:28.340> of<00:00:28.430> concept<00:00:28.960> basically<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.649> I<00:00:30.680> have

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
proof of concept basically so I have

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.660 
proof of concept basically so I have
regular<00:00:31.279> zip<00:00:31.700> tie<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.469> tell<00:00:33.469> it's<00:00:33.770> you<00:00:34.520> know

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
regular zip tie to tell it's you know

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.530 
regular zip tie to tell it's you know
just<00:00:35.120> mmm<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.410> for<00:00:36.710> long<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:38.180> I'm<00:00:38.270> just<00:00:38.450> gonna

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
just mmm it for long so I'm just gonna

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.470 
just mmm it for long so I'm just gonna
zip<00:00:38.840> tie<00:00:39.050> these<00:00:39.110> weights<00:00:39.590> together<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.450> have

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
zip tie these weights together so I have

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.890 
zip tie these weights together so I have
some<00:00:41.780> area<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.290> saw<00:00:42.710> through<00:00:46.690> okay

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.650 

all<00:00:50.900> right<00:00:51.050> it's<00:00:51.380> a<00:00:51.440> regular<00:00:51.770> zip<00:00:51.980> tie<00:00:52.660> then

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
all right it's a regular zip tie then

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.250 
all right it's a regular zip tie then
I've<00:00:53.780> got<00:00:53.989> 550<00:00:54.620> paracord<00:00:56.140> see<00:00:57.140> it's<00:00:58.930> 32<00:00:59.930> inches

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
I've got 550 paracord see it's 32 inches

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.000 
I've got 550 paracord see it's 32 inches
or<00:01:00.500> something<00:01:00.710> like<00:01:00.770> that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
or something like that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.910 
or something like that
33<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:01.910> don't<00:01:02.899> know<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.230> doesn't<00:01:03.410> really<00:01:03.530> matter

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
33 I don't know it doesn't really matter

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.060 
33 I don't know it doesn't really matter
um<00:01:04.509> just<00:01:05.509> proof<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.840> concept<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.380> mean<00:01:06.560> your

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
um just proof of concept I mean your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.380 
um just proof of concept I mean your
shoelaces<00:01:07.460> would<00:01:07.729> be<00:01:07.850> longer<00:01:08.120> than<00:01:08.300> this

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
shoelaces would be longer than this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:21.550 
shoelaces would be longer than this
anyway<00:01:09.280> alright<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:19.330> here<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.110> see<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.350> got<00:01:21.530> it

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
anyway alright so here you see I got it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.000 
anyway alright so here you see I got it
running<00:01:21.799> underneath<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.370> zip<00:01:22.580> tie<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:24.010> I'll

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
running underneath the zip tie and I'll

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:34.109 
running underneath the zip tie and I'll
see<00:01:25.190> how<00:01:25.340> long<00:01:25.370> it<00:01:25.640> takes<00:01:25.790> me<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.940> saw<00:01:26.240> through

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.950 

all<00:01:35.119> right<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.250> couple<00:01:37.400> seconds<00:01:37.960> you

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
all right so just a couple seconds you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440 
all right so just a couple seconds you
can<00:01:39.080> see<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.500> ends<00:01:40.190> are<00:01:40.340> broken<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.330> they're

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
can see the ends are broken and they're

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.480 
can see the ends are broken and they're
actually<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.810> little<00:01:41.990> tapered<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:43.100> can<00:01:43.280> see

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
actually a little tapered you can see

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.240 
actually a little tapered you can see
that<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:45.680> definitely<00:01:45.830> melted<00:01:46.369> through<00:01:46.659> it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
that it definitely melted through it

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.469 
that it definitely melted through it
smells<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.670> know<00:01:49.820> melted<00:01:50.720> plastic<00:01:52.299> how<00:01:53.299> well

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
smells you know melted plastic how well

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.870 
smells you know melted plastic how well
this<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.630> working<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:54.170> confined<00:01:55.010> space<00:01:55.189> if<00:01:55.820> you

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
this is working a confined space if you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.840 
this is working a confined space if you
were<00:01:56.180> actually<00:01:57.369> handcuffed<00:01:58.369> was<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.549> zip<00:01:58.670> ties

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
were actually handcuffed was a zip ties

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.080 
were actually handcuffed was a zip ties
I<00:01:59.030> don't<00:01:59.150> really<00:01:59.299> know<00:02:00.189> but<00:02:01.189> yeah<00:02:01.729> it

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
I don't really know but yeah it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.960 
I don't really know but yeah it
definitely<00:02:02.330> works<00:02:03.009> so<00:02:04.009> point<00:02:04.610> proven

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
definitely works so point proven

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.580 
definitely works so point proven
you<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.420> saw<00:02:05.750> through<00:02:05.780> zip<00:02:06.200> tie<00:02:06.380> with

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
you can saw through zip tie with

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.130 
you can saw through zip tie with
paracord
