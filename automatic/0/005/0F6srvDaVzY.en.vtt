popping out of the camera lately and I

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.470 
popping out of the camera lately and I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
don't know how it's been happening it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.990 
don't know how it's been happening it
took<00:00:30.689> me<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:31.140> horse<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.279> right

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
took me some horse to get it out right

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.170 
took me some horse to get it out right
now<00:00:33.559> but<00:00:34.559> um<00:00:35.329> it<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.600> didn't<00:00:38.180> before

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
now but um it really didn't before

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
now but um it really didn't before
because<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.110> using<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.649> camcorder<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
because I was just using my camcorder I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.130 
because I was just using my camcorder I
put<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.670> down<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> pick<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.840> I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
put it down I pick it back up and I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
put it down I pick it back up and I'm
like<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> heck<00:00:44.129> happened<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> lens

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
like what the heck happened to the lens

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.750 
like what the heck happened to the lens
so<00:00:46.670> yeah<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.210> lens<00:00:48.539> came<00:00:49.289> out<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.160> seems<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so yeah the lens came out it seems that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.689 
so yeah the lens came out it seems that
you<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.449> there's<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.410> little

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
you see there there's this one little

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.110 
you see there there's this one little
green<00:00:53.699> prong<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.690> seems<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:56.090> shorter<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
green prong that seems to be shorter and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.990 
green prong that seems to be shorter and
looks<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:58.170> somehow<00:00:58.770> broke<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.760> that's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
looks like some somehow broke so that's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
looks like some somehow broke so that's
a<00:01:00.210> downside<00:01:00.930> major<00:01:01.620> downside<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
a downside major downside to the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.670 
a downside major downside to the
camcorder<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.719> seems<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.739> changes<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
camcorder it seems like it changes the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
camcorder it seems like it changes the
macro<00:01:07.680> capabilities<00:01:08.240> because<00:01:09.240> i'm<00:01:09.540> pretty

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
macro capabilities because i'm pretty

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
macro capabilities because i'm pretty
sure<00:01:10.049> i<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.439> usually<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.950> able<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> go

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sure i would usually be able to go

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
sure i would usually be able to go
closer<00:01:13.250> i'm<00:01:14.250> not<00:01:14.400> sure<00:01:14.460> exactly<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:16.159> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
closer i'm not sure exactly but that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
closer i'm not sure exactly but that
might<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> case<00:01:17.790> i'll<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> back<00:01:18.900> on

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
might be the case i'll put it back on

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.130 
might be the case i'll put it back on
and<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> seems<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.240> snap<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:24.110> well<00:01:25.110> i

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and it seems to just snap back in well i

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
and it seems to just snap back in well i
can't<00:01:25.470> give<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> snap<00:01:26.280> back<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
can't give it to snap back in but it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.670 
can't give it to snap back in but it
snapped<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.950> before<00:01:29.299> it<00:01:30.299> um<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
snapped back in before it um and it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.990 
snapped back in before it um and it
keeps<00:01:32.220> coming<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:34.020> constantly<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.729> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
keeps coming out like constantly so it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
keeps coming out like constantly so it's
really<00:01:36.270> annoying<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.380> big

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
really annoying that's a really big

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.620 
really annoying that's a really big
downside<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.750> camcorder<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.119> i<00:01:42.119> might

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
downside to the camcorder and i might

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.139 
downside to the camcorder and i might
have<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.079> send<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.220> guys<00:01:44.640> thank<00:01:45.000> you
