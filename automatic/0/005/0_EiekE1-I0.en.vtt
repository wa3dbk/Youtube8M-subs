 yes sometimes I come in with someone 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.860
 Collision can feel clash 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 for example if you state that faith 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.219
 is an act of man 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.219
 travel all 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.860
 but faith is still an act of the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.860
 man 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.829
 every Sunday evening in the evening shift 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.020
 we confess with the church of all ages 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.020
 i believe in god the father 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.309
 very personal 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.190
 we all know the beautiful 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.499
 believe and know and trust i know and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.499

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:57.569
 man's act may go through that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.460
 martin luther beautifully said god goes with 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:05.700
 us to down on his promise and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.770
 we are not going the other way with him then to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.320
 modes of faith faith as one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 hope a personal matter 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.550
 faith is a divine command the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.830
 but two things later than that 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:29.010
 to hold 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.870
 the requirement of faith and the promise 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 promise dating give the same much 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.990
 to work myself and to rich the ice 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.690
 want people to be pointed out 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.390
 responsibility 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:47.880
 what is believing you surrender to that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.520
 harmless faith is the refuge 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.580
 to a jesus christ 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.470
 harmless and at the same time believe that 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.060
 opt for refuge int 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.060
 may the security finds in is one 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.600
 everything flies into the hands of Christ 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.929
 the re jesus has our salvation 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.209
 hidden is a type of suffering 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.379
 in which he exclaimed on the cross it is 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.810
 full of threads 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.849
 lies in the same hand on the application 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.760
 he groped 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.530
 he serves it how you do it 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.530
 the word and the holy spirit 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.180
 therefore it is the work of the holy spirit 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.790
 to be in the heart of one without the faith 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 to generate 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.200
 Therefore I say at the same time is called 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.030
 believing is a gift of god 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.030
 fruit of the work of the holy spirit 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.420

 the own debt is lost 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.530
 He is the cause 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.650

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.000
 that's a miracle god commands it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.500

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:31.410
 before that the belief in jesus 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:36.380
