00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
pretty much all they did was they just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.950 
pretty much all they did was they just
gave<00:01:38.700> us<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.000> glimpse<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> specs<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
gave us a glimpse of the specs and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.300 
gave us a glimpse of the specs and
everything<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.560> i<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.740> remember<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
everything and if i can remember off the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.270 
everything and if i can remember off the
back<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.820> gonna<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.450> 120<00:01:43.320> hertz<00:01:43.950> per

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
back it's gonna have like 120 hertz per

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
back it's gonna have like 120 hertz per
second<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:45.060> refresh<00:01:45.570> rate<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.110> that's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
second we refresh rate I think that's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
second we refresh rate I think that's
what<00:01:46.439> its<00:01:46.680> gonna<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> nineteen

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
what its gonna have like a nineteen

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.359 
what its gonna have like a nineteen
eighty<00:01:47.970> x<00:01:48.149> 1080p<00:01:48.659> sort<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> resolution<00:01:49.860> you're

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
eighty x 1080p sort of resolution you're

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.219 
eighty x 1080p sort of resolution you're
gonna<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.640> able<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> fit<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.960> head

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
gonna be able to fit it on to your head

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
gonna be able to fit it on to your head
and<00:01:52.259> its<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> comes<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.820> 3d

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and its think it comes with like 3d

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.310 
and its think it comes with like 3d
audio<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.259> were

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
audio I think that was what they were

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.630 
audio I think that was what they were
saying<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> specs<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.460> can't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
saying some of the specs of it I can't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
saying some of the specs of it I can't
exactly<00:01:56.880> remember<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> am<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.780> leave<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
exactly remember but I am gonna leave a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
exactly remember but I am gonna leave a
link<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.579> description<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> video<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
link in the description to a video that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
link in the description to a video that
short<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> showcases<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> specs<00:02:02.909> of

short of showcases all of the specs of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.310 
short of showcases all of the specs of
it<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.299> way<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> guys<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.689> check<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> out

it that way you guys can check it out

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.990 
it that way you guys can check it out
and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> thought<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.280> actually<00:02:05.549> pretty

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and I thought this was actually pretty

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.310 
and I thought this was actually pretty
worthy<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.540> talking<00:02:06.689> about<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> video

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
worthy of talking about in the video

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
worthy of talking about in the video
because<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.580> cool<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
because I think this is pretty cool and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
because I think this is pretty cool and
it's<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.660> crazy<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.319> how<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:11.160> 10<00:02:11.430> years

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it's just crazy to see how like 10 years

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.880 
it's just crazy to see how like 10 years
ago<00:02:12.530> hdmi<00:02:13.530> all

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
ago hdmi all

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.590 
ago hdmi all
of<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.100> stuff<00:02:14.370> was<00:02:14.640> an<00:02:14.850> exact<00:02:15.210> wasn't

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
of this stuff was an exact wasn't

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.900 
of this stuff was an exact wasn't
thought<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.200> USB<00:02:16.890> 3.0<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.760> even

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
thought of like it USB 3.0 is not even

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.670 
thought of like it USB 3.0 is not even
thought<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.750> stuff<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.440> cool

thought of like all this stuff it's cool
to<00:02:19.800> see<00:02:19.950> how<00:02:19.980> fast<00:02:20.400> technology<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:21.330> advanced

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to see how fast technology is advanced

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.840 
to see how fast technology is advanced
in<00:02:21.870> how<00:02:22.080> cool<00:02:22.440> how<00:02:23.130> we're<00:02:23.340> getting<00:02:23.459> all<00:02:23.730> this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
in how cool how we're getting all this

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.880 
in how cool how we're getting all this
new<00:02:24.030> technology<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.810> stuff<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.709> think

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
new technology and stuff and I think

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.770 
new technology and stuff and I think
this<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.040> gonna<00:02:26.190> be<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> big<00:02:26.880> step<00:02:27.240> forward<00:02:27.660> for

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
this is gonna be a big step forward for

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.970 
this is gonna be a big step forward for
gaming<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.440> actually<00:02:28.530> gonna<00:02:28.800> give<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
gaming and it's actually gonna give a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.010 
gaming and it's actually gonna give a
lot<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.160> people<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.610> reason<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.970> buy<00:02:30.150> ps4<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.900> now

they create some FPS games for it though
because<00:03:03.180> i<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:03.660> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> be

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
because i think that's going to be

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.960 
because i think that's going to be
pretty<00:03:04.110> cool<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.769> imagine<00:03:04.890> being<00:03:05.850> able

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
pretty cool but just imagine being able

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
the explosions gunshots RPGs I think

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.210 
the explosions gunshots RPGs I think
that'd<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.850> crazy<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.500> yeah<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:19.890> said<00:03:20.070> let

out let me know do you guys think it's

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.420

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
worth paying for as far as the price

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.069 
worth paying for as far as the price
goes<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.850> haven't<00:03:27.150> announced<00:03:27.209> 1<00:03:27.660> i'm<00:03:27.870> gonna

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
goes they haven't announced 1 i'm gonna

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.650 
goes they haven't announced 1 i'm gonna
estimate<00:03:28.730> around<00:03:29.730> three<00:03:30.090> hundred<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.480> four

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
estimate around three hundred to four

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.720 
estimate around three hundred to four
hundred<00:03:30.720> dollars<00:03:30.989> i<00:03:31.500> mean<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.310> not<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
hundred dollars i mean that's not a

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.009 
hundred dollars i mean that's not a
price<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.090> they<00:03:33.420> have<00:03:33.540> said<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:33.900> I'm

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
price that they have said but I'm

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.780 
price that they have said but I'm
guessing<00:03:34.260> that's<00:03:34.920> gonna<00:03:35.130> be<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> price<00:03:35.610> for

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
guessing that's gonna be the price for

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.430 
guessing that's gonna be the price for
something<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.299> because<00:03:36.690> Sony<00:03:37.019> usually

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
something like that because Sony usually

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.960 
something like that because Sony usually
isn't<00:03:37.590> cheap<00:03:37.920> when<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.549> comes<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
isn't cheap when it comes to the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.520 
isn't cheap when it comes to the
accessory<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.630> could<00:03:39.840> see<00:03:39.989> them<00:03:40.140> charging

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
accessory so I could see them charging

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.690 
accessory so I could see them charging
that<00:03:40.620> much<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.950> something<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.549> which

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
that much for something like that which

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.430 
that much for something like that which
I<00:03:41.820> would<00:03:41.970> gladly<00:03:42.060> pay<00:03:42.360> because<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.170> think<00:03:43.230> it's

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
I would gladly pay because I think it's

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.960 
I would gladly pay because I think it's
gonna<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.620> something<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.489> really<00:03:44.820> cool

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
gonna be something really really cool

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060 
gonna be something really really cool
and<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.810> think<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.260> huge<00:03:46.500> step<00:03:46.620> forward<00:03:46.980> for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
and I think it's a huge step forward for

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.740 
and I think it's a huge step forward for
technology<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.030> let<00:03:48.209> me<00:03:48.299> know<00:03:48.390> what<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.630> guys
