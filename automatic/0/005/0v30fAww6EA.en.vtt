 with the testimonies of the native populations of the natives

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.080
 the deep sense 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.080
 of a bond with the earth 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.170
 indigenous peoples 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.040

 feelings

 you see 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.579
 we have to 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.050
 to be conscious 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.050
 that the defense of traditional knowledge 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.560
 a practice 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.310
 who supplies us with tools 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 indispensable for our life 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.799
 abandon the traditional knowledge

 it makes us poorer 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.459
 it makes us weaker 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.390
