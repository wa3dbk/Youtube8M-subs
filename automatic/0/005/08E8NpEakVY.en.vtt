00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.420
 they 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.660
 you 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.860
 Hello everyone and today we will analyze you 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.150
 Here is such a well, not very complicated bra 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.920
 in roads c 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:17.550
 that is, the guitar is tuned in the rumen well 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:20.510
 he plays with us like that here frets 6 4 2 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:28.640
 and 1 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.640
 I again grant all of them here 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:45.460
 here we will do this movement on each 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:55.170
 fret well, rather, on the sixth on the fourth in 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 the author remembers this movement 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.920
 and 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:29.569
 once again as slowly as possible just 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.569
 clamped three upper strings 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.710
 and 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.690
 and 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.960
 and 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.700
 and again 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.540
 principle is not as important as you are 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.709
 you will play reefs that is invented again 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.000
 by me therefore how you collect it so 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.340
 will be the right drummer who i am 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.780
 used in this reef will be a reference 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:07.530
 under the video there you download well completely 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.570
 a bunch of several drummers and find 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 this one is not so much there 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.070
 good luck to you all 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.989
 but listen again how it will be 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.989
 sound with a drummer 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.199
 and
