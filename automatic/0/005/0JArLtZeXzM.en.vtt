goes<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.620> the<00:00:28.740> game<00:00:29.870> so<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.219> PSP<00:00:32.730> overall<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
goes in the game so the PSP overall is a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860 
goes in the game so the PSP overall is a
really<00:00:34.800> good<00:00:34.980> system<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.519> my<00:00:35.670> opinion<00:00:35.870> much

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
really good system in my opinion much

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.829 
really good system in my opinion much
better<00:00:37.170> than<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> DS<00:00:37.859> or<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.519> DSi<00:00:38.969> ever<00:00:39.329> could

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
better than the DS or the DSi ever could

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.110 
better than the DS or the DSi ever could
hope<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.409> because<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.460> used<00:00:41.609> to<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.789> it<00:00:41.940> yes

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
hope to be because I used to have it yes

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.579 
hope to be because I used to have it yes
like<00:00:42.359> but<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.289> broken<00:00:43.499> now<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.269> anyway<00:00:45.269> I

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
like but it's broken now but anyway I

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.880 
like but it's broken now but anyway I
like<00:00:46.589> it<00:00:47.089> it's<00:00:48.089> got<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:48.960> capabilities

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
like it it's got very good capabilities

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.360 
like it it's got very good capabilities
it<00:00:50.760> plays<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.059> undies<00:00:51.829> which<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.069> don't<00:00:53.190> think

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it plays your undies which I don't think

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.579 
it plays your undies which I don't think
you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.999> record<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.079> anything<00:00:55.289> like

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
you can record them or anything like

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.270 
you can record them or anything like
that<00:00:55.879> but<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:58.019> problem<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.159> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that but the problem with them is that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.169 
that but the problem with them is that
they're<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.210> big<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.929> mean<00:01:01.499> they're<00:01:02.069> like<00:01:02.190> 2

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
they're really big I mean they're like 2

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.420 
they're really big I mean they're like 2
inches<00:01:03.569> across<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> size<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
inches across this is the size of a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
inches across this is the size of a
normal<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.450> like

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
normal one and as you can see it's like

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
normal one and as you can see it's like
probably<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.430> thumb<00:01:11.700> look<00:01:12.420> at

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
probably like this is my thumb look at

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.190 
probably like this is my thumb look at
it<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.719> way<00:01:13.040> it's<00:01:14.040> huge

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
it this way it's huge

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
it this way it's huge
and<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.979> delicate<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.610> mean<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and it's pretty delicate I mean this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
and it's pretty delicate I mean this
thing<00:01:19.110> probably<00:01:19.380> wouldn't<00:01:19.770> survive<00:01:19.860> more

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
thing probably wouldn't survive more

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.660 
thing probably wouldn't survive more
than<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> couple<00:01:21.360> drops<00:01:21.630> or<00:01:21.930> anything<00:01:22.670> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
than like a couple drops or anything and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
than like a couple drops or anything and
also<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.329> touch<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.869> spot<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
also if you touch that spot then it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.929 
also if you touch that spot then it
could<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> messed<00:01:26.219> up<00:01:26.399> right<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:27.409> but

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
could get messed up right there but

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.580 
could get messed up right there but
anyway<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.390> PSP<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.439> good<00:01:31.590> games<00:01:31.859> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
anyway the PSP has really good games and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.899 
anyway the PSP has really good games and
it<00:01:35.180> yeah<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.359> works<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.899> guess<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
it yeah it works for me I guess I

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.840 
it yeah it works for me I guess I
recommend<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.210> older<00:01:39.689> kids<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.289> I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
recommend it for older kids because I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
recommend it for older kids because I
mean<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.359> drop<00:01:42.719> it<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.560> probably

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
mean if you drop it then it's probably

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
mean if you drop it then it's probably
gonna<00:01:43.950> shatter<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.640> something<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.329> least

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
gonna shatter or something or at least

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
gonna shatter or something or at least
that's<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.929> feels<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.609> don't

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that's what it feels like and I don't

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550 
that's what it feels like and I don't
think<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.299> your<00:01:48.450> 4<00:01:48.780> year<00:01:48.810> old<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.530> be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
think you want your 4 year old to be

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440 
think you want your 4 year old to be
breaking<00:01:49.950> something<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.969> just<00:01:51.179> spend

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
breaking something now you just spend

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.260 
breaking something now you just spend
200<00:01:51.810> bucks<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> internet<00:01:54.539> browser<00:01:56.270> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
200 bucks on the internet browser it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.870 
200 bucks on the internet browser it's
pretty<00:01:57.749> slow<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.439> mean<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.979> can't<00:01:59.189> expect<00:01:59.609> much

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pretty slow I mean you can't expect much

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.060 
pretty slow I mean you can't expect much
from<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.679> gaming

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
from it because it's like a gaming

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.560 
from it because it's like a gaming
machine<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.179> supposed<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
machine that's what you're supposed to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.700 
machine that's what you're supposed to
expect<00:02:04.249> but<00:02:05.249> you<00:02:05.579> know<00:02:06.359> it<00:02:06.689> loads<00:02:07.079> things<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
expect but you know it loads things it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.780 
expect but you know it loads things it
loads<00:02:07.950> images<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.610> stuff<00:02:08.880> pretty<00:02:09.420> well<00:02:10.790> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
loads images and stuff pretty well the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.200 
loads images and stuff pretty well the
game<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:14.310> ok<00:02:14.730> it's

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
game is it's ok it's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.870 
game is it's ok it's
pretty<00:02:15.390> entertaining<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
pretty entertaining it's and the

pretty entertaining it's and the
graphics<00:02:18.270> are<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.510> exactly<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> ps2

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
symbol on instead and instead of the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.370 
symbol on instead and instead of the
ring<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.910> like<00:03:17.970> smaller<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.020> chrome

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
ring it's like smaller it's a chrome

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.050 
ring it's like smaller it's a chrome
ring<00:03:19.650> inside<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.130> brush<00:03:20.490> metal<00:03:20.700> thing

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
ring inside of that brush metal thing

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.330 
ring inside of that brush metal thing
that<00:03:22.050> got<00:03:22.230> scratched<00:03:22.590> really<00:03:22.860> easily<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that got scratched really easily and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.700 
that got scratched really easily and
it's<00:03:24.090> also<00:03:24.240> like<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> matte<00:03:24.900> finish<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.560> it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
it's also like a matte finish so it's

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.190 
it's also like a matte finish so it's
not<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> fingerprint<00:03:26.850> magnet<00:03:27.030> anymore

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

not really a fingerprint magnet anymore
which<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.850> mean<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.720> depends<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.290> your

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
which I like I mean it depends on your

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.520 
which I like I mean it depends on your
taste<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.900> also<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:36.450> UMD<00:03:36.930> drive<00:03:36.960> comes

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
taste and also the the UMD drive comes

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.450 
taste and also the the UMD drive comes
out<00:03:37.710> like<00:03:37.890> this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
out like this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.250 
out like this
I'm<00:03:38.910> not<00:03:39.270> sure<00:03:39.420> if<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> would<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:39.990> that<00:03:40.140> on

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
I'm not sure if it would like that on

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.440 
I'm not sure if it would like that on
the<00:03:40.350> slim<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:40.800> not<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:42.210> know<00:03:44.210> there's<00:03:45.210> one

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
the slim or not but you know there's one

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.930 
the slim or not but you know there's one
other<00:03:45.630> thing<00:03:45.960> I<00:03:46.110> don't<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.440> about<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:47.100> PSP

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940

thing the fact that they see you on D
Drive<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:52.080> like<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.250> sounds<00:03:53.490> like<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> fan<00:03:54.060> while

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
Drive it like it sounds like a fan while

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.080 
Drive it like it sounds like a fan while
you're<00:03:54.510> playing<00:03:54.690> sometimes<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:56.430> takes<00:03:56.940> a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
you're playing sometimes it takes a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.170 
you're playing sometimes it takes a
while<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.570> load<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.080> stuff<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.620> also<00:03:59.580> while

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
while to load and stuff and also while

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.490 
while to load and stuff and also while
you're<00:04:00.270> playing<00:04:00.480> games<00:04:00.750> sometimes<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.380> get

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
you're playing games sometimes we get

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.870 
you're playing games sometimes we get
this<00:04:01.680> whirring<00:04:02.670> sound<00:04:03.740> but<00:04:04.740> like<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.640> worth

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
this whirring sound but like it's worth

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.060 
this whirring sound but like it's worth
it<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.240> think<00:04:06.540> because<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.500> gameplay<00:04:07.710> is<00:04:07.980> just

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
it I think because the gameplay is just

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.570 
it I think because the gameplay is just
amazing<00:04:08.790> compared<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.080> most<00:04:10.890> handhelds

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
amazing compared to like most handhelds

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.660 
amazing compared to like most handhelds
on<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.820> market<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.680> by<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.890> way<00:04:14.100> if<00:04:14.370> you're

deciding<00:04:15.450> between<00:04:15.540> this<00:04:16.290> one<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.010> PSP<00:04:17.370> go

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.190 
deciding between this one and the PSP go
get<00:04:18.390> this<00:04:18.750> one<00:04:19.020> because<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:20.430> PSP<00:04:20.880> go<00:04:21.120> yeah<00:04:22.049> it
