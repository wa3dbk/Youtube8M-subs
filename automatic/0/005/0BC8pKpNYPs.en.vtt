00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
looks like this model from comic-con
which<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.690> cut<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.039> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
which I cut I actually really like this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
which I cut I actually really like this
model<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
model you know we don't get to see it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
model you know we don't get to see it
the<00:01:04.320> majority<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> his<00:01:05.100> body<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.909> no

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the majority of his body it's all no

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
the majority of his body it's all no
outline<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> nice<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.830> vicia

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
outline but we get a nice little vicia

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
outline but we get a nice little vicia
jevon<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.350> awesome

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
jevon and I think it's really awesome

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.840 
jevon and I think it's really awesome
and<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:12.720> know<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> cool

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and you know it's just it's just so cool

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
and you know it's just it's just so cool
and<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.750> fact<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> only<00:01:16.049> reason<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.470> actually

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and in fact the only reason I'm actually

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
and in fact the only reason I'm actually
was<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> pic<00:01:17.520> earlier<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
was using that pic earlier because it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
was using that pic earlier because it
was<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> USA<00:01:19.049> Today<00:01:19.350> website<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
was on the USA Today website so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460 
was on the USA Today website so
apparently<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.820> okay<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> use<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
apparently it's okay to use that one of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
apparently it's okay to use that one of
major<00:01:23.159> company<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.610> men<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.000> eating<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.240> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
major company like men was eating it but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
major company like men was eating it but
ok<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:26.430> seems<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.740> trait

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
ok now I it seems like it is the trait

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.260 
ok now I it seems like it is the trait
of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> whole<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.640> leaked<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.090> few

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
of the whole thing that was leaked a few

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
of the whole thing that was leaked a few
months<00:01:30.450> ago<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.619> seems<00:01:31.829> familiar<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
months ago because it seems familiar to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240 
months ago because it seems familiar to
that<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.950> poor

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that and you know it was just so poor

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.710 
that and you know it was just so poor
quality<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> wasn't<00:01:36.060> even<00:01:36.150> gonna<00:01:36.299> say<00:01:36.689> anything

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
quality I wasn't even gonna say anything

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
quality I wasn't even gonna say anything
about<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.009> there's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
about it because I was like there's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.840 
about it because I was like there's
nothing<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.439> apparently<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
nothing here but apparently we got this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
nothing here but apparently we got this
and<00:01:42.210> I'm<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.520> I'm<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.579> flat-out<00:01:45.299> no<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and I'm just I'm just flat-out no just

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.380 
and I'm just I'm just flat-out no just
odd<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:49.970> visually<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.360> looks

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
odd right now because visually it looks

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.340 
odd right now because visually it looks
really<00:01:51.840> good<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:55.049> they're<00:01:55.200> not

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
really good and you know they're not

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
really good and you know they're not
doing<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.649> thing<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> 98<00:01:56.820> where

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
doing that thing like in 98 where

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.639 
doing that thing like in 98 where
they're<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.329> oh<00:01:57.479> who's<00:01:57.930> we're<00:01:58.320> sure<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
