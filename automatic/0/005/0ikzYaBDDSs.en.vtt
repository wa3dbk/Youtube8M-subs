human sense of smell now obviously this

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.200 
human sense of smell now obviously this
is<00:00:09.809> where<00:00:09.960> smell<00:00:10.290> begins<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.099> nose<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:12.030> all

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
is where smell begins the nose we all

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.999 
is where smell begins the nose we all
know<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> nose<00:00:12.840> acts<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> portal<00:00:13.920> of

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
know that the nose acts as the portal of

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.099 
know that the nose acts as the portal of
entry<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> sense<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.000> smell<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.570> we
