00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
everyone so today I'm going to discuss

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.160 
everyone so today I'm going to discuss
food<00:00:04.980> safe<00:00:05.370> methods<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.270> treating<00:00:06.600> water<00:00:06.930> in

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
food safe methods of treating water in

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.110 
food safe methods of treating water in
aquaponics<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.400> other<00:00:08.519> systems<00:00:09.030> that

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
aquaponics and other systems that

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
aquaponics and other systems that
contain<00:00:09.510> fish<00:00:09.809> or<00:00:09.990> plants<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.440> are<00:00:10.620> intended

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
contain fish or plants that are intended

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.570 
contain fish or plants that are intended
for<00:00:11.160> human<00:00:11.280> consumption<00:00:12.950> what<00:00:13.950> sparked<00:00:14.309> me<00:00:14.460> to

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
for human consumption what sparked me to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.310 
for human consumption what sparked me to
make<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.910> video<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.109> seen<00:00:16.289> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
make this video is that I've seen a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.990 
make this video is that I've seen a
number<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.710> videos<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.220> YouTube<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> people

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
number of videos on YouTube of people

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.550 
number of videos on YouTube of people
adding<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.480> chlorinators<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.439> other

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
adding the chlorinators and other

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.990 
adding the chlorinators and other
products<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.250> available<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.880> pet

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
products that are available at pet

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.950 
products that are available at pet
stores<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.570> their<00:00:21.689> aquaponic<00:00:22.289> systems<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
stores to their aquaponic systems and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.359 
stores to their aquaponic systems and
doing<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.260> really<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> good<00:00:26.070> idea

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
doing this is really not a good idea

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.250 
doing this is really not a good idea
because<00:00:26.580> many<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.150> products<00:00:27.630> contain

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
because many of these products contain

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.320 
because many of these products contain
chemicals<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.070> substances<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:29.820> toxic

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
chemicals and substances that are toxic

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.510 
chemicals and substances that are toxic
to<00:00:30.359> humans<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.080> they<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.980> should<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.340> be

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
to humans and they really should not be

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760 
to humans and they really should not be
ingested<00:00:32.850> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.870> read<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> labels

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
ingested if you read some of the labels

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
ingested if you read some of the labels
they<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> warning<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.090> have

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
they have this warning that I have

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
they have this warning that I have
written<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.260> ornamental<00:00:38.160> fish<00:00:38.610> use

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
written here for ornamental fish use

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
written here for ornamental fish use
only<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.110> used<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.559> fish<00:00:40.770> intended<00:00:41.309> for

only not to be used on fish intended for
human<00:00:41.790> consumption<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.520> only<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.850> these

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
human consumption so not only can these

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
human consumption so not only can these
chemicals<00:00:45.450> contaminate<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> fish<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> your

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
chemicals contaminate the fish in your

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
chemicals contaminate the fish in your
system<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.340> also<00:00:47.489> accumulate<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
system but they can also accumulate in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.150 
system but they can also accumulate in
the<00:00:48.510> plants<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.020> you're<00:00:49.140> growing<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:50.010> can

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the plants that you're growing they can

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.319 
the plants that you're growing they can
lead<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> human<00:00:50.670> disease<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.149> they're

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
lead to human disease if they're

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
lead to human disease if they're
chronically<00:00:51.690> ingested<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.590> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
chronically ingested so I'm not going to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.310 
chronically ingested so I'm not going to
go<00:00:55.890> over<00:00:56.449> ingredients<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.629> specific<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
go over ingredients that are specific to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
go over ingredients that are specific to
each<00:00:58.350> product<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.030> easily<00:01:00.210> find

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
each product because you can easily find

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.689 
each product because you can easily find
this<00:01:00.690> information<00:01:01.260> online<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.550> want

store D chlorinators now I don't know
what<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.290> chemicals<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> I'm

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
what a lot of these chemicals do and I'm

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
what a lot of these chemicals do and I'm
sure<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.900> them<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.290> probably<00:01:13.500> not

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
sure that some of them are probably not

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.859 
sure that some of them are probably not
toxic<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.330> specific

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.380 
toxic but there is one specific

used on fish intended for human

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
used on fish intended for human
consumption<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.210> good

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
consumption I think it's a really good

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.660 
consumption I think it's a really good
idea<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.840> follow<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.200> warning<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.130> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
idea to follow this warning because you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.590 
idea to follow this warning because you
really<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.299> eating

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
really don't want to be eating

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
really don't want to be eating
formaldehyde<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.439> obviously<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:47.159> good<00:01:47.460> for

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
formaldehyde it's obviously not good for

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.219 
formaldehyde it's obviously not good for
you<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.240> something<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.780> used<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you that's something that's used in

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.480 
you that's something that's used in
preserving<00:01:50.810> bodies<00:01:51.810> after<00:01:52.200> their<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.920> after

you<00:01:56.130> should<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.490> eating<00:01:56.729> while<00:01:57.030> you're<00:01:57.090> still

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
you should be eating while you're still

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
you should be eating while you're still
alive<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> many<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:01.920> probably

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
alive so many of you are probably

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249 
alive so many of you are probably
wondering<00:02:02.460> well<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.689> let<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.079> water

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
wondering well can I just let my water

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
wondering well can I just let my water
sit<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.710> overnight<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.430> let<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> chlorine

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
sit out overnight and let the chlorine

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.809 
sit out overnight and let the chlorine
evaporate<00:02:06.570> from<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:06.930> tap<00:02:07.110> water<00:02:07.340> well<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:08.700> in

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
evaporate from my tap water well yeah in

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
evaporate from my tap water well yeah in
certain<00:02:09.090> areas<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.379> your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
certain areas you can do this if your

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.960 
certain areas you can do this if your
municipal<00:02:11.129> water<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.550> treated<00:02:11.790> with

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
chloramine which is also toxic to fish

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.930 
chloramine which is also toxic to fish
like<00:02:22.989> chlorine<00:02:23.470> but<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:23.920> more<00:02:24.130> stable<00:02:24.670> and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
like chlorine but it's more stable and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.479 
like chlorine but it's more stable and
it's<00:02:25.290> doesn't<00:02:26.290> evaporate<00:02:26.650> when<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.160> expose

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
it's doesn't evaporate when you expose

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.199 
it's doesn't evaporate when you expose
it<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.700> light<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.120> air<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.569> chlorine<00:02:28.930> does

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
it to light and air like chlorine does

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.970 
it to light and air like chlorine does
so<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.660> live<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.170> Center<00:02:32.709> City<00:02:32.890> Philadelphia

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
so I live in Center City Philadelphia

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.040 
so I live in Center City Philadelphia
and<00:02:33.730> my<00:02:33.970> tap<00:02:34.209> water<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.660> treated<00:02:35.019> with

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
and my tap water is treated with

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.199 
and my tap water is treated with
chloramines<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.519> want<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:36.910> show<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
chloramines and I want to show you the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.030 
chloramines and I want to show you the
way<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.510> remove<00:02:38.200> these<00:02:38.349> chloramines<00:02:38.860> from

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
way that I remove these chloramines from

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.550 
way that I remove these chloramines from
my<00:02:39.160> water<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.940> make<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.090> safe<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:40.390> my<00:02:40.660> fish<00:02:41.230> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
my water to make it safe for my fish and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.009 
my water to make it safe for my fish and
still<00:02:41.950> safe<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:42.880> me<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.060> eat<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.450> plants<00:02:43.930> that

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
still safe for me to eat the plants that

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.870 
still safe for me to eat the plants that
I'm<00:02:44.140> growing<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.530> my<00:02:44.650> aquaponic<00:02:45.220> system<00:02:45.610> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
I'm growing in my aquaponic system and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.170 
I'm growing in my aquaponic system and
to<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.560> do<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.069> rely<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.670> good

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
to do to do this I rely on good

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.160 
to do to do this I rely on good
old-fashioned<00:02:50.580> vitamin<00:02:51.580> C<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.420> vitamin<00:02:55.750> C<00:02:56.019> or

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
old-fashioned vitamin C so vitamin C or

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.620 
old-fashioned vitamin C so vitamin C or
ascorbic<00:02:56.530> acid<00:02:56.560> acts<00:02:57.400> as<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.640> reducing<00:02:58.150> agent

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.190 
ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent
and<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:59.410> dissociates<00:02:59.739> the<00:03:00.489> chloramine<00:03:01.200> into

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
and it dissociates the chloramine into

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.949 
and it dissociates the chloramine into
ammonium<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.069> chloride<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.599> is<00:03:04.720> nice

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
ammonium and chloride so this is nice

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.740 
ammonium and chloride so this is nice
because<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.530> chloride<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.160> then<00:03:06.370> able<00:03:06.519> to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
because the chloride is then able to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.150 
because the chloride is then able to
evaporate<00:03:07.750> from<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.440> water<00:03:08.739> when<00:03:09.040> it's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
evaporate from the water when it's

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.800 
evaporate from the water when it's
exposed<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.700> air<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.910> light<00:03:10.269> if<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.599> let<00:03:10.720> your

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
exposed to air and light if you let your

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.199 
exposed to air and light if you let your
water<00:03:11.019> sit<00:03:11.319> out<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.220> ammonium<00:03:12.610> component

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
water sit out and the ammonium component

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.910 
water sit out and the ammonium component
feeds<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:13.540> into<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.959> nitrogen<00:03:14.410> cycle<00:03:14.440> of

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
feeds right into the nitrogen cycle of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.280 
feeds right into the nitrogen cycle of
the<00:03:15.040> aquarium<00:03:15.340> providing<00:03:16.090> extra<00:03:16.630> nitrogen<00:03:17.110> to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
the aquarium providing extra nitrogen to

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.050 
the aquarium providing extra nitrogen to
the<00:03:17.319> plants<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.959> what<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.440> do<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> break<00:03:22.030> up

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
the plants so what I do is I break up

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.479 
the plants so what I do is I break up
one<00:03:22.510> 500<00:03:22.780> milligram<00:03:23.410> tablet<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.950> vitamin<00:03:24.280> C

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
one 500 milligram tablet of vitamin C

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.910 
one 500 milligram tablet of vitamin C
and<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.060> add<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.450> about<00:03:25.810> 5<00:03:26.079> gallons<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.709> tap

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
and I add it to about 5 gallons of tap

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.819 
and I add it to about 5 gallons of tap
water<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.570> from<00:03:29.019> what<00:03:29.140> I've<00:03:29.260> read<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.650> is

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
water so from what I've read this is

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.789 
water so from what I've read this is
more<00:03:30.250> than<00:03:30.519> enough<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.959> catalyze<00:03:32.590> this

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
more than enough to catalyze this

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.860 
more than enough to catalyze this
reaction<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:35.100> let<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.329> water<00:03:37.329> with<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
reaction and I let the water with the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.930 
reaction and I let the water with the
vitamin<00:03:38.200> C<00:03:38.230> sit<00:03:38.709> out<00:03:38.859> for<00:03:39.100> about<00:03:39.220> 8<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.519> 12

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
vitamin C sit out for about 8 to 12

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.539 
vitamin C sit out for about 8 to 12
hours<00:03:40.090> before<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.720> add<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.140> my<00:03:41.260> system<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> I

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
hours before I add it to my system and I

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.370 
hours before I add it to my system and I
really<00:03:42.790> haven't<00:03:43.060> had<00:03:43.120> any<00:03:43.180> problems<00:03:43.840> yet<00:03:44.049> and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
really haven't had any problems yet and

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.190 
really haven't had any problems yet and
it's<00:03:44.680> been<00:03:44.829> working<00:03:45.010> really<00:03:45.430> great<00:03:45.670> for<00:03:45.910> me

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
it's been working really great for me

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.250 
it's been working really great for me
the<00:03:47.200> only<00:03:47.380> potential<00:03:47.920> problem<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:49.329> you

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
the only potential problem that you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.569 
the only potential problem that you
could<00:03:50.380> have<00:03:50.560> with<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:50.920> method<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.519> that

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
could have with this method is that

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.210 
could have with this method is that
you're<00:03:51.880> introducing<00:03:52.720> small<00:03:53.109> amounts<00:03:54.040> of

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
you're introducing small amounts of

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.460 
you're introducing small amounts of
hydrogen<00:03:54.880> ions<00:03:55.209> or<00:03:55.420> acid<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.930> your<00:03:56.049> system

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
hydrogen ions or acid to your system

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.770 
hydrogen ions or acid to your system
which<00:03:57.010> could<00:03:57.310> slightly<00:03:57.880> lower<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.359> pH<00:03:58.600> in

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
which could slightly lower the pH in

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.270 
which could slightly lower the pH in
your<00:03:58.810> aquarium<00:03:59.139> but<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.739> haven't<00:04:00.040> had<00:04:00.130> any

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
your aquarium but I haven't had any

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.610 
your aquarium but I haven't had any
problems<00:04:00.700> with<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:00.970> yet<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> my<00:04:01.630> pH<00:04:02.380> has

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
problems with this yet and my pH has

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.170 
problems with this yet and my pH has
been<00:04:02.769> steady<00:04:03.069> at<00:04:03.220> 7.0<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.400> drawing<00:04:06.700> shows

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
been steady at 7.0 so this drawing shows

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.900 
been steady at 7.0 so this drawing shows
the<00:04:08.109> reaction<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:08.859> have<00:04:08.950> chloramine<00:04:09.459> plus

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
the reaction so you have chloramine plus

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.509 
the reaction so you have chloramine plus
vitamin<00:04:10.359> c<00:04:10.680> saying<00:04:11.680> goes<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.069> ammonium

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
vitamin c saying goes to ammonium

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.360 
vitamin c saying goes to ammonium
chloride<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.480> i<00:04:13.600> hydrous<00:04:14.019> korvac<00:04:14.470> acid<00:04:14.920> the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
chloride and i hydrous korvac acid the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.250 
chloride and i hydrous korvac acid the
ammonium<00:04:15.850> feeds<00:04:16.120> into<00:04:16.299> your<00:04:16.389> nitrogen<00:04:16.750> cycle

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
ammonium feeds into your nitrogen cycle

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.930 
ammonium feeds into your nitrogen cycle
and<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.709> chloride<00:04:17.950> will<00:04:18.459> eventually

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
and the chloride will eventually

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.070 
and the chloride will eventually
evaporate<00:04:19.209> as<00:04:19.630> chlorine<00:04:19.900> gas<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.020> a

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
evaporate as chlorine gas so this is a

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.570 
evaporate as chlorine gas so this is a
really<00:04:23.349> great<00:04:23.500> way<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.770> de<00:04:24.010> chlorinate<00:04:24.460> your

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
really great way to de chlorinate your

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.600 
really great way to de chlorinate your
water

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
water

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.580 
water
and<00:04:25.699> it's<00:04:26.150> safe<00:04:26.449> for<00:04:26.689> both<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.259> your<00:04:27.349> fish

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
and it's safe for both you and your fish

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.230 
and it's safe for both you and your fish
and<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:27.979> hope<00:04:28.099> you<00:04:28.220> found<00:04:28.340> this<00:04:28.520> video<00:04:28.669> helpful
