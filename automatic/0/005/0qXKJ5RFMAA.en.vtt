00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 Good is good and I hope you all have 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:15.839
 seen the video here today and have 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.260
 liked it from the blog presentations 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.270
 only today in a file see more to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.350
 talk about painting January until 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.939
 time and sought to know and this will 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.199
 a little time in the refrigerator 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.510
 since I need me a little silent 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.750
 what's really cool to be able to go us 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.910
 erase drying because time 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 Cloudy a little slow about 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.899
 refrigerators are taking advantage of the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.129
 of time since I can start 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.739
 pursue this painting 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.399
 now speaking is a subject that thinks 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 generates a bit of doubt that 's how I think 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.730
 that really works with geography is 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 actually do not even want it to be 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.019
 working people who are 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 beginning to tinker with the story and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.640
 geography that do not have a knowledge and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 I want to buy this story. 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.930
 show some of the difference between the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.150
 The school of action of the novel tells 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.110
 story of a simple action one 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.690
 story like this one 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 I'll tell you a bit about this story. 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:35.410
 history is already dupont is the one that has 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.910
 triggered a simple adiação ie 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.790
 negative action that is only down ie 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:49.030
 the simple action where work only 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.460
 leaving the ink can not control 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.460
 out of the ink or the ink control . 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.960
 out of ink or is otherwise 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.340
 it's not the best you need it 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.910
 negative 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:10.540
 pulls behind you control the output in 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:14.100
 ink is more or less ink 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:18.070
 only that simple traction control 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.239
 there is no control and comes from a 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:25.480
 another form of unification 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:32.650
 I 'm just going to show the difference that a miss 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:34.350
 work or even talk about the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.110
 compressors 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.440
 and I think with graceful fashion already 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.290
 changes which type of compressor 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:50.750
 I do not jlg you and what I did not ask and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.550
 I also had this fight and I ended up being 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.120
 buy at the wrong price 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.840
 now I use this converter to gaza 11 and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.770
 architecture of the refrigerator and I ended up 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.570
 buying this radio compressor there 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.620
 We would buy stole day and now what? 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.630
 I do 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.130
 I already bought talking to a person. 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.580
 running to my story and geography 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.640
 that generated the doubt that made wenger already 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.770
 who had a fable is a certain value 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.590
 compressor 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.820
 actually I did not have 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.950
 I bought two compressors confessed 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.980
 very heavy very very noisy 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.750
 big that in the end I would sell if 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:47.430
 compressor and bought a non-compressor 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.250
 It worked for me, I did not do it and even 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.940
 buy the oppressor currently today 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.680
 use of radiography 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.610
 although I also do not stop using the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.640
 compressor that I bought wrong then 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.060
 compressor is something that generates 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.660
 doubt people will have doubts in 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.300
 the type of compressor and the pen 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.610
 ideal for working 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.830
 Should I have a situation 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.220
 Do I have to have an action? 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.450
 simple or people will have this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.840
 doubt 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:29.130
 So this class today is just 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:33.210
 to break the promise doubts and show 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.759
 Why each one? 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.550
 I hope you guys obviously like it. 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.789
 I than in other classes will assemble 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.099
 pen is going to talk a little too of 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:48.210
 how to clean this pen how do you 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:51.419
 is to clean the pen with the process 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.500
 richness of the pen that generates none 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:59.370
 doubt 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:05.539
 then I hope you enjoy and even to the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.539
 beginning of the new season
