00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
approximately ten years to build so it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.590 
approximately ten years to build so it
took<00:00:57.809> quite<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> time<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.039> build<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600

this golf course is just a challenging
golf<00:01:02.879> course<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.710> initial<00:01:04.949> layout<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.820> 70

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240

200<00:01:06.420> yards<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.439> tip<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> was

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
200 yards from the tip so when it was

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.109 
200 yards from the tip so when it was
built<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> designed<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:10.979> every<00:01:11.909> hole

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
built and designed so I think every hole

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
built and designed so I think every hole
is<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.500> totally<00:01:13.500> unique<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.040> far<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.400> layout

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
is just totally unique as far as layout

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
is just totally unique as far as layout
in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> concept<00:01:15.689> no<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.619> look<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
in the concept no to really look the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
in the concept no to really look the
same<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> views<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> get

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
same and then the views that you get

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.820 
same and then the views that you get
from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.920> elevation<00:01:20.549> changes<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.110> 96

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
from the elevation changes and it has 96

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
from the elevation changes and it has 96
sand<00:01:23.189> traps<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> lot<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> water

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
sand traps on it with a lot of water

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
sand traps on it with a lot of water
hazards<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.610> ponds<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> natural<00:01:27.780> streams

hazards from ponds and natural streams

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
hazards from ponds and natural streams
and<00:01:28.439> everything<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and everything so I think that's the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
and everything so I think that's the
great<00:01:31.170> thing<00:01:31.520> even<00:01:32.520> though<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.850> designed

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
great thing even though it was designed

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
great thing even though it was designed
in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> 60s<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.110> built<00:01:34.380> through<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> 70s<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
in the 60s and built through the 70s and

opening around nineteen eighty it's not

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.719
