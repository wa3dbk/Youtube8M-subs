for<00:00:33.000> automotive<00:00:33.420> applications<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> problem

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
for automotive applications the problem

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
for automotive applications the problem
is<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.730> these<00:00:35.880> solutions<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:37.140> not

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
is that that these solutions do not

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.840 
is that that these solutions do not
satisfy<00:00:37.440> automotive<00:00:38.100> requirements<00:00:38.670> they

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
satisfy automotive requirements they

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
satisfy automotive requirements they
don't<00:00:39.059> good<00:00:39.270> quickly<00:00:39.600> enough<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:40.530> are

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
don't good quickly enough there are

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
don't good quickly enough there are
security<00:00:40.860> concerns<00:00:41.550> safety<00:00:41.969> concerns<00:00:42.420> they

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
security concerns safety concerns they

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.630 
security concerns safety concerns they
don't<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> real-time<00:00:43.980> properties<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
don't have the real-time properties that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
don't have the real-time properties that
are<00:00:44.789> required<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.539> becomes<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> problem

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
are required and that becomes a problem

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
are required and that becomes a problem
when<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.280> Linux<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.850> Android<00:00:47.910> systems<00:00:48.510> are

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
when these Linux and Android systems are

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
when these Linux and Android systems are
in<00:00:48.840> direct<00:00:48.989> interacting<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> other

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
in direct interacting with the other

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
in direct interacting with the other
vehicle<00:00:50.550> systems<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
vehicle systems and so we have a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.270 
vehicle systems and so we have a
solution<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.129> solution<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:55.160> what<00:00:56.160> we

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
solution for that solution and what we

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
solution for that solution and what we
do<00:00:56.399> technically<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
do technically is that we have a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
do technically is that we have a

them I can just show a small example

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.289 
them I can just show a small example
here<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.890> we've<00:01:26.009> built<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> small<00:01:26.610> application

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
here so we've built a small application

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.840 
here so we've built a small application
it's<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> navigation<00:01:28.110> system<00:01:31.250> each<00:01:32.250> unit<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it's a navigation system each unit this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's a navigation system each unit this
year<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> ride<00:01:33.420> might<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.020> represents

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
year on the ride might be see represents

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.590 
year on the ride might be see represents
the<00:01:34.560> rest<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> vehicle<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the rest of the vehicle and what you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
the rest of the vehicle and what you can
already<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.890> alcázar<00:01:38.369> is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
already see here is that the alcázar is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
already see here is that the alcázar is
sending<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.299> real-time<00:01:39.630> every<00:01:40.229> second

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
sending out in real-time every second

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
sending out in real-time every second
they<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.280> message<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> campus<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
they can message on the campus of the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
they can message on the campus of the
vehicles<00:01:42.780> I'm<00:01:42.960> doing<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> show<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> on

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
vehicles I'm doing it is to show that on

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
vehicles I'm doing it is to show that on
one<00:01:44.909> processor<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.659> autos<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.290> running

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
one processor we have autos are running

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.130 
one processor we have autos are running
independently<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.399> Android<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:48.990> we

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
independently from Android so here we

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.389 
independently from Android so here we
have<00:01:49.259> now<00:01:49.439> an<00:01:49.560> Android<00:01:49.890> app<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> has

battery to this navigation system here

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.929 
battery to this navigation system here
you<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> status<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> battery<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you see the status of the battery the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
you see the status of the battery the
position<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> car<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.049> green<00:02:07.289> circle

position of the car the green circle

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.979 
position of the car the green circle
shows<00:02:07.979> how<00:02:08.670> far<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.179> still<00:02:09.420> drive<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.840> my

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
shows how far I can still drive with my

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
shows how far I can still drive with my
battery<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.649> shows<00:02:11.120> communication

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
battery so it shows communication

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.990 
battery so it shows communication
between<00:02:12.239> Android<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.680> others<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
between Android and the others the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.580 
between Android and the others the
vehicle<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.480> example<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> battery<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
vehicle for example the battery and the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.800 
vehicle for example the battery and the
communication<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.280> safe<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:18.239> Android

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
communication is safe because Android

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.509 
communication is safe because Android
cannot<00:02:19.200> directly<00:02:19.470> interact<00:02:20.069> with<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> canvas

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
cannot directly interact with the canvas

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.380 
cannot directly interact with the canvas
all<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:23.370> kernel<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.819> looks<00:02:24.060> cannot

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
all of this the kernel in looks cannot

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.990 
all of this the kernel in looks cannot
see<00:02:24.660> directly<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.230> vehicles<00:02:25.980> nice<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
see directly the vehicles nice so you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.720 
see directly the vehicles nice so you
have<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.660> virtualize<00:02:28.319> Android<00:02:28.860> yes<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.580> have

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
have to virtualize Android yes we have

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.100 
have to virtualize Android yes we have
virtualized<00:02:30.180> Android<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.599> do<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.080> have

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
virtualized Android to do this you have

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.770 
virtualized Android to do this you have
to<00:02:31.349> do<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.510> our<00:02:33.660> approach

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
to do it like that that is our approach

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.080 
to do it like that that is our approach
and<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.349> think<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.580> very<00:02:35.760> sensible

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
and I think it's it's a very sensible

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.610 
and I think it's it's a very sensible
approach<00:02:36.390> because<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> makes<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.140> possible<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
approach because it makes it possible to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.050 
approach because it makes it possible to
integrate<00:02:37.920> Android<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:38.880> other

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
integrate Android with other

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.210 
integrate Android with other
applications<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:39.959> one<00:02:40.410> single<00:02:40.620> processor

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
applications on one single processor

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.589 
applications on one single processor
alright<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.549> IMX<00:02:45.150> under<00:02:45.450> that

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
alright and this is IMX under that

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.479 
alright and this is IMX under that
there's<00:02:46.079> an<00:02:46.230> ionic<00:02:46.620> simplicity<00:02:47.069> under<00:02:47.310> there

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
there's an ionic simplicity under there

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.430 
there's an ionic simplicity under there
I<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:48.090> demonstrate<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.660> although<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.380> a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
I can demonstrate that although it's a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.170 
I can demonstrate that although it's a
model<00:02:49.680> processor<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.730> nor<00:02:51.060> this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
model processor and nor this

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.819 
model processor and nor this
independence<00:02:51.750> from<00:02:51.870> all<00:02:52.079> tools<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.380> because

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
independence from all tools are because

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.589 
independence from all tools are because
if<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.549> here<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.180> send<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
if you go to the right here I can send a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.690 
if you go to the right here I can send a
message<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.959> my<00:02:55.260> canvas<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.370> shut<00:02:56.670> down

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
message to my canvas to just shut down

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.460 
message to my canvas to just shut down
Linux<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.329> restart<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.170> see<00:02:58.350> your

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
Linux and restart it so you see your

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.229 
Linux and restart it so you see your
every<00:02:58.739> second<00:02:59.100> also<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.489> running<00:02:59.819> I'm<00:02:59.970> going

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
every second also is running I'm going

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.140 
every second also is running I'm going
to<00:03:00.359> restart<00:03:00.890> Android<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.579> see<00:03:02.819> here<00:03:03.030> that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
to restart Android you see here that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
to restart Android you see here that
autos<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.600> keeps<00:03:03.840> running<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.230> real<00:03:04.410> time<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
autos are keeps running in real time and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.500 
autos are keeps running in real time and
if<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.459> move<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> left<00:03:05.910> here<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.299> will

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
if you move to the left here you will

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.030 
if you move to the left here you will
see<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.019> next<00:03:07.109> has<00:03:07.319> been<00:03:07.470> shut<00:03:07.650> down<00:03:07.709> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
see that the next has been shut down and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.699 
see that the next has been shut down and
is<00:03:08.220> restarting<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.239> I'm<00:03:09.329> really

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
is restarting so I'm really

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.660 
is restarting so I'm really
independently<00:03:10.709> running<00:03:10.980> Android<00:03:11.400> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
independently running Android and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
real-time stuff on one is this the first

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
first time that we have integrated autos

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900 
first time that we have integrated autos
are<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.049> endured<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> long<00:03:22.709> process<00:03:22.889> areas<00:03:23.280> all

Android<00:03:32.250> or<00:03:32.489> it's<00:03:32.910> more<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.660> some<00:03:33.870> types

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
Android or it's more like for some types

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.770 
Android or it's more like for some types
of<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:35.400> some<00:03:35.549> when<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.850> open<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.420> yeah

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
of you some when you open this one yeah

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.379 
of you some when you open this one yeah
and<00:03:37.109> this<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.650> for<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.730> verse<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.239> all

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
and this is it for this verse it's all

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.289 
and this is it for this verse it's all
done<00:03:39.569> in<00:03:39.660> software<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:41.340> we<00:03:41.639> also<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.180> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
done in software but we also have the

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.479 
done in software but we also have the
hardware<00:03:42.600> acceleration<00:03:43.230> working<00:03:44.100> already

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
hardware acceleration working already

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.830 
hardware acceleration working already
but<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.209> indicated<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.720> these

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
but it's not indicated in these

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.809 
but it's not indicated in these
demonstrations<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.400> far<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
demonstrations so far one of the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.640 
demonstrations so far one of the
trickier<00:03:48.150> parts<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.019> possible<00:03:49.410> then<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
trickier parts but it's possible then it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.470 
trickier parts but it's possible then it
works<00:03:49.889> it's<00:03:50.130> already<00:03:50.400> working<00:03:50.639> but<00:03:50.940> here<00:03:51.239> it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
works it's already working but here it's

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.970 
works it's already working but here it's
all<00:03:51.840> done<00:03:52.109> all<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.380> rendering<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.769> done<00:03:52.799> in

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
all done all the rendering is done in

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.770 
all done all the rendering is done in
software<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.700> how<00:03:53.819> soon<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.420> cars<00:03:54.599> gonna

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
software so how soon all the cars gonna

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.679 
software so how soon all the cars gonna
come<00:03:55.019> with<00:03:55.139> Android

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
come with Android

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.030 
come with Android
okay<00:03:57.689> we're<00:03:58.019> not<00:03:58.170> just<00:03:58.379> supporting<00:03:58.829> Android

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
okay we're not just supporting Android

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.520 
okay we're not just supporting Android
we're<00:03:59.249> supporting<00:03:59.489> Android<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.060> Linux<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.170> I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
we're supporting Android and Linux and I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.750 
we're supporting Android and Linux and I
think<00:04:01.739> there's<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:01.950> big<00:04:02.159> debate<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.670> the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
think there's a big debate in the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.729 
think there's a big debate in the
industry<00:04:03.209> will<00:04:03.599> will<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.139> industry<00:04:04.439> move<00:04:04.620> to

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
industry will will the industry move to

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.399 
industry will will the industry move to
Android<00:04:05.159> to<00:04:05.370> Linux<00:04:05.730> Jenny<00:04:06.030> V<00:04:06.239> or<00:04:06.569> other<00:04:06.900> closed

solutions<00:04:08.099> windows<00:04:08.909> for<00:04:09.090> example<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.689> think<00:04:10.290> in

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
solutions windows for example I think in

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.259 
solutions windows for example I think in
China<00:04:10.620> there<00:04:11.249> are<00:04:11.280> already<00:04:11.519> cars<00:04:11.879> on<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
China there are already cars on the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.030 
China there are already cars on the
streets<00:04:12.540> with<00:04:12.900> Android<00:04:13.290> bits<00:04:13.680> factory

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
streets with Android bits factory

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.229 
streets with Android bits factory
installed<00:04:14.280> Android<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.939> I<00:04:14.969> think<00:04:15.150> will

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
installed Android and I think will

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.580 
installed Android and I think will
continue<00:04:15.389> there<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:15.930> China<00:04:16.139> very<00:04:16.410> very

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
continue there in China very very

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.129 
continue there in China very very
quickly<00:04:16.829> in<00:04:17.130> Europe<00:04:18.090> we<00:04:18.389> will<00:04:18.539> see<00:04:18.720> Linux

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
quickly in Europe we will see Linux

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.319 
quickly in Europe we will see Linux
based<00:04:19.349> solutions<00:04:19.919> very<00:04:20.400> soon<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.209> next

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
based solutions very soon in the next

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.080 
based solutions very soon in the next
years<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.780> come<00:04:22.019> Android<00:04:22.860> I'm<00:04:23.039> not<00:04:23.220> sure<00:04:23.400> it

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
years to come Android I'm not sure it

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.730 
years to come Android I'm not sure it
takes<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.389> little<00:04:24.509> time<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:25.169> get<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.500> whole

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
takes a little time to get the whole

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.120 
takes a little time to get the whole
thing<00:04:25.889> done

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
thing done

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.180 
thing done
let<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.940> whole<00:04:27.060> thing<00:04:27.090> certify<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.900> word<00:04:28.190> yes

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
let the whole thing certify the word yes

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.430 
let the whole thing certify the word yes
I<00:04:29.400> think<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:30.389> automotive<00:04:30.840> industries<00:04:31.259> is

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
I think the automotive industries is

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.529 
I think the automotive industries is
very<00:04:31.680> quality<00:04:31.949> aware<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.910> they've

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
very quality aware and they've

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.420 
very quality aware and they've
relatively<00:04:34.080> long<00:04:34.229> development<00:04:34.470> processes<00:04:35.099> if

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
relatively long development processes if

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.339 
relatively long development processes if
somebody<00:04:35.820> decides<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.389> OAM<00:04:36.780> we<00:04:36.990> want<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.259> have

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
somebody decides in OAM we want to have

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.290 
somebody decides in OAM we want to have
Android<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:38.039> will<00:04:38.370> be<00:04:38.520> in<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.759> car<00:04:39.000> three

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
Android it will be in the car three

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.129 
Android it will be in the car three
years<00:04:39.449> later<00:04:39.720> maybe

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
years later maybe

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.990 
years later maybe
according<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.009> European<00:04:41.099> United<00:04:41.610> States

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
according to the European United States

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.339 
according to the European United States
standards<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:42.720> we<00:04:42.750> can<00:04:43.020> find<00:04:43.229> more
