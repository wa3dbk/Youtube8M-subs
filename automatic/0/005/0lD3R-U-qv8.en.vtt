00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.970
 well this here is a sample of what 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.670
 are the files that we are going to download 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:14.379
 to have all day in riding camber 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.170
 of X and obviously will tend to Jason 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.230
 Bourne to select and use it to play 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.460
 with him also the three boxes for 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.380
 the three characters that will come out 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 in a while then 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.780
 the procedure is this 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.899
 what am I putting on the screen 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.060
 they have to install the game they do not use 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.580
 crack 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.610
 and then install the file that is called 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.580
 day 1 and then create the game then 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.340
 with that with that crack is in there 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.400
 then then we put all the dlc 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.670
 as we see here that I have 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.570
 deadly blue kombat steve to succeed 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.390
 board charters 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.820
 the costumes that I was here 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.300
 etcetera there is then already owed 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.340
 be that they are up to date what they have left and 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.840
 then then we proceed to install the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.230
 files that I told them 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.370
 the book bay 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.850
 max or 201 I then named it as one 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.300
 as well 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 then the fingers then the world interest 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.590
 I remember them 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.940
 as the final note says every out day 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.220
 has at the end 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.740
 a clichÃ© selection where you have 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.400
 what to select the bad point 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.590
 to finish the patch the loop of yes no 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.290
 they do it if it does not work for you if you do not 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.330
 they do as I'm explaining it is not going 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.930
 to work and the new characters do not 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.960
 they will be 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.550
 the update will not do any good 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.180
 follow the steps I have given you and you will see 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.790
 Below I show you these 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.420
 are the dlc and then there are the d 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.069
 here they are 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.470
 there are the first ones we installed this 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.570
 then we install 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.070
 in the order that I am proposing 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.780
 here in blow I hope it is clear and 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.140
 that works for them because it did not work 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.860
 to the wonders 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.870
 Now I show you again Jason 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.099
 edges in action 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.099
 I will leave it in plain sight 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.220
 what I achieved and I would like 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.450
 also others and who subscribe to me 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.750
 obviously channel 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.849
 look there is still where we are from 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.120
 fighting 2 now I'm going to select 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:54.840
 jason so you can see it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.840
 we enter here we enter towers and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.720
 then conditional 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.720
 let's see what we have 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.350
 As you can see there is the list of 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.350
 personal that I have in my pc 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 and in this corner 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.879
 We have Mr. James Jones 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.780
 if they do the procedure as I do them 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:24.730
 I say it is 100% reliable it will look good 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.730
 and they're going to have all the characters 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.700
 there are details 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.379
 and there it is 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.379
 and there we are going to play a little 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.100
 I am not very skilled in movements 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.440
 of the engine like but in the end to see 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.040
 that we can teach to see that 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 this is full 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.790
 there comes Jason 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.650
 that is to say 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.650
 all right 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.459
 but 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.459
 and 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:25.670
 do not 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.670
 let's see the movements of details 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.380
 d 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.610
 and there it is as we could see is 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.900
 working works very well if they do 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.720
 the procedure and download the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.760
 files that I tell you can use it to 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.760
 the wonders that has been everything
