00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
little preview of the next fighter of

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.740 
little preview of the next fighter of
the<00:03:13.609> word<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.730> first<00:03:14.940> fight<00:03:15.209> all<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.389> special

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
the word the first fight all the special

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.210 
the word the first fight all the special
circuit<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.139> I<00:03:16.200> can't<00:03:16.440> beat<00:03:16.620> that's<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
circuit that I can't beat that's the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.690 
circuit that I can't beat that's the
furthest<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.639> can<00:03:17.819> get<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.120> first<00:03:18.359> guy<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:19.530> um

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
furthest I can get the first guy but um

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.590 
furthest I can get the first guy but um
probably<00:03:20.700> one<00:03:20.790> thing<00:03:20.910> why<00:03:21.000> would<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.269> an<00:03:21.450> LP

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
probably one thing why would I do an LP

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.780 
probably one thing why would I do an LP
that<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.959> can't<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.350> well<00:03:22.500> technically<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.190> did

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
that I can't be well technically I did

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.870 
that I can't be well technically I did
beat<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> game<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:25.760> unlocking<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
beat the game because unlocking the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.809 
beat the game because unlocking the
special<00:03:27.329> circuit<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.739> actually<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> bonus<00:03:29.519> to

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
special circuit is actually a bonus to

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.020 
special circuit is actually a bonus to
the<00:03:29.970> game<00:03:30.470> whereas<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.799> actual<00:03:32.130> game<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.760> just

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
the game whereas the actual game is just

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.750 
the game whereas the actual game is just
beating<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.690> first<00:03:34.049> three<00:03:34.230> circuits<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.920> know

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
beating the first three circuits I know

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.909
