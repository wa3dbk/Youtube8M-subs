moment let me show you how we prepared
things<00:00:12.210> under<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.660> first<00:00:13.469> off<00:00:13.710> you'll

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
things under here first off you'll

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.709 
things under here first off you'll
notice<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.519> black<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.120> been<00:00:15.299> stone

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
notice this is black it's been stone

shipped<00:00:16.139> over<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> paint<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> will<00:00:18.000> show

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
shipped over the paint so I will show

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300 
shipped over the paint so I will show
you<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.990> later<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> bonnet

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you how to do that later with the bonnet

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.759 
you how to do that later with the bonnet
in<00:00:20.490> another<00:00:20.699> program<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.900> actual<00:00:22.050> fixings

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
in another program the actual fixings

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
in another program the actual fixings
for<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.550> suspension<00:00:24.150> cage<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.960> here

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
for the suspension cage are here

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.970 
for the suspension cage are here
therefore<00:00:26.090> vblocks<00:00:27.090> rubber<00:00:27.480> blocks<00:00:27.859> two<00:00:28.859> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
therefore vblocks rubber blocks two of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.189 
therefore vblocks rubber blocks two of
them<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.220> already<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> car<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.960> side

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
them are already on the car on this side

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
them are already on the car on this side
one<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> other<00:00:31.710> side<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
one the other side so it's here on the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.200 
one the other side so it's here on the
other<00:00:33.570> side<00:00:33.950> front<00:00:34.950> end<00:00:35.219> both<00:00:35.610> sides<00:00:35.969> we've

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
other side front end both sides we've

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.370 
other side front end both sides we've
left<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.540> off<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.079> they're<00:00:37.230> actually

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
left them off here but they're actually

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
left them off here but they're actually
on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> suspension<00:00:38.100> case<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
on the suspension case because it is a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
on the suspension case because it is a
tricky<00:00:39.510> job<00:00:39.540> trying<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> manhandle<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.190> in

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
tricky job trying to manhandle this in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.000 
tricky job trying to manhandle this in
you'll<00:00:41.550> also<00:00:41.670> notice<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:43.140> we've<00:00:43.770> got<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you'll also notice up here we've got a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.270 
you'll also notice up here we've got a
fuel<00:00:44.370> pipe<00:00:44.670> which<00:00:45.510> has<00:00:45.840> been<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.920> first

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
fuel pipe which has been put in first

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010 
fuel pipe which has been put in first
because<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.149> difficult<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
because it's very difficult to get to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
because it's very difficult to get to
this<00:00:49.170> once<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> cage<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.460> place<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:52.610> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this once the cage is in place now it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
this once the cage is in place now it's
a<00:00:54.059> tricky<00:00:54.420> job<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.840> said<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> need

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.730 

a<00:02:18.550> superb<00:02:19.550> job<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.420> went<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.960> easier<00:02:21.560> than

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
a superb job that went in easier than

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.560 
a superb job that went in easier than
any<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.130> us<00:02:22.250> thought<00:02:22.550> possible<00:02:23.180> but<00:02:23.390> it's<00:02:23.510> not

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
any of us thought possible but it's not

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.000 
any of us thought possible but it's not
finished<00:02:23.900> yet<00:02:24.080> there's<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.410> lot<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.620> fiddling

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
finished yet there's a lot of fiddling

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.530 
finished yet there's a lot of fiddling
to<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.430> get<00:02:25.520> all<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.910> rest<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.270> bolts

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.000 
to do to get all the rest of the bolts
in<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.870> we're<00:02:27.020> going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.170> crack<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.680> that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
in so we're going to crack on with that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.950 
in so we're going to crack on with that
when<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.550> gets<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.850> bit<00:02:28.970> tricky<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.540> always

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
when it gets a bit tricky you always

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.750 
when it gets a bit tricky you always
