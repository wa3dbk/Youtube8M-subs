so not much to do like playing with

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
so not much to do like playing with

if<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> know<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.420> mean<00:01:18.680> new<00:01:19.680> Deeks<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> an

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
if you know what I mean new Deeks is an

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
if you know what I mean new Deeks is an
example<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.450> new<00:01:21.630> defensive<00:01:22.229> plays<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
example a new defensive plays that can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.399 
example a new defensive plays that can
make<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.670> pro<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:25.080> stats

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
make that would make your pro like stats

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.420 
make that would make your pro like stats
and<00:01:25.590> stuff<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.280> much

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and stuff like that just that much

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.899 
and stuff like that just that much
different<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.140> overall<00:01:28.140> make<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> better<00:01:28.909> but

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
different and overall make it better but

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.310 
different and overall make it better but
I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:33.329> probably<00:01:33.630> help<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I think that would probably help out a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840 
I think that would probably help out a
little<00:01:34.740> bit<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
little bit I don't think it's going to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
little bit I don't think it's going to
help<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> another<00:01:36.750> thing<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> think

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
help out a lot but another thing I think

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
help out a lot but another thing I think
they<00:01:37.320> should<00:01:37.500> do<00:01:37.700> please<00:01:38.700> make<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
they should do please make it so you

they should do please make it so you
start<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> low<00:01:40.079> rink<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.829> add<00:01:41.070> that

of<00:02:19.800> cheesy<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.310> I'm<00:02:20.400> saying<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:20.880> I'm<00:02:21.510> just

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
of cheesy what I'm saying but I'm just

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.000 
of cheesy what I'm saying but I'm just
trying<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.560> should<00:02:22.590> had<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> lot

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
trying just think they should had a lot

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.530 
trying just think they should had a lot
more<00:02:23.040> customization<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
more customization and then for the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.940 
more customization and then for the
jerseys<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.080> spill<00:02:25.319> make<00:02:25.530> them<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.740> lot<00:02:25.920> more

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
jerseys you spill make them a lot more

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.730 
jerseys you spill make them a lot more
cooler<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.790> lot<00:02:27.180> more<00:02:27.330> unique<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.050> stuff<00:02:28.590> like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
cooler a lot more unique and stuff like

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.600 
cooler a lot more unique and stuff like
that<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:31.130> stats<00:02:32.130> should<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.580> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
that I think that stats should be a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.979 
that I think that stats should be a
little<00:02:32.819> bit<00:02:33.000> different<00:02:33.300> next<00:02:33.420> year<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.900> to

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
little bit different next year just to

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.300 
little bit different next year just to
change<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.380> up<00:02:34.470> i<00:02:34.590> mean<00:02:34.709> i<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> stats

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
change it up i mean i like the stats

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.440 
change it up i mean i like the stats
this<00:02:35.459> year<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:35.790> i<00:02:35.850> think<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.090> should<00:02:36.270> just

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
this year but i think they should just

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.449 
this year but i think they should just
change<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.989> up<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.230> little<00:02:37.260> bit<00:02:37.440> make<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.010> fresh

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
change it up a little bit make it fresh

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.670 
change it up a little bit make it fresh
unique<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.239> know<00:02:39.360> different<00:02:39.630> inside<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
unique you know different inside the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
unique you know different inside the
same<00:02:40.860> thing<00:02:41.010> every<00:02:41.220> year<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:42.450> they<00:02:42.569> need

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
same thing every year I think they need

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.130 
same thing every year I think they need
to<00:02:42.780> do<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:44.489> top<00:02:44.730> two<00:02:45.000> teams<00:02:45.270> play<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
to do a the top two teams play in a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.190 
to do a the top two teams play in a
winter<00:02:46.320> classic<00:02:46.860> match<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.660> EA<00:02:48.660> sports<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
winter classic match and EA sports a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.810 
winter classic match and EA sports a
live<00:02:49.350> streams<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.010> their<00:02:50.160> website<00:02:50.280> unlike

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
live streams it on their website unlike

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.520 
live streams it on their website unlike
that<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.209> think<00:02:51.690> that'd<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.900> pretty<00:02:52.050> cool<00:02:52.170> it's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
that I think that'd be pretty cool it's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.229 
that I think that'd be pretty cool it's
like<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.739> best<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> three<00:02:53.100> or<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.820> 20

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
like a best of three or it's like a 20

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.120 
like a best of three or it's like a 20
minute<00:02:54.480> period<00:02:54.870> thing<00:02:55.050> like<00:02:55.500> them<00:02:55.680> periods

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
minute period thing like them periods

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.100 
minute period thing like them periods
are<00:02:56.220> actually<00:02:56.459> 20<00:02:56.730> minutes<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.209> think<00:02:58.050> that

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
are actually 20 minutes I think that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.110 
are actually 20 minutes I think that
would<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.380> pretty<00:02:58.500> cool<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.400> top<00:02:59.640> two<00:02:59.880> teams

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
would be pretty cool the top two teams

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.330 
would be pretty cool the top two teams
every<00:03:00.510> month<00:03:00.720> battle<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> winter<00:03:01.709> classic

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
every month battle in the winter classic

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.210 
every month battle in the winter classic
and<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.300> winning<00:03:03.480> team<00:03:03.840> they<00:03:04.709> got<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> trophy

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and the winning team they got a trophy

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.800 
and the winning team they got a trophy
as<00:03:05.580> well<00:03:05.819> as<00:03:06.080> either<00:03:07.580> hot<00:03:08.580> packs<00:03:08.910> or<00:03:09.330> something

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
as well as either hot packs or something

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.059 
as well as either hot packs or something
else<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.319> add<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> little<00:03:10.560> bit<00:03:10.769> son<00:03:10.950> like

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
else just to add a little bit son like

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.740 
else just to add a little bit son like
that<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.430> make<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> little<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:12.030> cool<00:03:12.480> I

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that just make a little more cool I

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.509 
that just make a little more cool I
think<00:03:13.530> there's<00:03:13.709> got<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> be<00:03:13.950> more<00:03:14.040> tourneys

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
think there's got to be more tourneys

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.220 
think there's got to be more tourneys
and<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.150> think<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> torrents<00:03:15.780> got<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.959> be<00:03:16.019> best

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and I think the torrents got to be best

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.319 
and I think the torrents got to be best
of<00:03:16.350> three<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.769> get<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.040> playoffs<00:03:17.370> best

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
of three when you get the playoffs best

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.610 
of three when you get the playoffs best
of<00:03:18.420> three<00:03:18.480> our<00:03:18.720> best<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.049> five<00:03:19.230> or<00:03:19.590> even

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
of three our best of five or even

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.199 
of three our best of five or even
best-of-seven<00:03:20.160> by<00:03:20.489> think<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.820> way<00:03:20.940> too<00:03:20.970> many

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
best-of-seven by think it's way too many

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.800 
best-of-seven by think it's way too many
um<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.730> next<00:03:24.030> thing<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.360> think<00:03:24.540> they<00:03:24.630> should

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
um the next thing I think they should

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.460 
um the next thing I think they should
add<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:27.299> hard<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.570> explain<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.230> there

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
add is it's hard to explain but there

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.160 
add is it's hard to explain but there
should<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:29.420> there's<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.570> more<00:03:30.600> things<00:03:31.019> you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
should be a there's be more things you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.590 
should be a there's be more things you
could<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.440> four<00:03:31.739> esh<00:03:32.160> all<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.430> mean<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.540> only

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
could do four esh all I mean the only

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.319 
could do four esh all I mean the only
thing<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.200> drop<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.180> play<00:03:36.180> on

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
thing you can do is drop in and play on

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.660 
thing you can do is drop in and play on
your<00:03:36.360> team<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:38.040> she'll<00:03:38.280> do<00:03:38.459> more<00:03:38.640> I

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
your team I I think she'll do more I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.979 
your team I I think she'll do more I
think<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.060> should<00:03:39.180> be<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> bigger<00:03:39.570> and

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
think there should be a bigger and

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.330 
think there should be a bigger and
better<00:03:40.140> practicing<00:03:40.950> where<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.220> could

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
better practicing where you could

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.220 
better practicing where you could
practice<00:03:41.730> drills<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.480> are<00:03:42.540> preset<00:03:43.109> up

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
practice drills that are preset up

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.470 
practice drills that are preset up
there's<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.250> cones<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.880> stuff<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> way

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
there's like cones and stuff in the way

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.090 
there's like cones and stuff in the way
that<00:03:45.690> help<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.200> practice<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.829> stuff<00:03:46.980> like

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
that help you practice and stuff like

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.390 
that help you practice and stuff like
that<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:48.299> make<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.780> lot<00:03:49.019> better<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:50.340> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
that and just make it a lot better but I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.039 
that and just make it a lot better but I
think<00:03:50.640> gameplay<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.450> biggest<00:03:51.750> thing<00:03:51.900> they

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
think gameplay is the biggest thing they

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.569 
think gameplay is the biggest thing they
have<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.230> improve<00:03:52.680> on<00:03:52.859> making<00:03:53.220> new<00:03:53.310> Deeks

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
have to improve on making new Deeks

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.160 
have to improve on making new Deeks
making<00:03:53.970> better<00:03:54.269> defensive<00:03:54.810> plays<00:03:54.989> just

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
making better defensive plays just

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.830 
making better defensive plays just
making<00:03:55.470> your<00:03:55.620> pro<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.640> guy<00:03:56.880> bill<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.660> that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
making your pro the one guy bill do that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.690 
making your pro the one guy bill do that
much<00:03:58.019> more<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.980> much<00:03:59.160> different<00:03:59.640> just

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
much more and that much different just

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.759

don't<00:05:13.710> know<00:05:13.770> how<00:05:13.919> but<00:05:14.129> it<00:05:14.460> doesn't<00:05:14.759> matter

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
don't know how but it doesn't matter
