 for Christmas presents displayed so 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.140
 For example, I give gifts for the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.160
 I just want to go here 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.230
 and you can look at ideas and here 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.480
 we will then directly gift ideas 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.209
 displayed here for example a pillow 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.370
 and when I type up then I have 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.690
 the option to see the price 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.720
 Here is a short description 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.019
 can remember the whole thing then it can only 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.760

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.349
 can also click directly on the shop 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.810
 then I will be very nice in the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.190
 app and not on the browser on the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.290
 respective website provider 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.300
 forwarded and can in this case 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.110
 for example, the pillow at the provider 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.959
 to buy 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.930
 The magazine offers me still say 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.069
 other options, for example, not ten 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.319
 christmas for women on 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.060
 read on I go here too 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.129
 again nice ideas displayed what you 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.720
 for example, could give away 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.849
 so really nice too 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.920
 get inspiration if you yourself 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.300
 Let me tell you something or ask 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.519
 just look for more ideas 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.730
 So if we really want one 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.140
 different occasions really nice 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.159
 proposals have given us and the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.019
 Themes two more points 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.760
 shared experiences are for example 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.620
 their gifts live indirectly themselves 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.379
 also benefits with that is about 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.489
 movie visit at home also very much 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.720
 beautiful things will be partly 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.940
 you did not suggest the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.220
 But just buy here 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.810
 classic movies evening and then 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.280
 I never had the incredibly practical 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.870
 option video stores nearby 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.489
 must display for that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.310
 location function of course activated 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.659
 and can be so for example 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.790
 libraries or restaurants if to 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.150
 food is close to show directly 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.849
 to let 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.500
 personal gifts as a last point 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.060
 the topics yes as the name already reveals 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.860
 here are simply hiding personal 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.720
 Gifts also because the most diverse 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.489
 Categories where I rest 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.140
 can work through, for example, a 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.150
 cooking class almost I think of many 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.980
 Good at pinching you can also directly here 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.330
 View nearby colleges 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.220
 All that is really very good 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.360
 still have links at the bottom 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.040

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.520
 the tracking on and off and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.180
 can say if I want to be reminded 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.340
 or not 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.410
 all in all , not from luca 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.180

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.190

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.680

 Nowadays the offer is growing 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.080
 under increasing rock a partially 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.160
 really hard sometimes to 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.380
 to keep an overview 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.270
 straight through the filter function one has 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.130
 Here is really the option that I like 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.570
 matching gifts will be displayed 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.830

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.570
 a gift or maybe it is 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.700
 you can forget something about yourself 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.470
 Your reminder combined with 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.570

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.760
