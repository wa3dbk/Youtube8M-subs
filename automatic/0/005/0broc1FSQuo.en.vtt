00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.719
 celebrating the launch of the noas t-shirt visit is not important 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.650
 emphasize the tri as always has 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.350
 has two equipments the one of local the one of visit in this occasion finally 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.309
 after much expectation efe 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.309
 we knew in adidas that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.970
 dt visit or by obama then we reveal it with pleasure now and it's 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 this famous black yersey 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.770
 percent and I'm sure to come back 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.399
 practically a classic 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.060
 we did not want to distract 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.010
 to the people komon if the color that anv and that is if it is green blue this red 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.710
 is and not to concentrate more on the story in this we are counting on inspiration 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.800
 of a warrior Count Roa and that of the values ​​behind him 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.920
 in the Mexican national team 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.480
 I want to worry about the injuries for which we split the two releases not 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.470
 let the truth live is that 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.900
 the local uniform on the green background this is me has a lot of history has 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.040
 a lot of weight and we need to give them importance 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.059
 that decision how are they taken or 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.760
 combined that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.070
 The first thing we do is 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.409
 well an entire analysis 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.440
 behind the selection data of the federation 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.220
 and the one that has to do with the values 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 that people give the selection what they want to see in terms of a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.510
 uniform that does not mean exactly the color noticed because if I want 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.070
 a uniform that is more modern that is more risky or we like 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.460
 uniform that is more elegant that is more sober 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.659
 I promise that we go with many parts of 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.780
 Of each country 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 we see what are the characteristics of previous reports that we liked 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.750
 we make a historical analysis of the failures that have had 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.740
 We knew that there existed pretty efe we ​​know that there exists in red the one that has been 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.170
 been like a request out there and what 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.790
 I was very curious but for some time create uniforms red and 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.119
 this time we take it for 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.650
 the goalkeeper uniform 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.360
 by the way the second uniform goalkeeper that actually by the way is a subject 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.770
 perhaps the one that we will have to enter in more detail because the goalkeepers 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.730
 end of the day could choose what temporary 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.640
 the idea 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.979
 is that they achieve the highest survey or at least technically in terms of 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.100
 equipment have at your disposal the latest we have done as a brand 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.550
 so that she sports performance percent is put on the back burner and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.800
 after a physical and tactical preparation is eternal but in terms of equipment 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.159
 there is no limitation 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.839
 as one of the five most important federations for adidas in the world 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.179
 you put these provisions because that is also something important d of 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:27.109
 to emphasize perhaps is that these technologies that we are seeing from 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:27.869
 front 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.019
 detectives please and d 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.119
 informed uson 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.429
 are for the five pto selections 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.079
 ounce to those of kill we have more elections in total we have 12 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.389
 selections within the world 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.619
 but not all have a design as specific as that of Mexico or that of 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.689
 German and Spanish from France where we analyze all history 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.809
 clearly rtve we recover that decade of each selection 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.189
 but with these five selections or six elections it's a lot more work 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.339
 punctual of two key inspirational shipments 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:59.029
 how is the chest of the eagle warrior with these with these this 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.650
 for example with this alien poem 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.100
 then those deaths very important there is also no technology then 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.050
 clearly we tested it first with our main selections and it's the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.069
 case of mexico 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.169
 and well at the end that way you get that talk a lot with doing with 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.889
 lacerations and canasa is not an adidas decision that is very 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:16.980
 important to know 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.680
 it's a team work they go hand in hand the access to the players to the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.700
 concentrations 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.330
 is through the federation then together we make the proposals that 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.759
 We take your comments and we get to a color 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.519
 with fine uniform 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.519
 but rumors that will present it against new zealand 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.700
 in the game in March because I do not know landa the the name of the team are the colo'o to 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:40.090
 ips 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.349
 do not take out you speak white 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.079
 and we will have dark khaled and it would be with the black report that would be 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.419
 the first time the meridanos on the court 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.099
 and the second question is where do or did not touch it and when lopo in 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.830
 against the consumer 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.899
 and refering to 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:55.869
 efe 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.899
 where in the entire commercial network 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.819
 percent as of February 12 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.640
 we were missing more week consumption 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.509
 will be ready for sale 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.029
 in prices 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.599
 are very similar to those of locals are in fact the same as we have that are 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.699
 driving as a local then there is no 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.509
 there is not a difference because they are color of this one again no this is the same 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.509
 equipment coughs keep the same prices there is no difference between 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.890
 climate reported are but has to see by technology 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.550
 clearly 1 upi liza materials 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.759
 completely different from the other then that's what makes the differences 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.149
 but it takes campaign that speaks of that all this equipment is not condix with history 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.989
 just also every team that had to change this and this is that 

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:40.779
 this cessation is that that shirt I do not believe that 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.009
 all this being handled as a team because there is not much 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.390
 discrepancy between federation us to really is that your mother is one 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.520
 work unit 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.150
 then you are very happy and the players who have seen it already want it 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.620
 use on the court because yes if you see 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.229
 if you see a major change there and in the general response we have 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.960
 obtained very elegant psc-psoe 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.510
 in the network the complete team is the black totes the onerous shocks that 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.089
 accepted then we go completely in uniform 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.939
 sober 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.110
 black 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.430
 hey that the subject to see very very very well 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.910
 efe once you are on the court
