00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone with you again max and channel 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.540
 beardcam today we are preparing a mask for 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.779
 beard which will stimulate growth 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.779
 hair 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 the recipe of this mask is based mustard 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.719
 powders for the mask we need 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.100
 mustard powder my case it 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.190
 coarse powder it is for 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.010
 Dijon mustard a little bit of sugar butter 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.489
 jojoba burdock oil boiling water 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.620
 1 egg yolk in which capacity we will 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.210
 to mix 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 The principle of operation of this mask is built on 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.010
 skin irritation and stimulation 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.100
 blood circulation to improve nutrition 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 the hair bulbs will start the process 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.250
 cooking take 3 teaspoons 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.250
 mustard powder 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.980
 now take 4 teaspoons of boiling water 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.370
 we mix the boiling water thoroughly we put in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.610
 the first place to run 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:32.280
 or activate mustard to all 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.700
 pungent mustard properties activated in 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700
 the first place 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.940
 mix the substance thoroughly 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.119
 following the mustard we will add 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.119
 a teaspoon without a slide of sugar 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:10.700
 sugar is needed to enhance the mustard bitterness 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:12.890
 And burning also mix until the mass 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.280
 hot sugar dissolves enough 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 quickly 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.940
 then add one egg yolk 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:36.540
 egg yolk will moisturize and nourish 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.540
 mix skin thoroughly 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.609
 after we stirred the yolk 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.609
 add 2 teaspoons of burdock oil 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.989
 instead of burdock oil you can take 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.299
 any other vegetable oil i 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.620
 take burdock 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:07.409
 because it has properties 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.409
 reduces hair loss and improves them 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:18.419
 growth also i will add two teaspoons 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:25.109
 jojoba oil she is wonderful nourishes 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:28.760
 hair and skin and will render small 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:32.760
 protective effect so like this mask 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.930
 quite intensively and negatively affected 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.730
 on the skin that is, it irritates her and 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.669
 dry your hair and 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.799
 in order to reduce destructive spectacularly 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:48.120
 hair we add nourishing oils 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.500
 in order to protect their primary 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.019
 our task is 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.909
 irritate the skin of the face in order to 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.669
 stimulate blood circulation but at the same time 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.669
 we want to preserve the integrity of the hair 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.950
 mix everything thoroughly until smooth 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.950
 masses 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.880
 all mask is ready for use given 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.479
 mask applied preferably only on the skin 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.389
 bypassing the hair itself can be used as 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.960
 to enhance hair growth on the head so and 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.020
 on the face 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.300
 in our case this is a beard 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.639
 if you have a long enough beard 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.060
 longer than 1 centimeter is desirable 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.100
 use before the mask 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.930
 before you apply the mask 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.620
 apply any moisturizing oil on 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.350
 the hair itself 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.960
 in order to protect them and directly on 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.270
 skin with a brush to apply this 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.240
 mask the words themselves are almost the same 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.250
 If your beard length from five to 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.550
 ten millimeters, in principle, you can 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:08.220
 don't wet your beard hair next 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.199
 video i will show how to use this 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:17.009
 mask if you use this mask 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:19.770
 first time that recommended time 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:23.130
 this mask should be on the face 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.030
 it's not more than 15 minutes with time you 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.419
 can increase the term which will be 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.639
 be this mask on your face 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.000
 rinse it off with warm water after 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.630
 you struck it is desirable to roll your face 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.800
 cling film or you just pack and 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.310
 as in the case of 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.139
 mask with burdock mask too 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.250
 use a towel to 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.520
 create a sauna effect 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.289
