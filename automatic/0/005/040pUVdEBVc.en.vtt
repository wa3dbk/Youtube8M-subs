00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
about that listen if the trade-off is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.749 
about that listen if the trade-off is
half<00:01:29.959> theater<00:01:30.289> with<00:01:30.439> more<00:01:30.679> lag<00:01:31.249> and<00:01:31.429> worst<00:01:31.609> hit

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779 
the perk system the person perk system

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:02.019 
the perk system the person perk system
in<00:01:59.899> this<00:02:00.139> game<00:02:00.349> is<00:02:00.529> excellent<00:02:01.189> it's<00:02:01.639> basically

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.029 
in this game is excellent it's basically

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.149 
in this game is excellent it's basically
a<00:02:02.119> pic<00:02:02.419> 30<00:02:02.719> system<00:02:03.139> kind<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.469> an<00:02:03.560> extension<00:02:03.799> of

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
a pic 30 system kind of an extension of

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.739 
a pic 30 system kind of an extension of
the<00:02:04.310> pic<00:02:04.489> 10<00:02:04.700> system<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.209> was<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.419> black<00:02:05.539> ops

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
the pic 10 system that was in black ops

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.809 
the pic 10 system that was in black ops
2<00:02:05.869> but<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.679> is<00:02:06.829> awesome<00:02:07.279> I<00:02:07.369> think<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.639> balance

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
2 but it is awesome I think the balance

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.940 
2 but it is awesome I think the balance
is<00:02:08.179> great<00:02:08.599> I<00:02:08.869> think<00:02:09.410> other<00:02:09.560> than<00:02:09.619> maybe

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
is great I think other than maybe

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.040 
is great I think other than maybe
amplify<00:02:10.550> should<00:02:10.819> probably<00:02:11.120> be<00:02:11.209> three<00:02:11.569> points

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
amplify should probably be three points

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.570 
amplify should probably be three points
I<00:02:12.200> would<00:02:12.290> say<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> balance<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.099> really<00:02:13.280> good

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I would say the balance is really good

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.670 
I would say the balance is really good
in<00:02:13.790> cog<00:02:14.150> could<00:02:14.690> probably<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:15.140> two<00:02:15.290> points<00:02:15.620> a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
in cog could probably be two points a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.770 
in cog could probably be two points a
little<00:02:15.920> changes<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.460> but<00:02:17.150> overall<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
little changes like that but overall the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.760 
little changes like that but overall the
perk<00:02:18.020> balance<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.560> great<00:02:18.920> i<00:02:19.100> love

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
perk balance is great i love

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.440 
perk balance is great i love
they<00:02:19.890> split<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> perks<00:02:21.060> made

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
they split up some of the perks made

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.510 
they split up some of the perks made
some<00:02:21.780> perks<00:02:22.110> cost<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.620> lot<00:02:22.770> more<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.250> dead<00:02:23.490> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
some perks cost a lot more like dead I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.460 
some perks cost a lot more like dead I
others<00:02:24.210> cost<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.630> lot<00:02:24.720> less<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
others cost a lot less I think the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.800 
others cost a lot less I think the
balance<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:26.100> nearly<00:02:26.610> perfect<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.630> well

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
balance is nearly perfect it's so well

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.110 
balance is nearly perfect it's so well
done<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.590> possibilities<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.430> endless<00:02:29.610> I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
done the possibilities are endless I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.180 
done the possibilities are endless I
struggle<00:02:30.660> all<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.840> time<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.380> trying<00:02:32.130> to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
struggle all the time in trying to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
struggle all the time in trying to
design<00:02:32.520> my<00:02:32.760> perk<00:02:33.030> system<00:02:33.450> which<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.840> think

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
design my perk system which I think

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.270 
design my perk system which I think
that's<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.350> whole<00:02:34.500> point<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:34.890> that's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
that's the whole point I think that's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.450 
that's the whole point I think that's
really<00:02:35.670> good<00:02:35.820> balance<00:02:37.100> overall<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.160> think<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
really good balance overall I think the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.340 
really good balance overall I think the
perk<00:02:38.700> system<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.240> as<00:02:39.360> good<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.140> not<00:02:40.170> better

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
perk system is as good if not better

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.020 
perk system is as good if not better
than<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:40.980> ever<00:02:41.100> been<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.790> game's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
than it's ever been in this game's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.760 
than it's ever been in this game's
history<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.600> think<00:02:42.750> it's<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.080> big<00:02:43.320> step<00:02:43.500> forward

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
history I think it's a big step forward

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.980 
history I think it's a big step forward
I<00:02:43.920> love<00:02:44.220> how<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:45.240> tailor<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.720> your<00:02:45.840> own

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
just awesome a plus for the perk system

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.820 
just awesome a plus for the perk system
next<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.270> game<00:02:51.690> mode<00:02:51.960> crank<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.650> think

next up this game mode crank I think

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.580 
next up this game mode crank I think
crank<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:54.000> best<00:02:54.390> game<00:02:54.630> mode<00:02:54.840> addition<00:02:55.350> to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
crank is the best game mode addition to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
crank is the best game mode addition to
