a<00:00:12.549> couple<00:00:12.759> years<00:00:12.940> ago<00:00:13.089> so<00:00:13.299> check<00:00:13.719> that<00:00:13.929> one<00:00:14.079> out

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
a couple years ago so check that one out

guess a common ix rollout IX left a long
time<00:00:19.960> ago<00:00:20.349> for<00:00:20.560> me<00:00:20.710> which<00:00:20.890> said<00:00:21.070> hey<00:00:21.250> Chris<00:00:21.460> you

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
time ago for me which said hey Chris you

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.130 
time ago for me which said hey Chris you
should<00:00:21.640> use<00:00:21.939> some<00:00:22.119> smaller<00:00:22.420> joints<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:22.990> try

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
should use some smaller joints and try

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.439 
should use some smaller joints and try
making<00:00:23.289> smaller<00:00:23.830> transformers<00:00:24.550> so<00:00:25.089> this<00:00:25.300> is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
making smaller transformers so this is

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.499 
making smaller transformers so this is
not<00:00:26.080> quite<00:00:26.410> his<00:00:26.710> scale<00:00:27.070> but<00:00:27.640> obviously<00:00:28.179> as<00:00:28.449> a

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
not quite his scale but obviously as a

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.010 
not quite his scale but obviously as a
fembot<00:00:29.499> she<00:00:30.099> needs<00:00:30.339> to<00:00:30.519> have<00:00:30.699> more<00:00:31.269> dainty<00:00:31.630> and

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
fembot she needs to have more dainty and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.819 
fembot she needs to have more dainty and
more<00:00:32.820> thinner<00:00:33.820> legs<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.539> arms<00:00:34.930> so<00:00:35.170> I<00:00:35.200> did

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
more thinner legs and arms so I did

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.170 
more thinner legs and arms so I did
think<00:00:36.550> about<00:00:36.780> using<00:00:38.129> different<00:00:39.180> connectors

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
think about using different connectors

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.590 
think about using different connectors
and<00:00:40.510> pieces<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.680> little<00:00:41.980> nooks<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.120> crannies

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
and pieces and little nooks and crannies

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.799 
and pieces and little nooks and crannies
little<00:00:44.370> pieces<00:00:45.370> in<00:00:45.489> unorthodox<00:00:46.210> ways<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.690> get

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
little pieces in unorthodox ways to get

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.590 
little pieces in unorthodox ways to get
the<00:00:46.899> joints<00:00:47.199> I<00:00:47.289> needed<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.949> can<00:00:48.309> see<00:00:48.600> her

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
the joints I needed so you can see her

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.410 
the joints I needed so you can see her
vehicle<00:00:49.989> mode<00:00:50.379> is<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:51.129> Cybertronian<00:00:51.730> car<00:00:52.180> I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
vehicle mode is a Cybertronian car I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.000 
vehicle mode is a Cybertronian car I
didn't<00:00:52.930> want<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.140> do<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.289> convertible<00:00:53.769> thing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
didn't want to do the convertible thing

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.910 
didn't want to do the convertible thing
I<00:00:54.129> could<00:00:54.370> have<00:00:54.519> but<00:00:54.820> I<00:00:55.530> kind<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.590> like<00:00:56.769> this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
I could have but I kind of like this

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.270 
I could have but I kind of like this
version<00:00:57.190> better<00:00:57.460> my<00:00:57.969> my<00:00:58.449> design<00:00:58.809> for<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.280> the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
version better my my design for the the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.970 
version better my my design for the the
alt<00:01:00.460> mode<00:01:00.780> she<00:01:01.780> has<00:01:01.870> her<00:01:01.989> two<00:01:02.140> blasters<00:01:02.739> here

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
alt mode she has her two blasters here

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.770 
alt mode she has her two blasters here
which<00:01:03.100> are<00:01:03.250> just<00:01:03.429> kind<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.730> little<00:01:04.180> handguns

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
which are just kind of little handguns

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.100 
which are just kind of little handguns
and<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:05.860> see<00:01:06.100> before<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:07.030> guys<00:01:07.150> ask<00:01:07.420> she

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
and you can see before you guys ask she

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.660 
and you can see before you guys ask she
is<00:01:08.200> orange<00:01:08.590> instead<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.979> pink<00:01:09.220> because<00:01:09.549> it

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
is orange instead of pink because it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.090 
is orange instead of pink because it
didn't<00:01:09.880> have<00:01:10.030> enough<00:01:10.240> pink<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.990> share<00:01:11.259> any<00:01:11.770> pink

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
didn't have enough pink I share any pink

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.749 
didn't have enough pink I share any pink
in<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:14.320> pieces<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.159> needed<00:01:15.460> so

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
in the and the pieces that I needed so

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.340 
in the and the pieces that I needed so
if<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:16.030> get<00:01:16.090> enough<00:01:16.450> pink<00:01:16.689> in<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.930> right<00:01:17.079> colors

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
if I get enough pink in the right colors

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.840 
if I get enough pink in the right colors
in<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.530> future<00:01:17.799> maybe<00:01:18.009> I'll<00:01:18.250> change<00:01:18.579> her<00:01:18.700> out

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
in the future maybe I'll change her out

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.219 
in the future maybe I'll change her out
but<00:01:19.060> for<00:01:19.299> now<00:01:19.390> she<00:01:19.450> looks<00:01:19.750> pretty<00:01:19.990> good<00:01:20.110> in

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
but for now she looks pretty good in

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.840 
but for now she looks pretty good in
orange<00:01:20.590> when<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.009> get<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.250> robot<00:01:21.549> mode<00:01:21.610> just

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
orange when you get to robot mode just

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.450 
orange when you get to robot mode just
see<00:01:22.030> how<00:01:22.150> how<00:01:22.689> great<00:01:22.869> she<00:01:23.170> looks<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.799> car<00:01:24.250> mode

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
see how how great she looks the car mode

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.730 
see how how great she looks the car mode
I'm<00:01:25.060> very<00:01:25.270> happy<00:01:25.570> with<00:01:25.720> as<00:01:25.869> well<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:26.320> just<00:01:26.350> kind

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
I'm very happy with as well it just kind

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.370 
I'm very happy with as well it just kind
of<00:01:26.799> happened<00:01:27.310> more<00:01:27.549> than<00:01:27.610> anything<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:29.170> too

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
of happened more than anything then too

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.679 
of happened more than anything then too
much<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.799> design<00:01:30.130> issues<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.360> was<00:01:31.479> more

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
much of a design issues so it was more

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.330 
much of a design issues so it was more
of<00:01:31.750> an<00:01:31.930> accident<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.799> think<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.189> looks

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
of an accident but I think it looks

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.670 
of an accident but I think it looks
really<00:01:33.670> smooth<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.210> pretty<00:01:34.420> cool<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.049> and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
really smooth and pretty cool and and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.780 
really smooth and pretty cool and and
pretty<00:01:36.630> appropriate<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.899> femme<00:01:38.290> fembot<00:01:39.189> so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
pretty appropriate for a femme fembot so

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.660 
pretty appropriate for a femme fembot so
again<00:01:40.630> these<00:01:40.899> are<00:01:41.170> from<00:01:41.500> those<00:01:42.070> influences<00:01:42.549> I

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
again these are from those influences I

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.090 
again these are from those influences I
said<00:01:43.000> before<00:01:43.149> IX<00:01:43.719> role<00:01:43.930> that<00:01:44.049> were<00:01:44.439> allowed<00:01:44.710> IX

let's<00:01:53.079> get<00:01:53.170> right<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.350> transformation<00:01:54.189> here

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
let's get right to transformation here

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.690 
let's get right to transformation here
it's<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.210> little<00:01:55.329> complex<00:01:55.899> due<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.670> compared<00:01:57.670> to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
it's a little complex due to compared to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.880 
it's a little complex due to compared to
that<00:01:57.850> my<00:01:57.939> other<00:01:58.119> models<00:01:58.990> first<00:01:59.409> thing<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.619> do<00:01:59.770> is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
that my other models first thing I do is

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.069 
that my other models first thing I do is
flip<00:02:00.100> her<00:02:00.219> up<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.520> her<00:02:00.850> side<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.719> you<00:02:01.840> want<00:02:02.020> to

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
flip her up on her side and you want to

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.370 
flip her up on her side and you want to
move<00:02:02.350> these<00:02:02.619> two<00:02:02.920> bars<00:02:03.399> out<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.380> those

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
move these two bars out like so those

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.990 
move these two bars out like so those
will<00:02:05.590> become<00:02:05.740> two<00:02:06.009> arms<00:02:06.280> later<00:02:06.520> but<00:02:06.729> for<00:02:06.939> now

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
will become two arms later but for now

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.580 
will become two arms later but for now
those<00:02:07.630> will<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.020> just<00:02:08.140> got<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.410> get<00:02:08.500> them

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
those will get it just got to get them

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.930 
those will get it just got to get them
out<00:02:08.680> of<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.830> way<00:02:08.980> the<00:02:09.370> next<00:02:09.610> thing<00:02:09.730> you<00:02:09.790> want

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
out of the way the next thing you want

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.590 
out of the way the next thing you want
to<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.180> flip<00:02:10.420> out

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
to do is flip out

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.220 
to do is flip out
these<00:02:11.720> two<00:02:12.460> sections<00:02:13.460> on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.030> side<00:02:14.330> which<00:02:14.660> if

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
these two sections on the side which if

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.720 
these two sections on the side which if
you<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.560> figured<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.040> out<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.310> will<00:02:16.430> become

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
you have figured it out it will become

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.970 
you have figured it out it will become
the<00:02:16.880> legs<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:18.110> next<00:02:18.230> thing<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.590> want<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.830> do

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.590 
the legs the next thing you want to do
you<00:02:19.070> take<00:02:19.280> her<00:02:19.490> knees<00:02:19.760> rotate<00:02:20.360> them<00:02:20.570> 90

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
you take her knees rotate them 90

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.830 
you take her knees rotate them 90
degrees<00:02:21.170> inward<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.190> both<00:02:22.520> sides<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.510> then

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
degrees inward on both sides and then

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.070 
here and you want to turn it about 90
degrees<00:03:38.620> like<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:40.040> almost<00:03:40.610> 90<00:03:41.000> degrees<00:03:41.080> you

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
degrees like so almost 90 degrees you

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.620 
degrees like so almost 90 degrees you
can<00:03:42.500> make<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.800> 90<00:03:43.010> degrees<00:03:43.070> okay<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.390> then<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
can make it 90 degrees okay so then the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.120 
can make it 90 degrees okay so then the
next<00:03:44.780> thing<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.140> want<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.320> do<00:03:45.500> now<00:03:45.650> is<00:03:45.830> start

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
next thing you want to do now is start

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.610 
next thing you want to do now is start
slowly<00:03:46.520> rotating<00:03:47.180> everything<00:03:47.690> around<00:03:47.990> it

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
slowly rotating everything around it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.590 
slowly rotating everything around it
will<00:03:48.950> go<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.250> just<00:03:49.580> have<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.940> kind<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.240> bend<00:03:50.480> it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
will go you just have to kind of bend it

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.980 
will go you just have to kind of bend it
and<00:03:50.750> contort<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:53.210> way<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.420> want<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.960> to

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
and contort it the way you want it to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.660 
and contort it the way you want it to
get<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.380> through<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:54.860> what<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> want<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.340> do<00:03:55.460> is<00:03:55.580> I

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
get it through so what I want to do is I

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.220 
get it through so what I want to do is I
want<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.910> rotate<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.390> head<00:03:56.570> so<00:03:56.810> obviously

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
want to rotate the head so obviously

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.830 
want to rotate the head so obviously
it's<00:03:58.070> on<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.550> top<00:03:58.790> instead<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.210> the<00:03:59.300> bottom<00:03:59.390> of

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
it's on the top instead of the bottom of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.230 
it's on the top instead of the bottom of
this<00:03:59.930> mock<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.920> yeah<00:04:01.130> it's<00:04:01.700> gonna<00:04:01.820> go<00:04:02.030> easy

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
this mock so yeah it's gonna go easy

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.410 
this mock so yeah it's gonna go easy
today<00:04:02.600> or<00:04:03.230> not<00:04:03.410> yeah<00:04:03.710> look<00:04:04.070> I<00:04:04.190> might<00:04:04.400> okay<00:04:05.360> so

the next thing we want to do then so we
got<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.850> head<00:04:08.060> there<00:04:08.360> on<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:09.050> opposite<00:04:09.560> side

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
got the head there on the opposite side

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.090 
got the head there on the opposite side
and<00:04:10.390> then<00:04:11.390> we<00:04:11.630> want<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.230> take<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.740> front

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
and then we want to take this front

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.730 
and then we want to take this front
section<00:04:13.340> rotate<00:04:13.970> guy<00:04:14.450> now<00:04:14.780> 90<00:04:15.170> degrees<00:04:15.440> around

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
section rotate guy now 90 degrees around

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.069 
section rotate guy now 90 degrees around
and<00:04:15.980> down<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:17.150> then<00:04:17.989> we<00:04:18.560> want<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:19.010> rotate

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
and down and then we want to rotate

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.529 
and down and then we want to rotate
the<00:04:20.169> head<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:21.159> a<00:04:21.189> front<00:04:21.519> looking<00:04:21.939> position

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
the head to a front looking position

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.029 
the head to a front looking position
like<00:04:23.139> so<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:25.330> next<00:04:25.629> thing<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.930> want<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.169> do<00:04:26.349> is

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
get these pieces out of the way so you

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.760 
get these pieces out of the way so you
want<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.120> tighten<00:04:31.479> everything<00:04:31.569> up<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.530> so

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
want to tighten everything up just so

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.499 
want to tighten everything up just so
she's<00:04:33.039> gonna<00:04:33.219> stand<00:04:33.550> nice<00:04:33.759> in<00:04:33.939> a<00:04:34.000> second<00:04:34.360> for

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
she's gonna stand nice in a second for

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.510 
she's gonna stand nice in a second for
you<00:04:34.569> guys<00:04:34.780> I'm<00:04:35.439> even<00:04:35.710> amazed<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.069> it<00:04:36.250> stands

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
you guys I'm even amazed that it stands

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.779 
you guys I'm even amazed that it stands
what<00:04:36.939> it<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.120> light<00:04:37.389> so<00:04:37.719> it<00:04:38.259> will<00:04:38.669> next<00:04:39.669> thing

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
what it is light so it will next thing

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.459 
what it is light so it will next thing
you<00:04:39.849> want<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.030> do<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.300> rotate<00:04:40.599> these<00:04:40.960> sections

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:41.469 
you want to do is rotate these sections

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.779 
you want to do is rotate these sections
out<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:42.099> so<00:04:42.639> these<00:04:42.909> will<00:04:43.150> become<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.719> arms

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
out like so these will become the arms

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.850 
out like so these will become the arms
simple<00:04:45.789> technique<00:04:46.150> pieces<00:04:46.659> with<00:04:46.870> some<00:04:47.439> bendy

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
simple technique pieces with some bendy

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.879 
simple technique pieces with some bendy
pieces<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.840> you'll<00:04:49.840> see<00:04:50.110> in<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.229> second<00:04:50.650> they

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
pieces and you'll see in a second they

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.020 
pieces and you'll see in a second they
kind<00:04:51.159> of<00:04:51.219> really<00:04:51.719> really<00:04:52.719> worked<00:04:52.960> very<00:04:53.259> well

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
kind of really really worked very well

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.459 
kind of really really worked very well
to<00:04:55.030> do<00:04:55.180> this<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.599> I<00:04:55.659> was<00:04:55.810> very<00:04:55.990> surprised

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
to do this and I was very surprised

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.749 
to do this and I was very surprised
because<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.860> didn't<00:04:57.069> take<00:04:57.190> me<00:04:57.250> very<00:04:57.280> long<00:04:57.490> to

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
because it didn't take me very long to

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.790 
because it didn't take me very long to
get<00:04:57.879> this<00:04:58.120> well<00:04:58.840> maybe<00:04:59.139> it<00:04:59.259> was<00:04:59.379> long<00:04:59.590> because

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
get this well maybe it was long because

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.610 
get this well maybe it was long because
I<00:04:59.889> was<00:05:00.039> kind<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.370> sick<00:05:00.639> in<00:05:00.759> bed<00:05:00.940> for<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.270> day<00:05:01.330> so

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
I was kind of sick in bed for a day so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.890 
I was kind of sick in bed for a day so
you<00:05:02.620> know<00:05:03.069> just<00:05:03.490> lost<00:05:03.849> a<00:05:03.969> neat<00:05:04.150> pad<00:05:04.330> there<00:05:04.599> but

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
you know just lost a neat pad there but

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.189 
you know just lost a neat pad there but
no<00:05:05.229> biggie<00:05:06.599> just<00:05:07.599> put<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.930> back<00:05:08.169> on<00:05:08.469> oops

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
no biggie just put that back on oops

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.570 
no biggie just put that back on oops
there<00:05:11.199> we<00:05:11.319> go<00:05:11.759> okay<00:05:12.759> so<00:05:12.969> we<00:05:13.629> can<00:05:13.779> rotate<00:05:13.960> again

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
there we go okay so we can rotate again

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.279 
there we go okay so we can rotate again
for<00:05:15.580> her<00:05:15.669> standing<00:05:16.090> mode<00:05:16.330> you<00:05:16.810> probably<00:05:17.139> want

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
for her standing mode you probably want

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.709 
for her standing mode you probably want
to<00:05:17.349> pose<00:05:17.650> on<00:05:17.860> her<00:05:17.979> legs<00:05:18.250> like<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.590> okay<00:05:21.509> then<00:05:22.509> to

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
to pose on her legs like so okay then to

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.269 
to pose on her legs like so okay then to
finish<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.050> transformation<00:05:23.830> what<00:05:24.009> you<00:05:24.129> want

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
finish the transformation what you want

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.980 
finish the transformation what you want
to<00:05:24.370> do<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.639> now<00:05:24.789> rotate<00:05:25.180> this<00:05:25.330> whole<00:05:25.539> section

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
to do is now rotate this whole section

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.939 
to do is now rotate this whole section
down<00:05:26.229> in<00:05:26.529> front<00:05:27.340> like<00:05:27.759> so<00:05:27.789> okay

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
down in front like so okay

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.450 
down in front like so okay
just<00:05:30.310> fix<00:05:30.550> up<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.879> head<00:05:31.029> here<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:33.250> fix

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
just fix up the head here and just fix

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.059 
just fix up the head here and just fix
up<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.789> head<00:05:33.940> however<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.419> like<00:05:34.629> it<00:05:34.949> you<00:05:35.949> can

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069
