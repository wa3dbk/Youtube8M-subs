00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 and how about friends welcome a and videos 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.300
 channel sb good well this time we're 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.759
 in another script mode 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.129
 Well, it's pretty good but 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.260
 has its pros and cons since 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.260
 well you can eat they have seen the name 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.470
 of the video is called more minerals and good 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.859
 Well, if it includes more more minerals, forgiveness 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.539
 they also include cubes or blocks of that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.699
 mineral that we're talking about well 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 which are not so many minerals but 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.879
 that there are only two which are the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.379
 ruby and the challenge of these no better 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.579
 said this minerals is not found in 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.790
 the minecraft because additions which 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
 It's pretty good and good, as I know 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 These minerals are good 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 these minerals can be kraft as 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.890
 we have to have installed what would be 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 the tumen and there are links either in large 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 espanyol and let's open here here we see 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.920
 the minerals that we have good then 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.920
 these would be the ones that would be to see 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.470
 if the blues are aphids and reds 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.070
 are the rubies 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.040
 You see these four types of objects 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.930
 and then they will prolong that as you can 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.540
 change I had told you previously 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.070
 that can not be changed then as 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.070
 we're going to have when we're going to have 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.620
 to install piping and good links 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 then when they open up to be in the world 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.160
 block launcher and enter a world of 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.410
 exit from message as you see the ideas 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.270
 and he gives them and well, those little numbers 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.150
 are the numbers we would have to 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.740
 put in the air we go to the emea 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.190
 tumini years and let's go from this 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.290
 personalized up here and asks you 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.290
 let's put 200 can only be like this 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.880
 Well, he only added 1 as we come 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.520
 add what would be the cubes and that's how it is 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.890
 with the other objects or the three objects 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.650
 missing with the missing minerals 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.720
 Well you wonder if you can put 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.820
 these objects and the truth is that if 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.250
 we can go out 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.090
 and we are going to try them here, well 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 what 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.230
 we are doing the subject and when 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.360
 let's see how it is done or better said 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.250
 how does it work 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.650
 Well, these minerals do not know why 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.660
 It does not give us if someone knows how to use them 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.940
 which can be on twitter or in 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.709
 comments and all that good because as 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.840
 see this material is pretty good already 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.569
 I quite liked the color and everything 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.040
 that and this one if you can put it and also 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.860
 what I liked is that you can also 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.260
 remove since you have tried other modes 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.750
 and it could not be as good and we will 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.170
 remove these 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.120
 that yes you have to be careful because only 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.660
 with a little touch they break we do not have 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.080
 to wait like me and we already broke several 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.480
 objects we are going to put them again 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.810
 so that we do not miss any of us 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.770
 get us 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.560
 and well, now let's continue with the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.410
 another which would be the block of the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.239
 mineral this challenge well then this 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.840
 have a small error or mobile maybe 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.940
 that the creator did not see that you can not 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.650
 remove that is the only problem or the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.130
 only problem that we have to be left 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.420
 can remove and well we had to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 be very careful when it comes to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.260
 build or use this block since 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.590
 then it can not be removed so that 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.670
 let's put ourselves in creative mode 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.390
 we can remove good so let's go here 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.450
 and well, well 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.310
 but that was the four of them and the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.840
 download link in the description and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.060
 also something that I forgot 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.950
 they will need the texture to be able to 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.160
 ends that I will leave the two links 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.890
 and by fire maybe and well 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.370
 there will be the texture link and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.590
 the link of 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.840
 of the must bar install it in the mode 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.560
 scribe the key storage 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.709
 local import local storage and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.599
 we are going to give we took it downloaded I 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.890
 that I have it, we select it, we give it to 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.260
 back all 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.790
 As you can see , it has now been installed 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.580
 install the texture let's give it the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.650
 key quote always accident launcher and 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.630
 let's explain who he tells me to use 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.370
 textures package and now I have 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.139
 selected then the package of 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.800
 textures and is 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.419
 this is not the sapphire rafi like 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.639
 it should be called is the texture that 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.919
 they will need so they can observe 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.790
 well the blocks are the minerals that 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.610
 they add us and well 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.590
 the link as I had told them 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.770
 downloads in the description and also 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.560
 the credits and the post the universe is 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.919
 in the description too 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.180
 and well, we are also going to put a 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.300
 creative to see that you can 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.830
 remove that block and there we are only in 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.800
 creative is going to be able to be removed since the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.570
 I already tested survival with all the peaks 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.639
 that there is iron and everything is a 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.320
 functional for later so I hope 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.510
