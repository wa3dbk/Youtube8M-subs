00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello present to your attention 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.950
 mp4 player ordered by tinydeal.com 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.769
 package wrapped in Belarus for 50 days 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:18.350
 Dolgovat course but waited kit 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.930
 There was such an adapter for charging 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.990
 charging cable and headphones 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.980
 who are here now we will not see me either 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 lucky enough to survive and so about the very 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.649
 player design is pretty 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.410
 Apple is almost an exact copy of ipod nano 4 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.719
 generations except that on 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.270
 back panel we see the camera from the fifth 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:54.059
 generation assembly quality I would 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.680
 said good enough and so proceed 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.930
 directly to the work player 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.149
 well all the declared functions it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.690
 performs properly except for one 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.150
 this music play is his sound 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.420
 to say the least terrible well for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 I can offer you comparisons like this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 mp3 player for three dollars plays the same 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.930
 like this one for $ 16 but nothing 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.979
 I can't say too much 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:28.369
 bass no syria no middle alone tops 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.369
 who interrupt everything so by music 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.900
 here is such a music player 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:45.110
 well, cute but fun 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.060
 listening to music will no longer 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.390
 There are settings and to lasers, although not all 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.500
 They can be found in order to go to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 player settings need to hold the middle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.650
 button and hold here we see 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 repeat setting equalizer 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.680
 custom equalizer settings 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.570
 music playback speed readings 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.860
 text but also other settings 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.610
 equalizer presets are available here 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.790
 such here but I will tell you not much 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.790
 saves you from the fate of sound 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.239
 self-tuning done only 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.540
 worse believe me i checked go 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.540
 farther 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.810
 video plays video with your 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.299
 resolution can be converted to 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.549
 any converter and watch it well and not 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.689
 I think that it is very convenient but to whom how 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:56.569
 the pictures opens everything is fine and fm 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:59.150

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.310
 very good resolution big 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.150
 very low video quality 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.090
 respectively 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.950
 tools stopwatch calculator 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.049

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:20.579
 snake setting effect setting 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.560
 I honestly don't know why 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.220
 normal and push well can you guess 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.980
 date and time 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.989
 but here it has its own peculiarities 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.049
 player 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.150
 date and time work only while 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.700
 the player is turned on when the player is turned off 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.120
 date gets off and time accordingly 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.449
 setting readings are blackout times 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.459
 screen brightness and screen brightness 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:53.549
 good enough from one to five y 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.729
 I am worth a unit battery saving 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.299
 This is the time to turn off the player 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.519
 sleep timer 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.879

 reset the system and checking Well in 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:20.579
 principle we come to an end the result if you 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.740
 take the player to listen to music then 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.870
 Of course, you'd better take this one 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.930
 player for five dollars almost 5 he 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.900
