00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
greenish color and actually before you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
greenish color and actually before you
even<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.770> started<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.489> might<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.910> wise<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> UM

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
even get started it might be wise to UM

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
dark color perhaps black and then add a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
dark color perhaps black and then add a
layer<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.940> do<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.659> right

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
layer the way you do that is just right

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
layer the way you do that is just right
next<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> trashcan<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> new<00:01:17.610> layer

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
next to trashcan there's the new layer

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.810 
next to trashcan there's the new layer
panel<00:01:20.180> then<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> start<00:01:22.820> messing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
panel then you can kind of start messing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.960 
panel then you can kind of start messing

around with that with the different
brushes<00:01:27.170> some<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:29.180> more<00:01:30.180> tree-like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
brushes some of them are more tree-like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
brushes some of them are more tree-like
than<00:01:30.990> others<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.040> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
than others but you can actually like

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.859
