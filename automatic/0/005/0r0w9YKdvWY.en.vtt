00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
stupid to say and a lot of people won't

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.559 
stupid to say and a lot of people won't
admit<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.120> why<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.299> lot<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
admit that but that's why a lot of

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.500 
admit that but that's why a lot of
people<00:02:48.659> try<00:02:49.079> drugs<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> first<00:02:49.859> place

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
people try drugs in the first place

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.670 
people try drugs in the first place
regardless<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.810> reason<00:02:52.200> people<00:02:52.230> try

drugs I think most of us who have a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.899 
drugs I think most of us who have a
grasp<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.620> reality<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:56.280> invent<00:02:56.549> certain

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
downhill from there I really became a

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.289 
downhill from there I really became a
bad<00:03:30.690> kid<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.199> I<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.829> say<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.849> know<00:03:32.940> weed

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
wasn't the only cause of it but it

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.979 
wasn't the only cause of it but it
definitely<00:03:35.579> was<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.819> major<00:03:36.180> cause<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
definitely was a major cause in the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.449 
definitely was a major cause in the
whole<00:03:37.169> issue<00:03:37.379> uh<00:03:39.169> one<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.260> my<00:03:40.319> best<00:03:40.560> friends<00:03:41.069> me

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
he wasn't into doing drugs he didn't do

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.189 
he wasn't into doing drugs he didn't do
drugs<00:03:50.489> before<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.389> he<00:03:51.599> was<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> really<00:03:52.109> good

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
drugs before so he was a really good

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.990 
drugs before so he was a really good
option<00:03:52.739> for<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:53.010> friend<00:03:53.310> because<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.609> was<00:03:53.790> trying

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
option for a friend because I was trying

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.939 
option for a friend because I was trying
to<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.269> out<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.690> them<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.379> is<00:03:55.530> probably<00:03:55.829> when

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
to get out of them this is probably when

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.000 
to get out of them this is probably when
I'm<00:03:56.069> 16<00:03:56.780> we<00:03:57.780> became<00:03:58.079> best<00:03:58.349> friends<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.709> game

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
I'm 16 we became best friends with game

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.680 
I'm 16 we became best friends with game
all<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.310> time<00:03:59.340> together<00:03:59.699> we'd<00:04:00.090> hang<00:04:00.329> out<00:04:00.480> all

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
all the time together we'd hang out all

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.280 
all the time together we'd hang out all
the<00:04:00.720> time

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
the time

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.689 
the time
and<00:04:01.829> then<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.340> we<00:04:02.699> hit<00:04:02.879> 18<00:04:03.829> he<00:04:04.829> tried<00:04:05.220> smoking

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
and then when we hit 18 he tried smoking

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.490 
and then when we hit 18 he tried smoking
weed<00:04:05.909> and<00:04:06.590> everything<00:04:07.590> about<00:04:07.769> him<00:04:07.919> changed<00:04:09.500> he

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
weed and everything about him changed he

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.670 
weed and everything about him changed he
like<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.639> works<00:04:12.629> both<00:04:12.870> ways<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.470> sense

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
like it works both ways in the sense

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.559 
like it works both ways in the sense
where<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.159> didn't<00:04:14.639> want<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.849> be<00:04:14.940> around<00:04:15.060> him<00:04:15.419> and

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
where I didn't want to be around him and

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.990 
where I didn't want to be around him and
he<00:04:15.690> didn't<00:04:15.959> want<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.199> be<00:04:16.289> around<00:04:16.500> me<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.000> that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
he didn't want to be around me and that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.020 
he didn't want to be around me and that
makes<00:04:18.150> total<00:04:18.329> sense<00:04:18.510> because<00:04:19.380> people<00:04:20.159> who<00:04:20.400> do

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
makes total sense because people who do

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.690 
makes total sense because people who do
smoke<00:04:21.209> weed<00:04:21.650> usually<00:04:22.650> want<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.280> hang<00:04:23.460> out<00:04:23.580> with

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
smoke weed usually want to hang out with

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.029 
smoke weed usually want to hang out with
other<00:04:23.940> people<00:04:24.030> who<00:04:24.479> smoke<00:04:24.750> weed<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.139> people

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
other people who smoke weed and people

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:26.840 
other people who smoke weed and people
who<00:04:26.130> don't<00:04:26.310> usual

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
who don't usual

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.760 
who don't usual
don't<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:27.420> how<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.720> works<00:04:28.140> not<00:04:28.410> always

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
don't that's how it works not always

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.410 
don't that's how it works not always
there's<00:04:28.950> obviously<00:04:29.310> exceptions<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.240> rule

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
there's obviously exceptions to the rule

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.200 
there's obviously exceptions to the rule
but<00:04:30.590> basically<00:04:31.590> we're<00:04:32.250> not<00:04:32.280> friends<00:04:32.640> anymore

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
but basically we're not friends anymore
