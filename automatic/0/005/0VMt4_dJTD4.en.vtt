 Hello guys 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.009
 the video today I will teach you there 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.210
 how to make a printed t-shirt 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.369
 you first need to take a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.220
 drawing on the internet a drawing that is 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 of your taste 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.269
 in my case I took this stretch myself 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.380
 I found the beautiful items 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.570
 one of them is the cap korn and ac by sign is 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 my sign 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.700
 the other two are two drawings with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.329
 I think it's beautiful with a pair of scissors. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.250
 report the black part of the drawing 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.360
 the voice is cut is very simplistic and a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 T-shirt 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.309
 place the drawing over it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.410
 a fabric paint the color of your 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.410
 preference and already start to paint 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.410
 after you painted still wet 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.500
 Drawing corner and leaves 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.550
 shirt dry after dry shirt already
