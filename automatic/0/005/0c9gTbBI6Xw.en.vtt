00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
I specifically love about these is that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.140 
I specifically love about these is that
it<00:02:39.800> has<00:02:39.950> more<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.400> tapered<00:02:40.580> fit<00:02:40.910> than<00:02:41.120> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
it has more of a tapered fit than a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.060 
it has more of a tapered fit than a
boyfriend<00:02:41.420> fit<00:02:41.780> does<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.710> little<00:02:42.860> bit

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
boyfriend fit does so it's a little bit

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.440 
boyfriend fit does so it's a little bit
slimmer<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.520> thigh<00:02:43.730> which<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.210> love

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
slimmer in the thigh which I love

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.760 
slimmer in the thigh which I love

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
because then it doesn't look like I'm

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.680 
because then it doesn't look like I'm
drowning<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.340> them<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.820> overall<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.390> Jean<00:02:47.660> is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
drowning in them so overall this Jean is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.300

now<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.790> last<00:04:36.940> style<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.390> Jean<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.780> still<00:04:38.050> a

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
now this last style of Jean is still a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.480 
now this last style of Jean is still a
legging<00:04:38.500> but<00:04:38.680> what's<00:04:38.890> different<00:04:39.010> about<00:04:39.220> this

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
legging but what's different about this

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.010 
legging but what's different about this
from<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.820> last<00:04:39.970> one<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.870> is

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
from the last one is that it is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.750 
from the last one is that it is
performance<00:04:41.650> stretch<00:04:41.920> so<00:04:42.250> what<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.520> means

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
performance stretch so what that means

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.340 
performance stretch so what that means
is<00:04:42.970> it's<00:04:43.150> basically<00:04:43.330> made<00:04:43.720> with<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> new<00:04:44.110> fabric

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
is it's basically made with a new fabric

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.750 
is it's basically made with a new fabric
that's<00:04:44.740> supposed<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.160> retain<00:04:45.460> its<00:04:45.610> shape

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
that's supposed to retain its shape

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.580 
that's supposed to retain its shape
throughout<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.240> day<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:46.660> not<00:04:47.110> stretch<00:04:47.410> out

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
throughout the day and not stretch out

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.500 
throughout the day and not stretch out
like<00:04:47.620> normal<00:04:48.130> jeans<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:48.790> I<00:04:48.820> actually<00:04:49.210> put<00:04:49.390> it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
like normal jeans so I actually put it

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.940 
like normal jeans so I actually put it
to<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.780> test<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.170> wore<00:04:50.380> them<00:04:50.530> throughout<00:04:50.770> the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
to the test and wore them throughout the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.560 
to the test and wore them throughout the
day<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.310> foam<00:04:51.520> this<00:04:51.700> last<00:04:51.970> outfit<00:04:52.330> just

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
day and foam this last outfit just

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.840 
day and foam this last outfit just
before<00:04:52.930> sundown<00:04:53.320> so<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.890> guess<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.400> can<00:04:54.580> be<00:04:54.700> the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
before sundown so I guess you can be the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.689 
before sundown so I guess you can be the
judge

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.240
