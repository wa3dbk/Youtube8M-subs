continue<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:38.019> gonna<00:02:38.170> cause<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:44.670> try<00:02:45.670> to

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
continue it's gonna cause to try to

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.130 
continue it's gonna cause to try to
survive<00:02:46.739> man<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.090> got<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.330> big<00:02:49.629> loop<00:02:49.959> it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
survive man so we got a big loop it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.750 
survive man so we got a big loop it
looks<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.530> coming<00:02:50.860> up<00:02:50.980> here<00:02:52.980> take<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.160> take

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
looks like coming up here take this take

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.600 
looks like coming up here take this take
off<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:56.920> round<00:02:57.310> Oh<00:02:58.590> got<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.680> really<00:03:00.010> quick<00:03:00.250> I

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
off right round Oh got it really quick I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.000 
off right round Oh got it really quick I
could<00:03:01.510> use<00:03:01.660> my<00:03:01.840> sonic<00:03:02.260> -<00:03:02.500> if<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.890> have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
could use my sonic - if I have

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.640 
could use my sonic - if I have
everything<00:03:03.220> powered<00:03:03.790> up<00:03:04.200> break<00:03:05.200> through<00:03:05.440> some

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
everything powered up break through some

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.380 
everything powered up break through some
stuff<00:03:10.980> basically<00:03:11.980> saves<00:03:12.280> me<00:03:12.519> because<00:03:12.849> I<00:03:13.090> would

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
stuff basically saves me because I would

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.850 
stuff basically saves me because I would
have<00:03:13.450> died<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.900> section<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.620> can

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
have died in that section and you can

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.130 
have died in that section and you can
move<00:03:18.099> in<00:03:18.489> midair<00:03:18.879> which<00:03:19.329> is<00:03:19.510> good<00:03:19.750> left<00:03:20.079> to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
move in midair which is good left to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.630 
move in midair which is good left to
right<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.510> course<00:03:22.720> if<00:03:22.930> we<00:03:22.989> got<00:03:23.140> loose

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
right so of course if we got loose

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.289 
right so of course if we got loose

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
that it needs to just be toned down a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.439 
that it needs to just be toned down a
little<00:04:22.190> bit<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.639> get<00:04:22.789> a<00:04:22.820> little<00:04:23.120> further

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
little bit so you get a little further

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.999 
little bit so you get a little further
because<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.199> really<00:04:24.500> like<00:04:24.710> going<00:04:24.949> through

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
those loop parts and you really get to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.620 
those loop parts and you really get to
experience<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.710> too<00:04:27.770> much<00:04:28.300> unless<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.479> get

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630
