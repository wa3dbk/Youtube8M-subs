00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Congratulations you all right 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.680
 so far you 've been on play 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.150
 This video will also be good 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.890
 it does not matter anyway 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.219
 every case since you in the middle 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 Know to go and a new video one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.650
 video that many of you wanted 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.839
 to have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.330
 It's meanwhile the clock 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.310
 louder and louder is the high school diploma 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.990
 getting closer because many of you are the ones 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.250
 beginning of next year as write 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.140
 and then later on oral abi 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.430
 have exam and that's why I 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 many messages get in from you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.929
 where something was to the help I know 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.460
 not what i should do soon abi 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.450
 and I'm afraid you can not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.239
 give a few tips 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 that yes, I thought I could love 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 because I also have sometime 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 turned seven years ago several 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 It's been seven years 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.100
 but I can already do that a bit 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.870
 Remember what it was like and back then 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
 That's why I thought I'd give it today 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 now just a video with five 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 tips like you do not get along well 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.780
 contentwise but I know it of course 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.370
 not with all the surfaces over yours 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 writes but rather more general 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.629
 nature how to prepare well how 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.760
 you go relax through the whole thing 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 it is partly not very serious so 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 Please not every word on the gold scale 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.680
 but it's worth it on each one 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.930
 I have the video very well 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.159
 designed and it is not that long 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.479
 That's why I would be happy if it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.650
 If you see yourself a few 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.240
 she likes to write tips 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.590
 comments if you criticize me 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 Volt also likes to do that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.020
 comments to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 otherwise I would like to have fun with you now 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 By the way, it is exactly this video 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 not just for high school graduates but 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.049
 Of course, for people the real school 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.640
 Completion exams to the nearest or 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.189
 primary school exam i have 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.750
 just taken off because that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.180
 just a short word is shorter than 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.409
 exam but you can 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
 of course, analogous to others 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.189
 Applying important tests says enough 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.950
 stored 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.990
 Let's go have fun tip 1 is not 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.329
 go crazy okay you are close to it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 graduate and ok now 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.899
 is that what your parents are talking about or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 siblings and everyone ever since 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.970
 speak years 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.770
 the graduation exams 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.510
 support that it is quite scary 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.250
 would like to do it now 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.810
 hide somewhere under the blanket and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.120
 only come out again when everything is over 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.920
 but hey it's not that bad 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.050
 it's a bit like this with the high school diploma 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.580
 as with the driver's license out there 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.770
 so many idiots drive around the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.729
 Exams have passed just as must 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.460
 So go here 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.780
 and why should you just at the abi the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.940
 you have something in your head and be smart 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.010
 why should not you just grab that 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.300
 good question or the written abi 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.250
 testing is basically nothing else 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.540
 as a klausur the easy one 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.700
 that will be written a little longer 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.410
 sounds relaxed and it is too 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.060
 Of course you should not do that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.860
 but you underestimate so far 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.570
 reasonably by the upper level 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.700
 come then he grabs the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.660
 Abi exams also with left makes you 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.400
 so always clear 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 quite other people have the awi 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.930
 packed and that with the exams that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.100
 you know from school life abda ok 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.310
 then it can go on 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.320
 Tip 2 is good planing sounds easy 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.670
 but sometimes not at all 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.920
 has the right plan at some point 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.020
 something completely different, that is a problem 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.060
 write down what you all for that 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.769
 Just know abi know a page 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.540
 Everything is listed neatly clean 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.400
 after that he takes the day of her first 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.620
 Examination and we'll say about it 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.330
 three weeks back to those three weeks 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.790
 now spread all that you have in the end 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.370
 Knowledge is a very simple curriculum 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 So this is the day after day work off 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 can should you in any way 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.370
 problems with the basics have eg 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.959
 Maybe the classic matte then is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.820
 a small crash course not bad 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.739
 There is not much in every city 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.150
 and mostly brings something that course 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.220
 but he should already before the learning phase 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.470
 otherwise it will be a bit too full 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.390
 So make the theme clear and think about it 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.330
 possibly catch up with basics 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.950
 do not let tipp3 distract us know 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.930
 everyone like that is there you have it in front of you 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.570
 actually a huge mountain of work 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.180
 The books will pile up in time 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.370
 short but then dunlop at once 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.350
 this little chat window on facebook 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.030
 but we really want to do it again 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.989
 just a short video at 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.420
 Watch youtube 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.850
 that was it with the attention that 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.230
 Of course, if not in front of the abi 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.820
 you are in the learning phase, seek yourselves 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.190
 someone who controls you yours 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.290
 Mother does not care about your brother your dog 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.080
 just someone who always 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.150
 again , if you look at the matter 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.950
 time and makes sure he does not like that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.020
 just comes to the internet will change to 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.910
 for example, the wlan password or leave the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.260
 Calculator best equal from completely 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.910
 In the evening you can then yes one 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.250
 a bit of distraction but only provide 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.530
 if you've learned well before that yes 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.320
 sounds stuffy but helps attention 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.970
 butchery so huge everything 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.550
 distracts away and someone 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.230
 organize the controlled tip 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.750
 4 stay relaxed 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.160
 yes says itself is so easy but feasible 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.230
 following situation 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.970
 it is the evening before your first abi 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.890
 klausur you are actually top 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.440
 everything is ready and the work is prepared 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.520
 can come but then there is suddenly 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.010
 this voice 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.480
 that voice deep inside you that says and 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.230
 What if you do not have something important 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.440
 have forgotten 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.090
 hey forget this voice who so short 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.650
 Nervous in a book before exam 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.480
 leafing de achieves exactly the opposite 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.100
 he brings himself totally 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.760
 confused and wise at the end less 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.230
 as previously 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.850
 short time another important reform 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.560
 look or two year were 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.780
 Syndicate is okay longer 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.400
 Therefore, do not pause after you have the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.410
 Exams writes all learning stuff 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.480
 Instead, pack away after every lesson 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.850
 make the head free so a round 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.160
 go jogging to the cinema go eat three doner kebab 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.990
 Hotdog Wettessen do not care what 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.380
 the main thing is it has nothing to with the abi 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.540
 do 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.470
 that is anyway after the last exam 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.850
 it does not matter 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.250
 then you have probably even what 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.990
 to do so , go ahead and free your mind 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.790
 no longer deal with the learning material 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.919
 and of course during the exams 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.350
 Eat enough and drink no matter if you are 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.240
 hardly anything gets under tip 5 turns 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.660
 around oral abi and sounds very much too 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.390
 easy 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.430
 The tip is to breathe but stay tuned 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.350
 that means she almost made it 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.190
 but a small part still has to 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.650
 be passed 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.510
 It is important not to sag here now 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.280
 sometimes the oral note can be quite 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.720
 nice to be so decisive 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.060
 you have a good theme prepared for you 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.770
 enough before and then you could 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.990
 watch this video too 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.190
 yes good is self-promotion but maybe 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.870
 it helps here I tell you 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.270
 namely relaxed again a free 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.370
 lecture hold can, it is not so 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.630
 difficult as you might think if 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.610
 you're one of those lucky ones 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.409
 An external examiner is sitting in the room 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.059
 none 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.739
 Almost all of these people are very 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.569
 nice and do not want you anything bad if you 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:09.989
 Well prepared then that works 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.969
 also 

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:13.409
 So also the oral exam seriously 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.229
 although they may be unimportant 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.169
 appears well prepared had the 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:22.939
 everything is done then yes that can me 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.939
 nothing really stands in the way
