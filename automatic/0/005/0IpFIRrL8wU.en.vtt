faceoffs<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.530> little<00:02:05.710> bit<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:05.860> think<00:02:05.920> that's<00:02:06.190> one

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
faceoffs a little bit I think that's one

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.740 
faceoffs a little bit I think that's one
of<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.520> real<00:02:06.670> stories<00:02:07.060> for<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.330> lot<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.630> people

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
of the real stories for a lot of people

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.020 
of the real stories for a lot of people
going<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:09.280> fact<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.700> Red<00:02:09.850> Wings

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
going in and the fact that the Red Wings

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.910 
going in and the fact that the Red Wings
have<00:02:10.149> been<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.420> dominant<00:02:10.660> in<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.170> regard<00:02:11.500> you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
have been so dominant in that regard you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.620 
have been so dominant in that regard you
and<00:02:12.069> Hank<00:02:12.310> really<00:02:12.790> taken<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.480> know<00:02:13.569> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and Hank really taken a you know you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.510 
and Hank really taken a you know you
pretty<00:02:14.140> much<00:02:14.260> split<00:02:14.530> them<00:02:14.740> up<00:02:14.830> sometimes<00:02:15.250> he

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
pretty much split them up sometimes he

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.460 
pretty much split them up sometimes he
takes<00:02:15.760> an<00:02:15.970> awful<00:02:16.120> lot<00:02:16.360> tell<00:02:17.050> us<00:02:17.140> what<00:02:17.319> goes

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
takes an awful lot tell us what goes

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.410 
takes an awful lot tell us what goes
into<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.130> how<00:02:18.220> confident<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.819> feel<00:02:18.880> in

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
into that and how confident you feel in

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.330 
into that and how confident you feel in
all<00:02:20.020> areas<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> ice<00:02:20.770> when<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.040> comes<00:02:21.220> to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
all areas of the ice when it comes to

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.420 
all areas of the ice when it comes to
taking<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.510> think<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.080> best<00:02:23.890> part<00:02:24.280> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
taking and I think it's the best part of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.090 
taking and I think it's the best part of
face<00:02:24.760> off<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.360> very<00:02:25.810> half<00:02:26.020> bucket<00:02:26.290> sell<00:02:26.680> more

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
face off in a very half bucket sell more

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.500 
face off in a very half bucket sell more
easy<00:02:27.280> play<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.950> practice<00:02:30.760> lots<00:02:31.270> in

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
easy play and it's a we practice lots in

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.199 
easy play and it's a we practice lots in
a<00:02:31.540> new<00:02:32.350> practice<00:02:32.590> about<00:02:33.220> faceoff<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.970> now<00:02:34.090> we

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
a new practice about faceoff and now we

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.720 
a new practice about faceoff and now we
have<00:02:34.239> good<00:02:35.019> player<00:02:35.320> who<00:02:35.560> with<00:02:36.160> who<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.489> play

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
have good player who with who we play

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910 
have good player who with who we play
practice<00:02:37.360> against<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.200> draper<00:02:38.620> enough

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
practice against it's like draper enough
