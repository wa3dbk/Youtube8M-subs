00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
a specific gravity test that's a

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.580 
a specific gravity test that's a
graduated<00:03:18.200> cylinder<00:03:20.319> isn't<00:03:21.319> that<00:03:21.410> what<00:03:21.500> they

cylinder at this someone we're judging a
science<00:03:31.730> fair<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.090> I'll<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.750> no<00:03:32.930> clue<00:03:33.140> if

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
science fair and I'll have no clue if

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.660 
science fair and I'll have no clue if
they're<00:03:33.410> right<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:33.680> not<00:03:33.920> but<00:03:34.190> I'll<00:03:34.280> just<00:03:34.310> hope

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:48.039 
they well we're gonna be judging
computer<00:03:39.500> science<00:03:39.890> well<00:03:40.640> I<00:03:41.090> hope<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:47.049> okay

that in the German purity laws or
allowed<00:04:37.599> to<00:04:37.690> have<00:04:37.780> sanitizer<00:04:38.349> in<00:04:38.680> your<00:04:38.830> beer

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360
