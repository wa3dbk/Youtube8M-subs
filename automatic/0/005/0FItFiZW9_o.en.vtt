00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
well pretty much the same that's the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.060 
well pretty much the same that's the
train<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> walk<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.619> play<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.920> next

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
train you walk and just play the next

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.790 
train you walk and just play the next
time<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:39.330> it's<00:01:39.479> slow

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.920 

the<00:01:46.800> next<00:01:47.010> on<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.910> third<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.480> G<00:01:48.660> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the next on to the third on the G it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.360 
the next on to the third on the G it's
up<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.320> finger<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.830> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.010> use<00:01:50.190> I

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
up to you which finger you want to use I

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.580 
up to you which finger you want to use I
would<00:01:51.000> recommend<00:01:51.090> using<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:52.050> second<00:01:52.470> pink

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
would recommend using your second pink

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.650 
would recommend using your second pink
for<00:01:52.800> this<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.190> place<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.970> index<00:01:54.090> behind<00:01:54.510> it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
for this and place your index behind it

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.850 
for this and place your index behind it
because<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.230> involve<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.620> pull<00:01:55.770> off

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
because it's going to involve a pull off

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.040 
because it's going to involve a pull off
and<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.150> your<00:01:57.240> second<00:01:57.750> finger<00:01:57.900> on

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
and so you have your second finger on

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.190 
and so you have your second finger on
the<00:01:58.230> third<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.710> g<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.990> he<00:02:00.990> pull<00:02:01.200> off

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.580 

and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> pull<00:02:05.100> off<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.219> second<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and then you pull off your second to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.570 
and then you pull off your second to
make<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.940> open<00:02:09.739> open<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> G<00:02:11.069> sound<00:02:11.280> out
