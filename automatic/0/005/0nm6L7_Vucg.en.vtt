00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hello and welcome to another last one we have here Pretorias 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.480
 Fund a Roman strategy game in times of the reader 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.269
 our job will be over this last one is glory and glory over 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.779
 to bring the Roman legions Oehrl narrator 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.400
 and I think 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.780
 or I hope in the year has a lot of fun in this last life and I think 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.729
 Just start in the campaign 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.780
 Ebert 4 One Piece ready 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.410
 yes, I just do not think that offline because I've heard that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.570
 the games should be very hard 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.420
 and we start in the market 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.170
 Everyone here can read it again in the year 50 BC 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.650
 future 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.980
 instead of as he recently himself says the Roman provinces beyond the Alps 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.910
 As in the January battle, he celebrates his victory over Helvetia 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.310
 first major military pressure 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.550
 trier 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.210
 he was ordered to secure both banks of the river to see them 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.550
 she is the weather after one 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.310
 in a well deserved rest 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 the persecution of the Falun can take 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 and sport awaits us our first sequence I am now so reassured 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 we are those gestures 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 No 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 lecturer 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.690
 TOOOR 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 bi-spokesman us 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.459
 de 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.689
 jur 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.069
 Hempel Berne 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:28.589
 Vienna the BLE 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.929
 Dr 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:36.939
 Reached February 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.239
 Dr 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.239
 loud 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
 H 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.069
 that was already very much Manuel Schmid and his chapter no 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 five the overpass is also off 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:02.649
 the ARWAG Gaul reached e major in second 58 percent 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:09.099
 b but then the evidence does not just make up the bottom 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.789
 First I have the weights 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.789
 you know the river driven to meet 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.239
 In September, the druid, who has promised and kept the batteries, follows 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.699
 sharpened his popular wars 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.009
 but so far it has not been found out what happened 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.689
 STX as a problem for the construction of a bridge 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.699
 Believe me it is a bridge when TuS Hiltrup can cross into the river 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.129
 yes that is lived the steady you are you come to conquer kri results from the 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.509
 Distribute province 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:46.690
 probably compete 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.049
 I try to see it 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.049
 for the Senate and the Roman fort 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.080
 he has that has been me before 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.920
 Super accurate picture many of us had Mischur our troops 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.789
 you can not even consume it because no 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.999
 These partners will probably only last six or seven minutes each 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.639
 but if I always equal two parts record so fruit and 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.639
 I think we start I first have to get used to it 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.539
 can do anyway 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.509
 but below, information is displayed on hit points the stamina 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.180
 and here 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 we promote aggressive or 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.949
 keep okay 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.870
 to build 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.069
 Spire but all right 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.030
 go already heard 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.039
 archers 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.279
 and style are the cities that like Jamie Jamie once is Deubel 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.979
 and we do not have that today 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.460
 Electricity in the Mekong right up there seems to be a falconer what can 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.300
 because send Dr high 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.219
 but now she must have attested him murder 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.120
 Wants to send Voigt in Falkenau 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.550
 or here 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.759
 and now I can fold it there 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.550
 Euro what a coincidence 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.189
 Photo indirectly launch enemies on us 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.629
 where does that close 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:15.550
 the wrinkles 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.819
 already let 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.349
 and there if we probably 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.020
 who of course immediately in Iran 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.289
 to attack 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.620
 and these fine butchering here 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.620
 "I hope I do not die too many of my friends 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.599
 and here we go 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.599
 we should still take the cities so far 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.909
 and there is now that Risen slaughter against the Helvetii 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.389
 and there Mentrup is coming even more troops 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.990
 Alba seems to have lost no troops until now 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.309
 and one will send high protection 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.309
 No I do not need that 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.309
 and here, of course, equal to support 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.289
 Naturally 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.289
 yes thrown with raccoons 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.520
 and 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.389
 there already have our first case of the lays 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.119
 and then I will not take him back to my child anymore 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.300
 around here Come the break select direction 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.940
 in which direction the groups should look with mouse wheel you have the 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.860
 Possibility the position 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 to decide 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.089
 UD 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.229
 and you can also go through the rest of Stockholm 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.229
 for those probably also hide little courage 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.529
 Schulik and 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.949
 or wait for the next question if this continues with the cowardly 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.839
 then we have no chance and we play already on a subject that wanted 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.229
 I only briefly mention 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.229
 and you can not actually comment on it 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.330
 close 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
 and then I'll be my archers Teltschik 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:07.199
 and stitch that was it for our first Pope 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.569
 nice that she has switched on her soon loss of confidence I on the 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.289
 Slice but next time goes a bit further 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.289
 until then keep your ears stiff and switch back in 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.990
 Holger Bleck Jan Lipke prepares
