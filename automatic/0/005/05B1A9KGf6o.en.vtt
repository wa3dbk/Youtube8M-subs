and<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:03.030> keep<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> unit<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.870> its<00:01:04.049> thing<00:01:04.290> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and to keep the unit up on its thing we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
and to keep the unit up on its thing we
have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> base<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.460> base<00:01:05.640> mounts<00:01:06.060> onto<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
have a base the base mounts onto it and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
have a base the base mounts onto it and
this<00:01:06.630> helps<00:01:06.900> keep<00:01:07.049> mounting<00:01:07.290> unit<00:01:07.710> straight

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
this helps keep mounting unit straight

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.550 
this helps keep mounting unit straight
up<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.689> at<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> front<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> unit<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
up and down at the front of the unit we

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
up and down at the front of the unit we
can<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> completely<00:01:11.760> Disqus

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to move on we're going to take a look

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.980 
to move on we're going to take a look
here<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> USB<00:01:43.979> 2.0<00:01:44.759> ports<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
here the use of the USB 2.0 ports we

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
here the use of the USB 2.0 ports we
also<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:47.340> standard<00:01:47.670> Ethernet<00:01:48.540> port

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
also have your standard Ethernet port

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
also have your standard Ethernet port
right<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.409> also<00:01:49.590> wireless

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
right here there's also wireless

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
right here there's also wireless
Ethernet<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.850> board<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.329> Wi-Fi<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> available

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
Ethernet on board so Wi-Fi is available

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.260 
Ethernet on board so Wi-Fi is available
you<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:53.040> power<00:01:53.220> connection<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.939> then

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you got your power connection and then

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
you got your power connection and then
all<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.689> external<00:01:54.930> audio<00:01:55.380> ports<00:01:55.770> are

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
all of your external audio ports are

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.200 
all of your external audio ports are
right<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.399> your<00:01:56.549> speakers<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.090> your

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
right here like your speakers and your

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.910 
right here like your speakers and your
headphones<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> things<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.680> really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
headphones one of the things I really
liked<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.490> system<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.909> came<00:02:00.180> with

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
liked about this system is it came with

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240 
liked about this system is it came with
das<00:02:00.659> pre-installed<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:01.710> means<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.100> don't

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
das pre-installed which means you don't

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
das pre-installed which means you don't
need<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.579> boot<00:02:02.820> disk<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.960> also<00:02:04.110> came

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
need a boot disk so and it also came

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.020 
need a boot disk so and it also came
with<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> little<00:02:04.979> USB<00:02:05.310> device<00:02:05.729> which<00:02:05.909> I'm
