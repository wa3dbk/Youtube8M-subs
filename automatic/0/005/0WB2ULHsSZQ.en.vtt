let's first talk about the advantages of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
let's first talk about the advantages of
external<00:00:39.180> hard<00:00:39.360> drives<00:00:39.629> external<00:00:40.590> hard

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
external hard drives external hard

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.430 
external hard drives external hard
drives<00:00:41.040> or<00:00:41.370> very<00:00:41.879> practical<00:00:42.540> devices<00:00:42.960> because

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
drives or very practical devices because

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
drives or very practical devices because
they<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:44.219> both<00:00:44.489> cheap<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.239> fairly<00:00:45.930> easy<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they are both cheap and fairly easy to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
they are both cheap and fairly easy to
use<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.430> terabyte<00:00:47.820> storage

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
use you can get one terabyte storage

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.529 
use you can get one terabyte storage
space<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.600> around<00:00:49.260> $100<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.280> Amazon<00:00:50.760> also

those<00:00:51.750> devices<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.770> portable<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
those devices are very portable so you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910 
those devices are very portable so you
can<00:00:53.879> carry<00:00:54.270> them<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.170> times

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
can carry them with you at all times

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.060 
can carry them with you at all times
newer<00:00:56.640> devices<00:00:57.120> will<00:00:57.300> use<00:00:57.480> USB<00:00:57.960> 2.0<00:00:58.590> thus
