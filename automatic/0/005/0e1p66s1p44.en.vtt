 attack so when playing defense 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.000
 If you take for example Zlatan Ibrahimovic 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.410
 up in attack who basically beats out 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.720
 childhood or even you can walk now 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.809
 keeps fit doing karate

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.060
 attacks 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.469
 as for and sometimes defense it 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.709
 intercept it intercepts 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:30.490
 these are tackles and 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:34.459
 tackles meaning you can accordingly 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.770
 get the advantage of having good 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:40.179
 twine in principle advantage can 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.509
 describe the sea â€‹â€‹but this is one of the most 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.899

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.869
 and as for exercises well now 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:56.719
 quickly run through what is here 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:58.579
 very important to open fuck fuck muscles 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.310
 mean how 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.299
 the main thing is that at 5. 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.709
