00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
okay soaps 2014 version of this bulb

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay soaps 2014 version of this bulb
there's<00:00:05.790> been<00:00:05.940> an<00:00:06.029> update<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.810> changed

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
there's been an update that I changed

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.160 
there's been an update that I changed
number<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.410> lumens<00:00:07.770> from<00:00:08.069> 830<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.030> 880<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
number of lumens from 830 to 880 on the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.190 
number of lumens from 830 to 880 on the
set<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.590> shaped<00:00:10.980> warm<00:00:11.340> white<00:00:11.550> bulb<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.330> as

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
set is shaped warm white bulb so as

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.350 
set is shaped warm white bulb so as
always<00:00:13.500> we'll<00:00:13.790> assess<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.820> performance<00:00:15.030> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
always we'll assess the performance of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.970 
always we'll assess the performance of
the<00:00:15.420> bulb<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.780> then<00:00:16.170> tear<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.470> down<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.800> see

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the bulb and then tear it down to see

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.830 
the bulb and then tear it down to see
what<00:00:17.010> differences<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> dimmer<00:00:21.570> test

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
what differences are so the dimmer test

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.349 
what differences are so the dimmer test
obviously<00:00:22.350> didn't<00:00:22.710> ring<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.859> bulb<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
obviously didn't ring the bulb and the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
obviously didn't ring the bulb and the
bulb<00:00:24.480> did<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:24.869> low<00:00:25.109> light<00:00:25.710> level<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.189> as

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
bulb did a very low light level then as

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.980 
bulb did a very low light level then as
you<00:00:26.430> increase<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> course<00:00:27.599> gets<00:00:27.779> very

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you increase it up the course gets very

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.439 
you increase it up the course gets very
bright<00:00:28.199> more<00:00:29.189> importantly<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.910> low<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.179> range

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
bright more importantly the low in range

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
bright more importantly the low in range
of<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.689> bulb<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.560> quite<00:00:31.859> excellent

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
of this bulb is is quite excellent

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.880 
of this bulb is is quite excellent
actually<00:00:32.640> even<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.500> bulbs<00:00:34.770> I've

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
actually even of all the bulbs I've

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
actually even of all the bulbs I've
measured<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.370> dim<00:00:35.550> ability<00:00:36.210> sometimes

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
measured that have dim ability sometimes

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
measured that have dim ability sometimes
at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.320> low<00:00:37.530> range<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> either

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
at the very low range it can to either

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
at the very low range it can to either
drop<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> cliff<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.469> dim

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
drop off a cliff or they just don't dim

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.610 
drop off a cliff or they just don't dim
down<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:41.879> well<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.809> one's<00:00:42.989> performing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
down very well this one's performing

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760 
down very well this one's performing
very<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.989> stock<00:00:45.989> will<00:00:46.140> flicker<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.559> just

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
very well a stock will flicker I just

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.990 
very well a stock will flicker I just
thought<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> frame<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> ball<00:00:47.820> but

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
thought of the frame as the ball but

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
thought of the frame as the ball but
obviously<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.510> shining<00:00:48.719> upon<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.320> solar<00:00:49.950> cell

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
obviously it's shining upon a solar cell

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.770 
obviously it's shining upon a solar cell
and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> solar<00:00:51.149> cell<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> course<00:00:51.629> will

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and the solar cell of course will

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.150 
and the solar cell of course will
convert<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> light<00:00:52.469> back<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.800> electricity

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
convert that light back to electricity

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
convert that light back to electricity
and<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.329> look<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> waveforms<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.140> an

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and if you look at the waveforms on an

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
and if you look at the waveforms on an
oscilloscope<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> sense<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
oscilloscope you can get a sense as to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510 
oscilloscope you can get a sense as to
the<00:00:57.270> amount<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> flicker<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.079> both<00:00:58.230> house<00:00:58.520> now

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the amount of flicker of both house now

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.630 
the amount of flicker of both house now
as<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.690> every<00:01:01.199> Philips<00:01:01.980> bulb<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.399> one

exception that I've torn down

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
exception that I've torn down
there's<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:06.000> perceptible<00:01:06.510> flicker<00:01:06.869> so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
there's just no perceptible flicker so

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.570 
there's just no perceptible flicker so
this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.040> thing<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.280> been<00:01:08.520> a

the<00:01:52.229> original<00:01:52.619> bulb<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.640> was

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the original bulb was this one here was

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.020 
the original bulb was this one here was
great<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:55.259> white<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.619> down<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> fall<00:01:56.700> 2013

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
great the white or down in the fall 2013

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
great the white or down in the fall 2013
home<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.840> video<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
home of that video is here it's the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.280 
home of that video is here it's the
pieces<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> course<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> belt<00:02:01.049> here

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
pieces of course and then the belt here

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.510 
pieces of course and then the belt here
today<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.680> determine<00:02:04.979> these<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
today the way to determine these is I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.190 
today the way to determine these is I
use<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> light<00:02:05.909> meter<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.630> record<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
use a light meter and it just record the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
use a light meter and it just record the
intensity<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.829> light<00:02:07.950> coming<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.580> 10

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
intensity of light coming out at 10

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.029 
intensity of light coming out at 10
degree<00:02:09.270> angles<00:02:09.629> great<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.440> pull<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> graph<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
degree angles great to pull the graph of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.050 
degree angles great to pull the graph of
course

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
course

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.350 
course
and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.310> graphical<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.240> look

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and then I graphical and if you look

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.550 
and then I graphical and if you look
close<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:15.990> three<00:02:16.200> lines<00:02:16.440> here

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
close there's actually three lines here

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.740 
close there's actually three lines here
that's<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> three<00:02:17.250> bulbs<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.569> see

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
that's the three bulbs and you can see

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.130 
that's the three bulbs and you can see
if<00:02:18.870> within<00:02:19.170> measurement<00:02:19.800> accuracy<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.959> is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
if within measurement accuracy this is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.449 
if within measurement accuracy this is
all<00:02:22.319> they're<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.130> same

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
all they're all the same

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.880 
all they're all the same
oh<00:02:23.520> great<00:02:23.970> stuff<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:25.410> means<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.680> evolved

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
oh great stuff that means this evolved

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.740 
oh great stuff that means this evolved
yet<00:02:25.980> again<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.730> falling<00:02:27.120> through<00:02:27.300> tradition

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
yet again is falling through tradition

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.530 
yet again is falling through tradition
of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> two<00:02:28.050> bulbs<00:02:28.260> uh<00:02:28.440> preceded<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
of the two bulbs uh preceded it and it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.470 
of the two bulbs uh preceded it and it
has<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> good<00:02:30.959> light<00:02:31.170> pattern<00:02:32.150> okay<00:02:33.150> looks<00:02:33.450> like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
has a good light pattern okay looks like

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540 
has a good light pattern okay looks like
a<00:02:33.600> good<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:34.140> both<00:02:34.709> flicker<00:02:34.920> good<00:02:35.400> light

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
a good well both flicker good light

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.300 
a good well both flicker good light
pattern<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.450> reasonable<00:02:37.140> energy<00:02:37.500> consumption

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
pattern a reasonable energy consumption

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.130 
pattern a reasonable energy consumption
for<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.550> amount<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.790> lumens<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:40.020> that's

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
for the amount of lumens so that's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.490 
for the amount of lumens so that's
turned<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:41.600> okay<00:02:42.630> talk<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.230> come<00:02:43.350> off

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
turned out okay talk to come off

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.520 
turned out okay talk to come off
obviously<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:45.300> much<00:02:45.570> construction<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
obviously I see much construction of the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.259 
obviously I see much construction of the
previous<00:02:46.860> Bowl<00:02:47.070> because<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.430> glass<00:02:47.970> envelope

previous Bowl because a glass envelope

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.229 
previous Bowl because a glass envelope
is<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> protective<00:02:49.560> plastic<00:02:50.430> coating<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
is the protective plastic coating so the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.009 
is the protective plastic coating so the
shadow<00:02:51.480> too<00:02:51.660> badly

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
shadow too badly

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.590

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
the fall of 2013 it tore down I wish had

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.050 
the fall of 2013 it tore down I wish had
a<00:03:01.650> remote<00:03:01.890> phosphor<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:03.030> see

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
a remote phosphor this one you can see

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.360 
a remote phosphor this one you can see
the<00:03:03.209> yellow<00:03:03.480> phosphor<00:03:04.040> has<00:03:05.040> been<00:03:05.190> placed

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the yellow phosphor has been placed

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.630 
the yellow phosphor has been placed
directly<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.180> LED<00:03:06.810> dies<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.310> old

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
directly on the LED dies this is the old

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.059 
directly on the LED dies this is the old
2013<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.540> had<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.200> remote<00:03:10.410> foster<00:03:10.800> they<00:03:10.890> call

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
2013 it had the remote foster they call

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.370 
2013 it had the remote foster they call
it<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.459> yellow<00:03:11.610> dome<00:03:11.910> here<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.840> then<00:03:13.260> these

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
it the yellow dome here and then these

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.920 
it the yellow dome here and then these
of<00:03:13.709> light<00:03:14.069> bulbs<00:03:14.519> here<00:03:14.790> which<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.420> believe<00:03:15.840> they

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
of light bulbs here which I believe they

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.140 
of light bulbs here which I believe they
call<00:03:16.079> them<00:03:16.200> royal<00:03:16.470> blue<00:03:16.709> idly<00:03:17.549> produce<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.970> deep

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
call them royal blue idly produce a deep

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.640 
call them royal blue idly produce a deep
blue<00:03:18.390> kind<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.720> ultraviolet<00:03:19.110> light<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.410> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
blue kind of ultraviolet light and the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.690 
blue kind of ultraviolet light and the
domed<00:03:19.829> wasn't<00:03:20.190> talked

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
domed wasn't talked

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.199 
domed wasn't talked
oh<00:03:20.730> that's<00:03:21.660> been<00:03:21.870> simplified<00:03:22.200> here<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.209> so

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
oh that's been simplified here and so

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.550 
oh that's been simplified here and so
now<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.329> had<00:03:24.540> just<00:03:24.720> had<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.870> LEDs<00:03:25.230> with<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
now I had just had the LEDs with the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.810 
now I had just had the LEDs with the
phosphor<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.040> top<00:03:26.310> okay<00:03:27.180> let's<00:03:27.540> give<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:28.820> okay

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
phosphor on top okay let's give one okay

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.640 
phosphor on top okay let's give one okay
going<00:03:30.030> bit<00:03:30.209> further<00:03:30.480> there's<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.140> obvious<00:03:31.560> an

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
going bit further there's a obvious an

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.050 
going bit further there's a obvious an
outside<00:03:31.920> shell<00:03:32.250> they<00:03:32.519> have<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> moved<00:03:32.970> away

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
outside shell they have a moved away

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.090 
outside shell they have a moved away
from<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.329> plastic<00:03:33.959> coated<00:03:34.290> metal<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.070> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
from that plastic coated metal just to a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
from that plastic coated metal just to a
powder<00:03:35.790> coated<00:03:36.180> metal<00:03:36.269> that's<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.200> good<00:03:37.320> cost

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
powder coated metal that's a good cost

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.000

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.700 
there's absolutely no chance they can
short<00:05:43.940> otherwise<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:46.110> similar<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.620> the

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
short otherwise it is similar to the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.950 
short otherwise it is similar to the
topology<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.430> previous<00:05:47.700> Bowl<00:05:47.880> but<00:05:48.150> he

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
topology of the previous Bowl but he

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.750 
topology of the previous Bowl but he
changes<00:05:49.320> here<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.590> there<00:05:49.770> nothing<00:05:50.310> too

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
changes here and there nothing too

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.750 
changes here and there nothing too
remarkable

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760

alright<00:05:53.760> well<00:05:54.120> there's<00:05:54.390> another<00:05:54.600> turnout<00:05:54.960> it

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
alright well there's another turnout it

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.020 
alright well there's another turnout it
looks<00:05:55.620> like<00:05:55.740> they've<00:05:55.919> made<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.490> change<00:05:56.760> here<00:05:56.970> at

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
looks like they've made a change here at

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.820 
looks like they've made a change here at
the<00:05:57.180> emitter<00:05:57.330> array<00:05:57.480> and<00:05:57.750> some<00:05:57.930> minor<00:05:58.350> changes

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
the emitter array and some minor changes

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.450 
the emitter array and some minor changes
to<00:05:58.890> the<00:05:59.510> circuit<00:06:00.510> board<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:02.040> cost<00:06:02.280> reduction

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
to the circuit board the cost reduction

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.260 
to the circuit board the cost reduction
on<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.180> case<00:06:04.140> here<00:06:04.440> otherwise<00:06:05.370> bulb<00:06:06.090> that

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
on the case here otherwise bulb that

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.480 
on the case here otherwise bulb that
performs<00:06:06.930> very<00:06:07.620> similar<00:06:07.950> to<00:06:08.100> that<00:06:08.250> when<00:06:08.370> it

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
performs very similar to that when it

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.650 
performs very similar to that when it
proceeded<00:06:09.270> with<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.810> few<00:06:10.140> extra<00:06:10.380> lumens
