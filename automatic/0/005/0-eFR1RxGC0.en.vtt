00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.640 
but I think there's so there's four cars
is<00:02:57.720> cancer<00:02:58.050> there's<00:02:58.230> twenty<00:02:58.470> five<00:02:58.620> percent

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
is cancer there's twenty five percent

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.430 
is cancer there's twenty five percent
hit<00:02:59.129> chance<00:02:59.879> to<00:03:00.090> hit<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> 33<00:03:01.260> five

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
hit chance to hit and then a 33 five

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.050 
hit chance to hit and then a 33 five
percent<00:03:01.950> chance<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.550> think<00:03:02.970> you're

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
percent chance so I think you're

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.000 
percent chance so I think you're
actually<00:03:03.209> you're<00:03:03.930> basically<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.349> third<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.830> get

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
actually you're basically a third to get

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.040 
actually you're basically a third to get
it<00:03:05.129> out<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.459> your<00:03:05.610> hands<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.330> think<00:03:06.750> give<00:03:06.989> her

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
it out of your hands so I think give her

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.240 
it out of your hands so I think give her
those<00:03:07.170> odds<00:03:07.379> if<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.560> get<00:03:07.739> out<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.920> your<00:03:08.010> hand

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
those odds if you get out of your hand

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.410 
those odds if you get out of your hand
and<00:03:08.370> you're<00:03:08.489> basically<00:03:08.760> losing<00:03:09.000> two<00:03:09.239> cars

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and you're basically losing two cars

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.690 
and you're basically losing two cars
anyway<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.560> don't<00:03:10.769> need<00:03:10.830> really<00:03:11.069> matters<00:03:11.370> so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
anyway so I don't need really matters so

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.559 
anyway so I don't need really matters so
now<00:03:11.790> we're<00:03:11.879> gonna<00:03:12.000> play<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> game<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.360> chicken

back<00:06:26.460> down<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.759> seven<00:06:27.060> so<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.449> fact<00:06:27.630> that

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
back down to seven so the fact that

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.879 
Brown game life really doesn't matter
yeah<00:06:29.690> so<00:06:30.690> let's<00:06:30.840> see<00:06:30.960> here<00:06:31.139> Justin<00:06:31.650> it<00:06:31.740> just

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
yeah so let's see here Justin it just

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.170 
yeah so let's see here Justin it just
has<00:06:31.979> one<00:06:32.010> card<00:06:32.460> in<00:06:32.550> his<00:06:32.610> hand<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.940> is<00:06:33.060> in

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
has one card in his hand it is in

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.120 
has one card in his hand it is in
natural<00:06:33.539> order<00:06:33.750> so<00:06:33.930> if<00:06:34.200> he<00:06:34.380> just<00:06:34.529> goes<00:06:34.680> natural

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
natural order so if he just goes natural

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.890 
natural order so if he just goes natural
order<00:06:35.340> search<00:06:35.610> for<00:06:35.849> progenitus

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
order search for progenitus

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.270 
order search for progenitus
that's<00:06:37.380> not<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.560> don't<00:06:37.710> think<00:06:37.979> that's<00:06:38.070> good

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
draw um some way to deal with the tuning

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.249 
draw um some way to deal with the tuning
of<00:06:55.259> zero<00:06:55.710> scraper<00:06:56.100> famous<00:06:56.759> so<00:06:57.030> that<00:06:57.780> is<00:06:57.990> not

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
of zero scraper famous so that is not

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.590 
of zero scraper famous so that is not
ideal<00:06:58.590> and<00:06:59.130> this<00:06:59.340> is<00:06:59.460> a<00:06:59.490> Charlotte<00:06:59.970> now<00:07:00.389> you're

just<00:07:00.750> gonna<00:07:00.870> do<00:07:01.080> this<00:07:01.229> sacrifice<00:07:01.830> that<00:07:02.070> this

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
just gonna do this sacrifice that this

just gonna do this sacrifice that this
is<00:07:03.120> the<00:07:03.240> natural<00:07:03.389> order<00:07:03.720> go<00:07:04.380> get<00:07:04.560> progenitus

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
is the natural order go get progenitus

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.100 
is the natural order go get progenitus
or<00:07:05.759> does<00:07:05.910> he<00:07:06.000> have<00:07:06.090> another<00:07:06.419> target<00:07:06.900> is<00:07:07.020> there

the<00:07:45.990> life<00:07:46.110> lost<00:07:46.380> perspective<00:07:46.650> but<00:07:47.280> that's

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729 
the life lost perspective but that's

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:49.339

really yet you do see the elders he'll
worm<00:07:49.530> in<00:07:49.650> the<00:07:49.710> instinctive<00:07:50.070> the<00:07:50.250> hand<00:07:50.490> and

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 
worm in the instinctive the hand and

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:52.939 
worm in the instinctive the hand and
retention<00:07:51.810> was<00:07:51.990> gonna<00:07:52.139> win<00:07:52.320> the<00:07:52.380> match<00:07:52.650> but<00:07:52.889> I

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:52.949 
retention was gonna win the match but I

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:54.980 
retention was gonna win the match but I
guess<00:07:53.099> this<00:07:53.280> is<00:07:53.460> a<00:07:53.490> this<00:07:53.940> is<00:07:54.120> now<00:07:54.270> a<00:07:54.300> target<00:07:54.840> for

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:54.990 
guess this is a this is now a target for

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.409 
guess this is a this is now a target for
people<00:07:55.380> with<00:07:56.099> natural<00:07:56.550> order<00:07:56.849> tension

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 
people with natural order tension

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:58.730 
people with natural order tension
actually<00:07:57.659> drew<00:07:57.960> a<00:07:58.050> supreme<00:07:58.470> verdict<00:07:58.710> that

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 
actually drew a supreme verdict that

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.320 
actually drew a supreme verdict that
turned<00:07:59.039> so<00:07:59.220> I<00:07:59.370> would<00:07:59.789> have<00:07:59.909> been<00:08:00.000> a<00:08:00.030> clear<00:08:00.240> the

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.330 
turned so I would have been a clear the

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.900 
turned so I would have been a clear the
board<00:08:00.479> I<00:08:00.659> think<00:08:00.810> it's
