song for you to pick up obviously a
beginner<00:02:04.810> play<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.409> bit<00:02:05.590> slower<00:02:05.830> get<00:02:06.130> used<00:02:06.310> to

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
beginner play a bit slower get used to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.820 
beginner play a bit slower get used to
the<00:02:06.490> challenges<00:02:09.090> dc2<00:02:10.090> flat<00:02:11.080> in<00:02:11.260> time<00:02:11.500> with<00:02:11.709> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the challenges dc2 flat in time with it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.009 
the challenges dc2 flat in time with it
that's<00:02:12.280> slower<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.150> you'll<00:02:13.330> find<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.720> chord

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
that's slower so you'll find the chord

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.229 
that's slower so you'll find the chord
changes<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.560> time<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.980> themselves<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
changes in time of themselves and you

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:25.670 
changes in time of themselves and you
can<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.569> nann<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.200> slowly<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:23.319> sever

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
can see nann to be slowly and sever

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.020 
can see nann to be slowly and sever
running<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.160> then<00:02:27.310> gradually<00:02:27.670> speed<00:02:27.880> up

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
running it and then gradually speed up

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.820 
running it and then gradually speed up
this<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.239> best<00:02:28.420> way<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.630> get<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.989> any<00:02:29.319> song<00:02:29.620> is

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
this the best way to get in any song is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.039 
this the best way to get in any song is
to<00:02:29.950> play<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.160> slowly<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.850> musically<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:31.930> it

sounds like the song but only at a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.759 
sounds like the song but only at a
slower<00:02:34.150> speed<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.440> fingers<00:02:35.650> get

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
slower speed and as your fingers get

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.009 
slower speed and as your fingers get
more<00:02:35.920> used<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:37.299> can<00:02:37.600> speed<00:02:37.930> up

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
more used to it you can speed up

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.630 
more used to it you can speed up
gradually<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.799> will<00:02:38.890> still<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.100> musical

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
gradually but it will still be musical

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.449 
gradually but it will still be musical
rather<00:02:39.850> than<00:02:40.090> big<00:02:40.299> gaps<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:45.130> don't<00:02:45.280> want<00:02:45.400> that

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
rather than big gaps you don't want that

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.949 
rather than big gaps you don't want that
because<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.790> sounds<00:02:46.000> very<00:02:46.180> unmusical<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.840> big

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
because it sounds very unmusical the big

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.300 
because it sounds very unmusical the big
gaps<00:02:47.200> what<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.799> do<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.980> slow<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.220> down

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
gaps what you want to do is slow it down

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.090 
gaps what you want to do is slow it down
really<00:02:48.850> really<00:02:48.970> slow<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:50.350> in<00:02:50.620> time<00:02:50.890> with

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
itself much better to do that than it is
