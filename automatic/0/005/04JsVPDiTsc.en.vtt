thing<00:01:04.079> I<00:01:04.170> missed<00:01:04.440> about<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> Bell

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
thing I missed about it was the Bell

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.030 
thing I missed about it was the Bell
wasn't<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.790> aggressive<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.040> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
wasn't as aggressive of the first one so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
wasn't as aggressive of the first one so
what<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.369> playing<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.820> tour<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.540> actually

what I'm playing on tour is actually

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.930 
what I'm playing on tour is actually
again<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> prototype<00:01:11.280> there's<00:01:11.640> no<00:01:11.729> name

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
again it's a prototype there's no name

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.020 
again it's a prototype there's no name
for<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:14.159> pretty<00:01:14.729> killer

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
for it but it's pretty pretty killer

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.899 
for it but it's pretty pretty killer
it's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.369> much<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.760> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it's a it's it's pretty much all the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.429 
it's a it's it's pretty much all the
features<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> liquid<00:01:18.869> ride<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
features of the liquid ride with this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.340 
features of the liquid ride with this
really<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.360> serious<00:01:21.360> Bell<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
really you know serious Bell on it it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.660 
really you know serious Bell on it it
sounds<00:01:22.680> better<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.100> hit<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.640> hard

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
sounds better if I don't hit it as hard

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.750 
sounds better if I don't hit it as hard
as<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.090> used<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.390> hitting<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.720> bell<00:01:25.010> I<00:01:26.010> break

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
as I'm used to hitting a bell I break

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.370 
as I'm used to hitting a bell I break
most<00:01:27.060> sticks<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> bell<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> cymbal

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
most sticks on the bell of the cymbal

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.249 
most sticks on the bell of the cymbal
you<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.600> upper<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you know and so this upper one it's a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.990 
you know and so this upper one it's a
bigger<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.920> heavy-duty<00:01:32.340> bell<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
bigger more heavy-duty bell and the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
bigger more heavy-duty bell and the
sound<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:34.080> knocks<00:01:34.439> me<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.130> like

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
sound of it just knocks me out I like

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
sound of it just knocks me out I like
the<00:01:36.090> consistency<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.619> label<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the consistency when when they label the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.240 
the consistency when when they label the
thing<00:01:38.630> within<00:01:39.630> certain<00:01:40.049> parameters<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
thing within certain parameters that you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
thing within certain parameters that you
know<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.460> might<00:01:41.640> change<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
know they might change a bit but you can

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.530 
know they might change a bit but you can
pretty<00:01:43.439> much<00:01:43.530> count<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.970> fact<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.329> if

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
pretty much count on the fact that if

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.390 
pretty much count on the fact that if
this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> says<00:01:46.320> yep<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.250> what

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
this is what it says yep that's what

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's not a crapshoot you know you know

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.120 
it's not a crapshoot you know you know
there's<00:01:51.540> always<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.840> sweet<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.409> property<00:01:52.979> like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
there's always a sweet one property like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.760 
there's always a sweet one property like
guitars<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.600> might<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.990> four

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
guitars you know you might have four

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.230 
guitars you know you might have four
models<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> same<00:01:56.520> guitar<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
models of the same guitar but one of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.780 
models of the same guitar but one of
them<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.570> speaks<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.200> know

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
them just speaks to you you know

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.970 
them just speaks to you you know
and<00:01:59.060> symbols<00:01:59.750> are<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.900> same<00:01:59.960> way<00:02:00.500> now

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
and symbols are the same way now

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.860 
and symbols are the same way now
basically<00:02:01.490> had<00:02:01.820> some<00:02:02.000> stuff<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.300> my<00:02:02.420> head<00:02:02.660> that

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
basically had some stuff in my head that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.600 
basically had some stuff in my head that
was<00:02:02.930> really<00:02:03.410> consistent<00:02:04.040> with<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.340> wanted

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
was really consistent with that I wanted

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.870 
was really consistent with that I wanted
to<00:02:04.700> hear<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:06.130> called<00:02:07.130> them<00:02:07.280> up<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.580> they

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
to hear and I called them up and they

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.160 
to hear and I called them up and they
made<00:02:08.210> arrangements<00:02:08.720> for<00:02:08.780> me<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.960> come<00:02:09.110> up

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
made arrangements for me to come up

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.780 
made arrangements for me to come up
there<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.380> spend<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.310> day<00:02:10.340> in<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> factory

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
there and spend the day in the factory

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.280 
there and spend the day in the factory
working<00:02:11.180> on<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> which<00:02:11.750> took<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.020> couple<00:02:12.230> of

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
working on it which took a couple of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.470 
working on it which took a couple of
days<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.950> mean<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.270> can't

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
days and I mean just you know you can't

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:26.230 
days and I mean just you know you can't
ask<00:02:14.600> them<00:02:14.780> more<00:02:14.900> than<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.350> know<00:02:25.240> if

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
ask them more than that you know if

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.480 
ask them more than that you know if
you're<00:02:26.450> playing<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.780> Holiday<00:02:27.140> Inn<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:28.340> get

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
you're playing a Holiday Inn and you get

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.010 
you're playing a Holiday Inn and you get
one<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.700> those<00:02:28.790> managers<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.540> said<00:02:29.900> you're

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
one of those managers it's said you're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.660 
one of those managers it's said you're
too<00:02:30.170> loud<00:02:30.380> it'll<00:02:30.920> probably<00:02:31.130> last<00:02:31.340> forever

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
too loud it'll probably last forever

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.210 
too loud it'll probably last forever
okay<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:33.230> you're<00:02:33.350> playing<00:02:33.530> hockey<00:02:33.830> rinks

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
okay when you're playing hockey rinks

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.510 
okay when you're playing hockey rinks
and<00:02:34.340> stadiums<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:36.380> cracker<00:02:36.860> cup<00:02:37.160> crack<00:02:37.490> a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
and stadiums like a cracker cup crack a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.820 
and stadiums like a cracker cup crack a
couple<00:02:37.880> on<00:02:38.000> tour<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.540> just<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.800> know

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
couple on tour you know just you know

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.240 
couple on tour you know just you know
which<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.550> really<00:02:40.820> fun<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.240> must<00:02:41.810> admit

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
which is really fun I must admit

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.990 
which is really fun I must admit
saving<00:02:43.250> probably<00:02:43.550> don't<00:02:43.670> want<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.850> hear<00:02:43.970> that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
saving probably don't want to hear that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.150 
saving probably don't want to hear that
but<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.720> mean<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.080> beat<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.530> crap<00:02:45.770> out<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:45.980> them

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
but I mean I beat the crap out of them

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:58.070 
but I mean I beat the crap out of them
so<00:02:46.250> it's<00:02:46.520> okay

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.300 

this<00:02:59.080> tour<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> say<00:02:59.980> with<00:03:00.159> these

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
this tour like I say with these

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.680 
this tour like I say with these
prototypes<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.150> then<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.299> couple<00:03:01.569> other

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
prototypes and then a couple other

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.170 
prototypes and then a couple other
things<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.319> doing<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.640> stuff<00:03:03.909> a<00:03:03.970> little

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
things I'm doing this stuff a little

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.970 
things I'm doing this stuff a little
differently<00:03:04.480> than<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:04.659> had<00:03:04.810> been<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
differently than I had been this is the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.160 
differently than I had been this is the
22<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.430> funny<00:03:07.239> enough<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.599> one<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:07.810> using<00:03:07.989> on

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
22 I funny enough the one I'm using on

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.890 
22 I funny enough the one I'm using on
the<00:03:08.230> tour<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.530> 21<00:03:09.040> I've<00:03:09.790> got<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> 22<00:03:10.510> version

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the tour is a 21 I've got a 22 version

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.330 
the tour is a 21 I've got a 22 version
of<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.170> one<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.500> prototype<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.069> was<00:03:12.160> telling

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
of the one the prototype I was telling

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.160 
of the one the prototype I was telling
you<00:03:12.400> about<00:03:12.629> because<00:03:13.629> I<00:03:13.720> always<00:03:13.959> thought

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
you about because I always thought

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.930 
you about because I always thought
that's<00:03:14.410> going<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.709> be<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:15.069> but<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.489> 21

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
that's going to be the one but this 21

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.410 
that's going to be the one but this 21
I've<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.239> really<00:03:16.450> fall<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.840> love<00:03:16.870> with

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.339 

Crash's<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.959> tend<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.430> mostly<00:03:21.430> eighteens<00:03:21.880> and

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
Crash's I tend to mostly eighteens and

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.630 
Crash's I tend to mostly eighteens and
but<00:03:23.349> I<00:03:23.380> haven't<00:03:23.590> used<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.860> 16<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.430> years

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
but I haven't used the 16 in years

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.309 
but I haven't used the 16 in years
whereas<00:03:25.060> knowing<00:03:25.690> this<00:03:25.810> -<00:03:25.989> I've<00:03:26.140> got<00:03:26.290> a

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
whereas knowing this - I've got a

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.260 
whereas knowing this - I've got a
prototype<00:03:26.590> 16<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.580> actually<00:03:27.760> got<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.150> go

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
prototype 16 that I actually got to go

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.059 
prototype 16 that I actually got to go
in<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.480> design

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.420 

that<00:03:31.790> China<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:32.599> wacky<00:03:32.870> looking<00:03:33.290> thing<00:03:33.499> it's

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
that China that wacky looking thing it's

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.300 
that China that wacky looking thing it's
a<00:03:34.790> it's<00:03:35.060> they<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:35.989> an<00:03:36.139> o-ring<00:03:36.260> crash<00:03:36.889> I<00:03:37.159> guess

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
a it's they have an o-ring crash I guess

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.619 
a it's they have an o-ring crash I guess
this<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.670> first<00:03:37.700> time<00:03:37.999> they<00:03:38.090> made<00:03:38.239> an<00:03:38.359> O<00:03:38.450> in

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
this is the first time they made an O in

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.020 
this is the first time they made an O in
China<00:03:38.989> it's<00:03:39.439> good<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.709> love<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.549> sound<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.909> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
China it's good I love the sound of it
