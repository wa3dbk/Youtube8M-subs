00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello guys let's see today I'm going to do 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.769
 today other ribs but different from the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 that tells us the other time I was wearing 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.800
 potato tomato and vegetable correction 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.820
 today they are going to be alone 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.820
 we do this we throw salt 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 we do not throw the salt 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.080
 here like this 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.680
 salt is good now 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.149
 brown sugar brings us nothing more oil 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 salt and sugar 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.300
 at the moment caramelize 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.960
 but you see I hope they come out good and 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.960
 I hope you like them 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.380
 true 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.110
 but as I said this sugar woman 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.519
 Well, sugar follows and here is the model 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.259
 the brown sugar has a special table 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.259
 that gives meats 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.600
 you see now pin I do not have it put 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.850
 205 I 've brought it for a while 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.340
 now open they greet the videos of the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.840
 oil children look at a droplet 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.910
 done here now since it's the same 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.010
 it's going to be the same as this loose 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.970
 fat but good a little bit always for 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.220
 to brown 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 it's a little oil and so for the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 under another little look in a little 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 combo water more or less the sauce like os 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 like us the likes of the sauce 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.580
 you know that you like it with a lot of salsa 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.700
 let's make more sauce ask me at 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.430
 look a little less cachito the water a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.070
 trickle of olive oil 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.020
 and a splash of olive oil 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.580
 because people when when it can be 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.050
 It seems that expresses this broth to make 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.160
 that by the pesito 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.160
 a little salt 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.070
 a lemon bar 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.260
 you see the digital when it has already been cooked 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.570
 that the change is already made the lemon and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.810
 then I explain lemon at the bottom of the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.810
 lemon 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.420
 that and now I'm going to throw 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.950
 a little bit of a little wine and a 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.950
 little pill of her 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.629
 when they send us a box of bottles 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.269
 then we will do the propagation of 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.870
 already tried or propaganda no one will listen 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.490
 a little trickle but this one we are going to take 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.450
 when you bring the broth knowing already as 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.450
 when you are finished 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:02.450
 and I say when the sauce is 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.420
 [Music] 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.310
 well you see the caldito is already made for 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.310
 the right 2 tablespoons of sweet wine 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.550
 two teaspoons of sweet wine 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.160
 right away doing it by throwing the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.630
 salsita I told you that I had made 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.970
 I've done a little bit like that but not what 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.370
 above just made here in the tray and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.350
 Now, as the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.550
 really another ten minutes and I'm going 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.780
 to do because I'm going to express it 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.770
 little sauce with a little bit of 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.440
 cornstarch 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.060
 once like this the Salseta as has 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.360
 she was a little bit soft and she put a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.770
 teaspoon of cornstarch if there is exposed and 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.960
 has made sauce that is made 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.880
 so that the illiterate more throwing and already 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.310
 is 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.860
 this is already waking the boys now 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.510

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.400
