battlefield<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> completely<00:00:55.949> different

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
battlefield is a completely different

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.119 
battlefield is a completely different
game<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.270> you're<00:00:57.989> obviously<00:00:58.230> neural<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
game and you're obviously neural it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.770 
game and you're obviously neural it's
completely<00:00:59.430> different<00:00:59.640> game<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.910> no<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
completely different game but no it is a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
completely different game but no it is a
completely<00:01:01.440> different<00:01:02.219> game<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> first

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
completely different game it's a first

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.280 
completely different game it's a first
person<00:01:03.149> shooter<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:03.780> about<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> has

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
person shooter that's about all it has

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
person shooter that's about all it has
in<00:01:04.470> common<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.799> call<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> duty<00:01:05.309> there's<00:01:05.729> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in common with call of duty there's so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
in common with call of duty there's so
many<00:01:06.630> differences<00:01:07.470> between<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> two<00:01:08.340> games

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
many differences between the two games

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.190 
many differences between the two games
is<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.540> pretty<00:01:09.840> tough<00:01:09.990> learning

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is it's actually a pretty tough learning

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.780 
is it's actually a pretty tough learning
curve<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.040> guys<00:01:11.130> see<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.610> first

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
curve as you guys see I get my first

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520 
curve as you guys see I get my first
step<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.299> video<00:01:12.659> anyway<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.290> they

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
step of this video anyway because they

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
step of this video anyway because they
were<00:01:13.619> definitely<00:01:13.890> pushed<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.640> far

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
were definitely pushed back pretty far

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that's whole points be over push back we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.499 
that's whole points be over push back we
have<00:01:16.590> 1m<00:01:16.890> compensation<00:01:17.460> left<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.360> pull

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
have 1m compensation left we can't pull

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.640 
have 1m compensation left we can't pull
this<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.780> at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> end<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> show<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> to
