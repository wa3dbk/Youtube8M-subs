00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 however hello and welcome 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.810
 to the server hiipixel and today still 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.650
 one new series of games and a tyrant in the shadow 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.309
 let's pick a server before pick a server 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 and start the game so here's a tinker for 24 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.119
 man's my favorite card since she 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.279
 more than a server on on on on on 12 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.279
 man and so people almost all plucked up 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.619
 22 23 people let's wait for two more 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.630
 man waiting for the game begins the point is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.859
 that failed the floor is just repeat 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 Aw each series so as not you 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.520
 unknown on what series you can 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.210
 stumble maybe you see me 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.530
 first time so you should know the gender 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 fails you need to stay last 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 there are several levels well and now i'm 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 went countdown 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and nonsense 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.559
 it all started all fucking oh my god 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 fails look the floor should 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 fail yes fail now 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.690
 very scary look how many people and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 everybody is running trying to resist here on 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 in fact, the first to stay is very difficult 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 I have never managed this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.299
 If you of course watched all series of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.400
 how do i play this crap first 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 I never stayed more precisely not the last 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.130
 stayed not won first place to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.049
 Sorry, but I'm still happy that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.229
 I can play it as it is 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.840
 I wonder not even consider the fact that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.189
 leave a huge number of people 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 I still do not lag about it and I 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 also spoke repeated almost all series not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.040
 I know why I repeat this probably all 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.140
 because there is nothing more to say 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 it happens too 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.149
 fuck a fool and what else to tell 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.750
 you're interested because how would you 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.439
 see what happens on the screen and about 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.240
 it's not like talking too 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.689
 interesting as I think they are blind 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.250
 look and if they look and let's guys 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.920
 I will tell you, I jump 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 i run i jump i run i'm in ahu i would 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.670
 fell i jump i run and they run now 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.800
 i run and now i'm not jumping i'm here 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.959

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.600
 full would 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 and we need something interesting to do pancake 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.030
 it's getting really scary now 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.380
 and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.010
 and difficult on since then from here here 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.320
 very neat because someone

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.420
