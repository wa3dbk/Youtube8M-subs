00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 You know that coffee all 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 days then you know you can kill 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.809
 This way I'm serious. 150 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.059
 milligrams per kilogram of your body is the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.820
 enough to give you a good dose 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.670
 if for example you weigh 70 kilos you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.830
 would require 14 thousand milligrams of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 caffeine at one and the same time 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 every cup of coffee we drink has 150 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.859
 milligrams of caffeine or 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 you have an overdose you need 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.570
 150 milligrams per kilogram of your body 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239
 if you think of that soon 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.040
 would need baby 70 bodies at one time 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.840
 what would be impossible for his hair 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.879
 stomach although the end is a drug 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.410
 used as plant defense against 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.780
 the insects and that in the active principle 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.149
 can be synthesized in laboratories. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 have a very powerful hallucinogenic effect 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 strong attack on cocaine have this 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.449
 to use thermogenics with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.309
 caffeine can be dangerous 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.989
 without medical monitoring of caffeine 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 stimulates the production of adrenaline which 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 makes your circulation breath and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 heartbeat increase and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 energy and can also cure depression 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.920
 decrease dopamine 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 Why does coffee make us so good? 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.580
 the effect is simple when we are 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 agreed upon a substance called 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 adenosine starts to connect with 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.430
 brain that in turn possesses 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.619
 connectors for it this does not make it 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 end of the day we got tired of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.650
 while we drank that coffee 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 caffeine has a very similar shape 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.640
 with adenosine it starts to connect 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.189
 with the remaining connections remaining 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 expelling those that were already coupled 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 This makes it hard for you to stay awake or 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.250
 With brain time you 're missing 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.470
 of the presence of the substance then it creates 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.450
 new connections to capture the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.460
 plant with more open connections 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.650
 You need more caffeine to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.689
 feel awake caffeine goes away 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.759
 in a cycle of six hours half of that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.640
 you have in your body, that is, if you 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.250
 drank one cup 150 milligrams of caffeine 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.130
 here six hours your body will have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.790
 75 milligrams after another six hours 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.740
 half of that 37.5 and so on 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.200
 to end the matter with 37 points five 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.570
 milligrams in your body adenosine back 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.579
 connect with the brain as now 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.069
 your brain has more open connections 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.989
 more adenosine connects with brain 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.940
 making you feel as if a 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.020
 train had passed over you 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.360
 to eliminate within 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.920
 Come on, you finally feel better. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.920
 nothing like a good night's sleep
