00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.890
 beauty talks to people who say that with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 You're the max and I was the next one. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 here to talk to you about a series 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.730
 news that the band released on the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.400
 things that will be implemented in the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.560
 next must be the king of the possessed and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.719
 there are some things that are good other 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.090
 I'm not going to tell you much about them here. 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.760
 you and I will give my opinion on the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.770
 beauty 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 the first of the great novelties that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.270
 band spoke 'is going to be that the system of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 character evolution how we 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.950
 we increase the character's ego will change 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 from that dlc 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.699
 we know that presently we have to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 arriving first takes the listener's form 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.250
 traditional rpg is to kill enemies 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.899
 make the contracts to win xp and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 from this level 20 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.610
 We have to pick up equipment that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 increases our light level to reach 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.010
 up to the maximum level currently 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 34 and from the king of the possessed not 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 it will be more necessary to increase the level 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.430
 lawn light is actually not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.200
 it will be necessary will not have more 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.920
 level of light in the armors so that they 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 they spoke 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.689
 we'll just need 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 keep gaining xp in experience 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.829
 kill the enemies make the contracts 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.170
 among other things and we can 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.750
 way to reach the maximum level that will be 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 increased from 34 to currently at the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.420
 40 is to win the following look only imagine 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.979
 You who work in neighborhoods and play 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.659
 a certain time like me playing since the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.759
 open other people who started 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.340
 lacking time too but that is already 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.439
 He dedicated the game we devoted much 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 time to get their armor to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.780
 to be able to evolve the character the level 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.450
 maximum and which will start from now 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.000
 the match must be but simply has 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.530
 that raise the level with xp kill the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.250
 enemies will no longer need the level 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.229
 of light 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.299
 this in a way unfair people 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.060
 Do you think that you spent all your time in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.000
 networks doing things spent their time 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.780
 if indicated and nothing you will be all this 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.850
 effort practically 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.130
 in vain because whoever starts now goes 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.380
 simply pa your character with only 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.240
 xp for those who are starting to be good 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.670
 for who is already a veteran who plays the time 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.100
 It sure will not be good. 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.470
 besides bland that if you 're level 34 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.209
 now you will step the characters to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.400
 from level 34 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.770
 if you created a character from scratch 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.470
 after already owe and you'll Father 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.239
 zero level alpharetta that will be the maximum 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.180
 only with xp you will not need it any more 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.459
 light level is on the armor 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.410
 they spoke before the best armor 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.420
 will have some advantages in ports or 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.209
 something like that but you will not have it any more 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.860
 this advantage of light is something else that 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.610
 have said that it will also change the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.680
 Rewards game luti system 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.300
 It's funny that it was because we know 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.519
 that mourning today am very 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.459
 crazy man yes I think it does not have 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.800
 almost no criterion if you have 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.380
 a weapon or if you do not have a weapon at 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.050
 times the guy has top five gets there 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.150
 dropa sexta and a guy playing from the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.230
 never took any and never gave 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.670
 no pro cara 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.739
 they said that this system of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.049
 reward and luti system will be 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.140
 much more elaborate and catch with the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.090
 line that ensures greater is only the system 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.360
 of reward they said that the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.549
 responsible figure that has what it is 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.500
 so in every game there is a schedule and 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.230
 has an algorithm that is responsible for you 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.260
 catch some gun another morning 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.150
 will not be changed so that the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.790
 weapons you have to invent the rules 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.430
 that you have your character is came with 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.130
 less frequency repeatedly than 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.109
 You get more new weapons. 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.180
 Talk about guns and something else. 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.690
 They also told you that I did not like them. 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.640
 it was not at all that the actual weapons they 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.380
 they are weapons of the first year they 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.540
 consider whether the first year of destiny 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.549
 and then in year 2 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.380
 the 1st year weapons all weapons that 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.579
 even this must be the last one that went to 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.400
 wolves house 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.680
 they will not further increase the damage 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.049
 currently the last one and that was the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.660
 At the end of Trotta , the Wolves' 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.210
 People, bota use one and I say hysterical. 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.350
 because of the future we put 10 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.350
 technique on the gun and it 's time 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.200
 365 damage from the next and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.680
 This sar but will not increase the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.270
 damage they will not be improved any more 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.480
 they want what the guys with 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.060
 sure they want to force people to 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.610
 use new weapons new weapons 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.100
 that will be made available in the game 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.040
 so in a way when a 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.380
 new thing the tendency is that both the 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.450
 how much people want to use 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.820
 new things if they are good of course 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.070
 in those crap but on the other hand 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.800
 also galera certain weapons that the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.030
 people fought to get as soon as the 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.900
 show alone right? 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.300
 herald martel negro several weapons are 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.400
 weapons that we consider as weapons 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.520
 that we would really like 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.130
 having new and better weapons until we 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.930
 I would like to keep using them 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.190
 a compatible way that we could 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.710
 kill enemies in a way 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.330
 compatible with their strength 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.070
 they said they will not stay 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.840
 obsolete, you know we'll be able to 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.300
 use but continue 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.300
 Sorry, they will continue to be good. 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.700
 but will not increase damage 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.530
 then you will be forced to use 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.510
 younger but okay 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.360
 Another thing, too, guys are 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.530
 ghost voice actor 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.600
 american right 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.510
 he's going to change, I'm just going to change 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.010
 all the ghost dubbing and now it goes 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.470
 be each the name of the guy who will be the 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.660
 New north is the guy who dubs the ney 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.910
 chartered tank will be a new 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.070
 side of the American ghost there they go 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.950
 to exchange car dubbing had one of them 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.330
 8 each double stop critical worldwide 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.460
 speech is crap guys 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.110
 simply change all the dubbing to 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.720
 Brazilian version will be dubbed by 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.210
 The Brazilian band is going to be 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.830
 I think the Brazilian version is ours. 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.470
 I'm done with the voice, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.760
 guys, but the Brazilian version I think 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.860
 will continue the same because this 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.090
 ghost in these last days 6 not 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.280
 said nothing, right? 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.130
 but I think it will continue the same 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.520
 voice actor for the Brazilian version not 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.440
 It was like this is what I feel from the band is that 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.350
 as a company, right? 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.160
 she aims at profits so she wants to attract 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.729
 more and more new players and hungry 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.319
 but the game 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.749
 getting old will pass the time 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.729
 game this game is getting medium 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:46.159
 obsolete in a way for the new 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.870
 players and they have to attract the 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.849
 some way and what I see 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.339
 are trying to attract facilitated the game 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.199
 for those who are going to start we are 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.819
 accustomed to playing the Pope only 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:59.210
 microphone is already used to whom 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.520
 plays destiny is the veterans always be 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.099
 back behind always be 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.490
 passed in the sense that the 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:09.620
 people try everything and everything 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.330
 suddenly something new comes out and everything that 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.399
 we made ends up being in vain 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.110
 Look at this, people, let's wait. 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.899
 see exactly how this new one will be 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.479
 system I'm already half goatherd 

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:21.830
 but you can not rush it 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.719
 This is it people, I hope you have 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.099
