with regard to this or North Korea those

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.460 
with regard to this or North Korea those
are<00:03:01.310> obviously<00:03:01.670> drastic<00:03:02.150> exaggerations<00:03:02.930> of

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
are obviously drastic exaggerations of

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.100 
are obviously drastic exaggerations of
course<00:03:04.280> but<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.940> starts<00:03:05.270> somewhere<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.930> it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
course but it starts somewhere and it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.260 
course but it starts somewhere and it
starts<00:03:06.470> with<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:07.040> stories<00:03:07.550> like<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.940> and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
starts with with stories like this and

starts with with stories like this and
so<00:03:09.140> people<00:03:09.950> need<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.340> realize<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.700> we<00:03:11.060> can't

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
so people need to realize that we can't

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.510 
so people need to realize that we can't
just<00:03:11.540> be<00:03:11.720> we<00:03:12.380> can't<00:03:12.620> be<00:03:12.740> complacent<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.400> we

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
just be we can't be complacent and we

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.020 
just be we can't be complacent and we
can't<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.940> be<00:03:14.420> ignorant<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> this
