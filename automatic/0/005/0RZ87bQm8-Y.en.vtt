00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.540 

this<00:00:16.810> is<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:17.910> forklift<00:00:18.910> robot<00:00:19.510> kit<00:00:20.040> that<00:00:21.040> comes

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
this is a forklift robot kit that comes

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.950 
this is a forklift robot kit that comes
as<00:00:21.790> a<00:00:21.820> wired<00:00:22.650> model<00:00:23.650> that<00:00:23.920> you<00:00:24.040> assemble

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
as a wired model that you assemble

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880 
as a wired model that you assemble
here's<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.200> original<00:00:26.970> wired<00:00:28.200> remote<00:00:29.200> control

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
here's the original wired remote control

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.910 
here's the original wired remote control
and<00:00:30.310> it's<00:00:30.430> not<00:00:30.790> that<00:00:31.029> much<00:00:31.180> fun<00:00:31.770> for<00:00:32.770> one

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
and it's not that much fun for one

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.340 
and it's not that much fun for one
reason<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:34.120> cord<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.600> only<00:00:34.780> about<00:00:35.079> three

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
reason the the cord is only about three

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.470 
reason the the cord is only about three
feet<00:00:35.530> long<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:38.250> first<00:00:39.250> built<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:40.360> way

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
feet long and I first built it the way

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.780 
feet long and I first built it the way
it<00:00:40.540> was<00:00:40.720> supposed<00:00:40.810> to<00:00:41.079> be<00:00:41.230> built<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.770> then<00:00:42.460> did

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
it was supposed to be built and then did

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.509 
it was supposed to be built and then did
a<00:00:43.300> complete<00:00:44.140> radio<00:00:44.649> control<00:00:45.840> conversion

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
a complete radio control conversion

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.779 
a complete radio control conversion
there's<00:00:48.519> really<00:00:48.699> no<00:00:50.190> extra<00:00:51.190> room<00:00:51.399> on<00:00:51.609> the

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
there's really no extra room on the

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.020 
there's really no extra room on the
inside<00:00:52.179> of<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.660> model<00:00:53.289> all<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.129> has<00:00:54.309> is<00:00:54.339> motors

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
inside of the model all it has is motors

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.209 
inside of the model all it has is motors
in<00:00:55.239> no<00:00:55.390> space<00:00:55.690> for<00:00:55.989> batteries<00:00:56.469> or<00:00:56.710> any

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
in no space for batteries or any

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.630 
in no space for batteries or any
electronics<00:00:57.969> so<00:00:58.210> all<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:59.429> electronics<00:01:00.429> had

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
electronics so all the electronics had

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.070 
electronics so all the electronics had
to<00:01:00.820> be<00:01:01.530> fitted<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.829> outside<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.609> model

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to be fitted on the outside of the model

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.930 
to be fitted on the outside of the model
and<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.350> see<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.070> model<00:01:06.700> with<00:01:06.909> the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
and you can see is the model with the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.140 
and you can see is the model with the
new<00:01:07.240> remote<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.740> remote<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.730> all<00:01:09.940> the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
new remote the remote and all the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.880 
new remote the remote and all the
electronics<00:01:11.550> excluding<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.700> battery<00:01:13.890> came

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
electronics excluding the battery came

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.340 
electronics excluding the battery came
off<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.850> gutted<00:01:17.190> Kyosho<00:01:18.190> blizzard<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:20.200> is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
off of a gutted Kyosho blizzard which is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.359 
off of a gutted Kyosho blizzard which is
a<00:01:20.380> snowcat<00:01:21.600> radio-controlled<00:01:22.600> model<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.649> I

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
a snowcat radio-controlled model and I

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
a snowcat radio-controlled model and I
converted<00:01:24.880> that<00:01:24.909> to<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:26.909> brushless<00:01:27.909> setup<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:28.899> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
converted that to a brushless setup so I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.649 
converted that to a brushless setup so I
harvested<00:01:30.040> all<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.299> electronics<00:01:31.299> from<00:01:31.450> the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
harvested all the electronics from the

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.950 
harvested all the electronics from the
app<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.399> installed<00:01:33.399> it<00:01:33.610> on<00:01:33.820> here<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.450> here's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
app and installed it on here and here's

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.370 
app and installed it on here and here's
the<00:01:35.049> back<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:36.000> unit<00:01:37.030> which<00:01:37.450> has<00:01:37.689> all<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
the back of the unit which has all the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.069 
the back of the unit which has all the
electronics<00:01:39.299> which<00:01:40.299> includes<00:01:40.750> three

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
electronics which includes three

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.260

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
separate speed controllers for forward

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
separate speed controllers for forward
reverse<00:01:43.920> turning<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.159> for<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.020> forklift<00:01:47.020> the
