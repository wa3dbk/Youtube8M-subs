of the time when people miss it clean
they<00:00:38.430> miss<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> forward<00:00:39.570> they<00:00:39.840> catch<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
demonstrate that forward collapse what

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
demonstrate that forward collapse what
we're<00:00:57.899> trying<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> create<00:00:58.829> better

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
we're trying to do is create better

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
we're trying to do is create better
motor<00:01:00.000> recruitment<00:01:00.629> remember<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.190> an

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
motor recruitment remember that it's an

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
motor recruitment remember that it's an
electronic<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.480> electrical<00:01:03.510> impulse<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
electronic or electrical impulse that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.880 
electronic or electrical impulse that
allows<00:01:04.949> us<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.810> gather<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.500> generate

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
allows us to are to gather or generate

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.910 
allows us to are to gather or generate
more<00:01:08.040> force<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:10.409> shaking

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
more force with that with I see shaking

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
more force with that with I see shaking
like<00:01:11.040> okay<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:12.000> rather<00:01:12.270> rather<00:01:12.840> zip<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
like okay you get rather rather zip that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950 
like okay you get rather rather zip that
allows<00:01:13.619> us<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.830> gather<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.850> entire<00:01:15.270> motor

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
allows us to gather the entire motor

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
allows us to gather the entire motor
recruitment<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.040> muscles<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.490> basically

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
recruitment of the muscles so basically

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
recruitment of the muscles so basically
this<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.170> better<00:01:19.409> motor

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this if we can get better motor

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
this if we can get better motor
recruitment<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.580> hold<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.090> contraction

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
recruitment we can hold that contraction

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.140 
recruitment we can hold that contraction
longer<00:01:22.110> how<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.369> train<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
longer how do we do that we train it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.200 
longer how do we do that we train it
with<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.409> AH<00:01:25.439> stability<00:01:26.220> holds<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> static

with the AH stability holds with static

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.280 
with the AH stability holds with static
holds<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.840> how<00:01:27.930> we're<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> do

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
holds and this is how we're going to do

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
holds and this is how we're going to do
it<00:01:28.350> would<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.799> take<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:29.310> weight<00:01:29.640> stage

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it would it take that same weight stage

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.780 
it would it take that same weight stage
versus<00:01:30.570> 95<00:01:31.020> pounds<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.560> say<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.890> 350<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
versus 95 pounds or say was 350 it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.520 
versus 95 pounds or say was 350 it
doesn't<00:01:33.210> matter<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:33.720> we're<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> have

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
doesn't matter right we're going to have

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
we're doing we're optimizing function to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.059 
we're doing we're optimizing function to
optimize<00:03:01.560> performance

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
optimize performance

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.309
