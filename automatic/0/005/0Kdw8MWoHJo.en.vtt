00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
previous video it feels interesting a

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.990 
previous video it feels interesting a
little<00:01:54.290> rough<00:01:54.560> but<00:01:54.770> I've<00:01:55.250> found<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.880> with

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
little rough but I've found that with

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.490 
little rough but I've found that with
time<00:01:56.299> it<00:01:56.509> starts<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.930> feel<00:01:57.110> better<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
time it starts to feel better and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.800 
time it starts to feel better and
overall<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:57.950> lot<00:01:58.219> softer<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.479> still<00:01:59.659> get<00:01:59.750> a

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
overall a lot softer but you still get a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.330 
overall a lot softer but you still get a
good<00:02:00.110> grip<00:02:00.289> which<00:02:00.469> is<00:02:00.590> important<00:02:00.979> since<00:02:01.100> it's

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
good grip which is important since it's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.850

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
here though they backed a lot about the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.530 
here though they backed a lot about the
IPS<00:02:22.070> screen<00:02:22.100> being<00:02:22.519> able<00:02:22.609> to<00:02:22.730> respond<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.269> even

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
IPS screen being able to respond to even

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.120 
IPS screen being able to respond to even
the<00:02:23.660> slightest<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.200> touches<00:02:24.530> because<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
the slightest of touches because of the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.890 
the slightest of touches because of the
thin<00:02:25.370> gap<00:02:25.609> between<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.120> touch<00:02:26.329> sensor<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
thin gap between the touch sensor and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.289 
thin gap between the touch sensor and
the<00:02:27.260> display<00:02:27.590> panel<00:02:27.769> well<00:02:28.519> it's<00:02:28.820> awful

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
that the camera is a little slow and

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.860 
that the camera is a little slow and
don't<00:04:40.789> get<00:04:40.910> me<00:04:41.000> wrong<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.389> don't<00:04:41.599> think<00:04:41.780> the

don't get me wrong I don't think the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.480 
don't get me wrong I don't think the

camera was always this slow I mean the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.950 
camera was always this slow I mean the
front-facing<00:04:43.789> camera<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.360> still<00:04:44.539> pretty<00:04:44.810> fast

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.839 
front-facing camera is still pretty fast
but<00:04:45.560> for<00:04:45.680> some<00:04:45.830> reason<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.130> think<00:04:46.190> I'm<00:04:46.340> able<00:04:46.610> to

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
but for some reason I think I'm able to

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.640 
but for some reason I think I'm able to
turn<00:04:47.330> off<00:04:47.449> the<00:04:47.599> HDR<00:04:47.960> mode<00:04:48.199> and<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.620> camera

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
turn off the HDR mode and the camera

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.860 
turn off the HDR mode and the camera
spends<00:04:49.250> most<00:04:49.729> of<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:49.970> time<00:04:50.000> processing<00:04:50.660> three

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
spends most of the time processing three

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.050 
spends most of the time processing three
images<00:04:51.199> every<00:04:51.590> shot<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:52.460> might<00:04:52.639> just<00:04:52.789> be<00:04:52.849> my

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
images every shot it might just be my

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.909 
images every shot it might just be my
specific<00:04:53.300> phone<00:04:53.690> but<00:04:53.930> aside<00:04:54.110> from<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.349> the

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
specific phone but aside from that the

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.740 
specific phone but aside from that the
camera<00:04:55.400> has<00:04:55.580> some<00:04:55.940> pretty<00:04:56.210> good<00:04:56.300> features

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
that comes in at 4096 by 2160 now the

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.850 
that comes in at 4096 by 2160 now the
last<00:05:19.810> thing<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.080> want<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.319> talk<00:05:20.470> about<00:05:20.590> is

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
last thing that I want to talk about is

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.920 
last thing that I want to talk about is
the<00:05:21.099> battery<00:05:21.460> life<00:05:21.520> it's<00:05:22.000> fantastic

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
the battery life it's fantastic

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.409 
the battery life it's fantastic
it<00:05:23.319> has<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.500> 3100<00:05:24.310> milliamp<00:05:24.639> hour<00:05:24.759> battery<00:05:24.879> and

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
it has a 3100 milliamp hour battery and

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.820 
it has a 3100 milliamp hour battery and
honestly<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:25.840> think<00:05:25.960> it's<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.349> longest

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
honestly I think it's the longest

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.170 
honestly I think it's the longest
lasting<00:05:27.069> battery<00:05:27.280> I've<00:05:27.789> used<00:05:28.060> on<00:05:28.150> a

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
lasting battery I've used on a

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.059

smartphone I've never ran into an
instance<00:05:30.400> where<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> felt<00:05:30.909> compromised<00:05:31.360> by<00:05:31.509> the

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
instance where I felt compromised by the

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.480 
instance where I felt compromised by the
battery<00:05:31.930> life<00:05:32.110> even<00:05:32.349> on<00:05:32.680> days<00:05:32.889> when<00:05:33.159> I<00:05:33.190> forgot

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
battery life even on days when I forgot

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.309 
battery life even on days when I forgot
to<00:05:33.639> charge<00:05:33.789> it<00:05:33.940> overnight<00:05:34.210> I<00:05:34.539> was<00:05:34.930> still<00:05:35.169> able

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
to charge it overnight I was still able

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.809 
to charge it overnight I was still able
to<00:05:35.500> get<00:05:35.620> through<00:05:35.889> most<00:05:36.099> of<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.340> second<00:05:36.699> day

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
to get through most of the second day

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.520

life<00:05:43.900> out<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:44.319> so<00:05:44.590> you<00:05:44.650> wouldn't<00:05:44.919> even

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
life out of this so you wouldn't even

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.879 
life out of this so you wouldn't even
need<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.370> switch<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.729> out<00:05:45.819> as<00:05:46.030> much<00:05:46.240> anyways<00:05:46.889> so

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
need to switch it out as much anyways so

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.040 
need to switch it out as much anyways so
is<00:05:48.039> this<00:05:48.220> really<00:05:48.639> a<00:05:48.669> flagship<00:05:49.419> killer<00:05:49.630> this<00:05:49.960> is

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
is this really a flagship killer this is

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.320 
is this really a flagship killer this is
a<00:05:50.080> device<00:05:50.409> that<00:05:50.440> never<00:05:50.889> truly<00:05:51.310> settles<00:05:51.789> well

a device that never truly settles well
some<00:05:52.509> might<00:05:52.630> argue<00:05:52.659> that<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.169> does<00:05:53.380> settle<00:05:53.650> for

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
some might argue that it does settle for

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.189 
some might argue that it does settle for
no<00:05:54.190> expandable<00:05:54.819> storage<00:05:54.909> no<00:05:55.630> removable
