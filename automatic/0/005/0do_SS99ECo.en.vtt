00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.990
 good hello to everyone in friendly fights 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.450
 welcome back in the company of war 86 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.970
 of orphan albums and also those of 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.150
 those and phone punto.it in the video of 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 today we wanted to show how to go to 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.599
 use a cable or tg for how much 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.449
 regards to connecting to 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.210
 example pennette usb in short any 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.790
 device that uses the USB interface 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.869
 with for example a nex 5 that we give 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.670
 then obviously 

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:50.979
 let's start immediately with the assumption is 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.269
 only some phones can natively 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.860
 read the usb keys directly 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.619
 through this it must be said 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.799
 as you can see on one side we have 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.780
 the male input jones me of 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.930
 on the other side the USB female input 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.650
 size so we could go to 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.090
 connect a wax directly 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.920
 you can see for later then 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.200
 enter it in the phone and you can read 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.930
 the files that are inside like 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.270
 said before only a few phones do it 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.310
 not actively others need 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.140
 certain applications as per 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.620
 example in this case nexus 5 will have to 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.909
 go and install an application that 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.510
 it's called stick mount or this is the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.080
 which precisely to be able to recognize the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.360
 viability or any USB periphery 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.100
 because obviously if we attack a 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.810
 adapter then we can read too 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.240
 microsd sd cards any kind of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.549
 periphery let's say through note 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.390
 the stick mount application what happens 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.850
 an internal folder will be emulated 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.940
 of the phone where we could go to 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.140
 find the files that will be inside 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.760
 then later we could for example 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.500
 play video songs open images 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.489
 as if they were quietly copied 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.920
 inside of 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.409
 now let's see with the stick installation 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.610
 mount if we go to connect right away 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:31.290
 will be recognized 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:38.280
 obviously see the permission of 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:41.129
 root and create sd usb card at 1 hour 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 if not we go looking for it through a 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.410
 explorer that in this case for example 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.250
 can be solid explorer 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 here it is that we are going to surf 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:04.459
 inside the phone we will look for the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:07.799
 usb usb stage folder so if you see it 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.430
 this they take we find ourselves the 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.500
 sda1 folder inside we can 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.780
 find us all the files we have put 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.010
 for example an art is the home of the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:28.980
 songs that will come 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 automatically reproduced or 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.620
 directly open images and 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.769
 ethical and all the programs in which 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.870
 we want April or even 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:45.359
 play a movie only and in this case 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.620
 so for reasons of roddick bari se 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.410
 we are going to reproduce it with the producers 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.960
 standard 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.330
 and android will not play then in 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:03.730
 this case we should install vlc 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:04.420
 player because as present in the case of 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.260
 computer 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.150
 obviously there are players who have 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.750
 determined the nodes while they are missing 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.890
 so many highs here in this case vlc is one 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.570
 of the most complete 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.410
 the comparison is obviously to that 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.320
 android standard which of course if 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.330
 we will try to open it with that 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.050
 there is immediately that the file is 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.050
 impossible to reproduce 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.090
 obviously as I said before only 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.160
 some phones do are set up to 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.620
 do shock because why like for the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.990
 case of the nexus 4 instead is not possible 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.570
 read shuttles because why 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.500
 practically does not receive the right 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.710
 power supply from the output to micro usb 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.370
 so in that case you will have to 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.590
 install another kernel or 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.820
 connect some keys they have 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.000
 star power as for example 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.250
 hard drives though perfect month 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.470
 was the video guide regarding 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.110
 precisely this cable tg cabbage you can 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.900
 quietly find on the most famous 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.419
 store and for example amazon that I put e 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.580
 what around 10 euros unless I have it 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.230
 paid so ceo god lies other 2 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.940
 EUR 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.550
 you have already understood the price of a person 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.700
 economic branch then for the job that 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.130
 place 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.020
 one of those indispensable objects yes 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.020
 a very, very useful utility 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.580
 important also because in some 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.010
 phones we also have the option of 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.550
 connect for example a mouse through 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.840
 the tc keyboard mouse cable we can 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:49.410
 put both with the cable and wireless 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.970
 just attach the adapter to the socket 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.180
 usb and that's it 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.400
 perfect then by emanuele and cars is 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.300
 really everything and we feel the next 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.300
 video review
