trying<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.450> build<00:00:20.660> a<00:00:20.750> library<00:00:20.960> that<00:00:21.439> contains

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
trying to build a library that contains

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.010 
trying to build a library that contains
all<00:00:22.610> of<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.790> grammatical<00:00:23.390> concepts<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:23.990> that

all of the grammatical concepts so that

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.229 
all of the grammatical concepts so that
students<00:00:24.500> can<00:00:24.710> use<00:00:24.950> them<00:00:25.160> at<00:00:25.369> home<00:00:25.669> to<00:00:25.970> review

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
students can use them at home to review

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.179 
students can use them at home to review
during<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:26.779> current<00:00:27.020> year<00:00:27.169> and<00:00:27.529> then<00:00:27.950> as<00:00:28.070> they

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
during the current year and then as they

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.370 
during the current year and then as they
move<00:00:28.399> forward<00:00:28.610> on<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.210> future<00:00:29.840> years<00:00:29.989> as<00:00:30.200> well

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
move forward on in future years as well

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.040 
move forward on in future years as well
as<00:00:30.500> college<00:00:30.919> she<00:00:31.220> record<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.880> lessons<00:00:32.329> using
