00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
it short I end up at almost five minutes

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.109

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
sort of so the uploading process would

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.550

not you know you just open the blade and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.629 
not you know you just open the blade and
the<00:02:40.650> back<00:02:40.799> spring<00:02:41.069> would<00:02:41.159> kind<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.340> keep<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.579> in

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
the back spring would kind of keep it in

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.220 
the back spring would kind of keep it in
place<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.030> then<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.180> would<00:02:42.299> fold<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.569> up<00:02:42.689> but

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
place and then you would fold it up but

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.530 
place and then you would fold it up but

like<00:02:57.989> slip<00:02:58.319> joints<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.799> appreciate<00:02:59.010> them

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
like slip joints I can appreciate them

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.759 
like slip joints I can appreciate them
but<00:02:59.969> I<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.090> am<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.599> fan<00:03:00.629> of<00:03:01.019> any<00:03:01.439> kind<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
locking mechanism whatsoever so this is

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.170 
locking mechanism whatsoever so this is
actually<00:03:04.980> pretty<00:03:05.129> neat<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:06.000> know<00:03:06.120> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.920 
there's no lock back I don't know what
this<00:03:08.400> design<00:03:08.669> this<00:03:08.969> lock<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.359> actually<00:03:09.689> called

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
this design this lock is actually called

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.259 
this design this lock is actually called
but<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.980> pretty<00:03:11.189> innovative<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.849> like<00:03:12.060> it

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269

but it's pretty innovative I like it
like<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.049> said<00:03:13.199> it's<00:03:13.290> kind<00:03:13.439> of<00:03:13.469> hidden<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:14.099> is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
like I said it's kind of hidden this is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.209 
like I said it's kind of hidden this is
locked<00:03:14.519> up<00:03:14.730> no<00:03:15.329> way<00:03:15.480> that's<00:03:15.689> uh<00:03:16.040> that's<00:03:17.040> not

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
locked up no way that's uh that's not

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.890 
locked up no way that's uh that's not
gonna<00:03:17.370> close<00:03:17.609> on<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.419> don't<00:03:18.599> worry<00:03:18.810> I'm

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
not going to cut myself

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.300 
not going to cut myself
then<00:03:21.959> again<00:03:22.229> you<00:03:22.409> just<00:03:22.530> push<00:03:22.829> down<00:03:22.859> in<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
then again you just push down in the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.129 
then again you just push down in the
secondary<00:03:23.729> blade<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.419> depresses<00:03:25.109> the

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
secondary blade and that depresses the

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.949 
secondary blade and that depresses the
lock<00:03:25.409> and<00:03:25.709> then<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:26.819> secondary<00:03:27.269> blade<00:03:27.599> itself

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
lock and then the secondary blade itself

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.420 
lock and then the secondary blade itself
is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:29.269> Warren<00:03:30.269> Cliff<00:03:30.509> design<00:03:31.159> so<00:03:32.159> it's<00:03:32.280> good

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
is a Warren Cliff design so it's good

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.830 
is a Warren Cliff design so it's good
you<00:03:32.519> have<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.669> small<00:03:32.909> you<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.180> small

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
you have a small you have a small

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.869 
you have a small you have a small
secondary<00:03:34.229> blade<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.579> for<00:03:35.759> certain

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
secondary blade you know for certain

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.369 
secondary blade you know for certain
cutting<00:03:36.269> tasks<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.659> this<00:03:36.780> does<00:03:36.959> not<00:03:37.169> lock

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
cutting tasks and this does not lock

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.229 
cutting tasks and this does not lock
this<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:37.889> like<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> slip<00:03:38.579> joint<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:39.000> back

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
this is just like a slip joint the back

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.199 
this is just like a slip joint the back
spring<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.379> kind<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.560> keeps<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:40.919> place

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
spring I just kind of keeps it in place
