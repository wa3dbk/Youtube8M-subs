00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.959
 for the recipe of bread pita bread kebab 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:15.100
 it will require 500 grams flour with a 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:19.930
 teaspoon salt 20 centilitres 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:23.350
 of warm water 25 g of fresh yeast a 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.780
 tablespoon of milk an attack 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.720
 yesterday at sompuis the first thing to do 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.869
 it is to dilute the yeast north a little 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 water 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.940
 then you add the rest of your 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:50.989
 then took the flour add the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.760
 milk is mixed with him as you see I 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.280
 cram here at home you have 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.550
 an electric taste I advise to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.570
 using it is much more practical 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.730
 once you're mixing well one 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.769
 will add water the glas must not 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.640
 suddenly add you so I 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.280
 do that make it so small then I 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.610
 put about half 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.009
 here and I am a mix is why 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.600
 we are not all old simply 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.030
 because the dough must have a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.250
 certain textures and that's why we 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.869
 do it cautiously and not all of a sudden 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.450
 why mess up all the preparation 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.670
 we as you see there is lack of 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.759
 the water so I add again 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.220
 half so I still have to add a 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.180
 little water to reach this texture 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.970
 must the dough 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.189
 she sticks a little but not too much and 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.230
 then we will now go to work 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.740
 for my 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.250
 10 to 15 minutes you put it on 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.600
 your work plan this is how 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.610
 and if ever it sticks a little do not hesitate 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.420
 not to put some flour and go 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.440
 perform this movement there a woman all 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.410
 and the dough well actually to allow 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.270
 she saher well here it is to write the 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.130
 paste you can do using 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.680
 machines but good as I do not have more 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.240
 they hand it goes too 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.450
 and that finds in ten minutes 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.340
 and that's after ten minutes our paw 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.170
 and take now I've affixed in 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.450
 the salad bowl we will leave opposite during 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.610
 an hour and you can resort to the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 dough using a tea towel 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.630
 while waiting for the hook I will 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.120
 advise to go watch the video of the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.210
 kebab recipe so I'm fine 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.710
 a visit you click and the recipe 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.530
 of the sauce just there we are all 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:46.690
 after an hour we discover a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.080
 dough that really swelled well is this 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.660
 we're going to do now has separated 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.620
 the dough into several small balls 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.110
 dawn which will give the kebab bread or 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.209
 pita bread itself so these parts of which 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.650
 a plate for the need one could either 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.930
 the gray and sun parchment paper 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.310
 and we will now take some dough 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.680
 and make a ball like this so that that 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.900
 really goes from the pumps of yours to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 you if you want rolls of 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 little bit that they're going to know that's okay 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.080
 inflate with his sail got up 2 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.540
 once if you want rolls 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.510
 it takes the whole holidays where you do 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.700
 a camp and you cut in half 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.680
 presences to want me I prefer them 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.680
 rolls so I make it like that 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.080
 here I put 4 by plates is 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.420
 then what you have to do is 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:46.239
 to prick the pines lightly on the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:49.720
 on it like these and then we 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.050
 not go dijonnais is also on the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:58.120
 on top of a mixture so you put a 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:01.500
 whole egg with a little bit of milk 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 better if boxing does not move 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.459
 then we'll leave it up again 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.920
 thirty minutes we see that the pines in 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.770
 well lifted before putting them in the oven or 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.090
 brush them with egg and milk 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.400
 if he could not put any 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.930
 the water simply will also go for 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.930
 cooking 180 degrees at mid-height and the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.520
 tance about 15 to 20 minutes it depends 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.850
 depending on what you want 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.740
 get 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.640
 here I go out so what we have 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.390
 after cooking a nice complexion well 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.920
 thick that are acquired in very good and 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.260
 I wanted to cut a gift you know 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.670
 that she then seized I'll go 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.080
 show a little inside so we have 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.760

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.160
 soft here is it smells good no 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.540
 it's pretty cool I will not do any 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.420
 tastings simply because 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.670

 have a quick bite at the grill so they 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.010
 have listened even more crisp or 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.630
