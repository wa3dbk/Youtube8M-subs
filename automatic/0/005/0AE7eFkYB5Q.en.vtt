when<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> saw<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.530> instantly<00:01:32.189> realized<00:01:32.549> how

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
when I saw it I instantly realized how

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
when I saw it I instantly realized how
narrow<00:01:33.030> was<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> how<00:01:33.720> long<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> how

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
narrow was and how long it was and how

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.010 
narrow was and how long it was and how
committing<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.780> even

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
committing it was because you know even

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.179 
committing it was because you know even
though<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.170> doesn't<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> ceiling<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
though it doesn't have a ceiling on it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
though it doesn't have a ceiling on it
once<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> drop<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.570> can't<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.960> out

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
once you drop into it you can't get out

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.780 
once you drop into it you can't get out
of<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> the

the<00:02:00.360> dump<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> highly<00:02:01.680> technical<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:02.250> mean<00:02:02.430> not

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the dump is highly technical I mean not

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.350 
the dump is highly technical I mean not
everybody<00:02:03.000> could<00:02:03.330> fly<00:02:03.870> that<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:05.150> flag<00:02:06.150> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
everybody could fly that that flag that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960 
everybody could fly that that flag that
he's<00:02:06.570> gonna<00:02:06.780> fly<00:02:07.020> all<00:02:07.650> depends<00:02:08.369> where<00:02:08.700> he's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
he's gonna fly all depends where he's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
gonna go inside I guess if he doesn't go

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.020 
gonna go inside I guess if he doesn't go
too<00:02:12.480> deep<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.320> long<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.740> far<00:02:14.100> he<00:02:14.820> should

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
too deep in there long as far he should

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.550 
too deep in there long as far he should
be<00:02:15.210> fine<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.020> have<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> leave<00:02:16.380> from<00:02:16.500> a

worried about like you know there's
going<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.310> verbal<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.790> both<00:02:50.970> sides<00:02:51.270> that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
going to be a verbal on both sides that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.560 
going to be a verbal on both sides that
I've<00:02:51.570> been<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.260> war<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.730> started<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
I've been in the war and I started to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.120 
I've been in the war and I started to
get<00:02:57.720> different<00:02:57.990> reflections<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.890> that

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
get different reflections that that

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.920 
get different reflections that that
might<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.730> been<00:02:59.880> even<00:03:00.150> feeling<00:03:00.420> much<00:03:00.690> more

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
might have been even feeling much more

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.600 
might have been even feeling much more
demanding<00:03:01.320> than<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.650> were<00:03:01.770> expecting<00:03:01.860> him<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
demanding than we were expecting him and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.670 
demanding than we were expecting him and
then<00:03:03.180> chip<00:03:03.390> said<00:03:03.600> yeah<00:03:03.810> I'll<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.110> fine<00:03:04.140> fine

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
then chip said yeah I'll be fine fine

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.320 
then chip said yeah I'll be fine fine
I'll<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.040> do<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.489> really<00:03:05.670> current<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.180> I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
I'll just do I get really current and I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.250 
I'll just do I get really current and I
got<00:03:06.660> worried

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
got worried

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.680 
got worried
but<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:07.980> when<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.520> showed<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.120> Warren<00:03:09.420> stud

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
but then when I showed up to Warren stud

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.840 
but then when I showed up to Warren stud
I<00:03:09.720> met<00:03:10.050> Jeff<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.350> he<00:03:10.950> was<00:03:11.100> clearly<00:03:11.400> spot-on

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
I met Jeff and he was clearly spot-on

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
I met Jeff and he was clearly spot-on
and<00:03:12.150> he<00:03:12.270> was<00:03:12.420> focused<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.590> he<00:03:13.620> was

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.100 

once<00:03:19.550> thought<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.060> not<00:03:20.240> only<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.660> crack<00:03:20.900> or

there's<00:03:23.510> another<00:03:23.750> line<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.350> turn<00:03:24.770> to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
there's another line you have to turn to

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.949 
there's another line you have to turn to
your<00:03:25.069> left<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.640> then<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.209> go<00:03:26.420> into<00:03:26.660> these

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
your left and then you go into these

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.170 
your left and then you go into these
like<00:03:27.200> other<00:03:27.470> crack<00:03:27.800> it's<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.250> long<00:03:28.640> straight

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
like other crack it's like long straight

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.210 
like other crack it's like long straight
and<00:03:29.510> narrow<00:03:29.720> place<00:03:30.590> where<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.010> basically

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
and narrow place where you basically

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.580 
and narrow place where you basically
continues<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.300> fly<00:03:32.510> under<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:32.959> three<00:03:33.350> lines

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
continues and fly under the three lines

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.230 
continues and fly under the three lines
and<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.160> was<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> really<00:03:34.580> good<00:03:34.790> practice<00:03:35.209> for

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
and it was a really good practice for

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.020 
and it was a really good practice for
Jeb<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.810> kind<00:03:36.020> of<00:03:36.110> apply<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.500> straight<00:03:37.190> line<00:03:37.459> you

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
Jeb to kind of apply a straight line you

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.030 
Jeb to kind of apply a straight line you
know<00:03:38.150> gopher<00:03:38.570> asshole<00:03:38.990> ass<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.740> and

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
know gopher asshole ass and and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.830 
know gopher asshole ass and and
establish<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> fact<00:03:41.000> that<00:03:41.090> he<00:03:41.330> can<00:03:41.540> he<00:03:41.690> can

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
establish the fact that he can he can

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.170 
establish the fact that he can he can
fly<00:03:42.080> straight<00:03:42.580> consistently<00:03:43.580> for<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.150> a

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
fly straight consistently for it for a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.750 
fly straight consistently for it for a
long<00:03:44.360> time<00:03:47.920> there's<00:03:48.920> no<00:03:49.070> question<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.580> it's

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
long time there's no question that it's

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.520 
long time there's no question that it's
about<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.180> same<00:03:50.390> narrow<00:03:50.630> as<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.320> flight

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
about the same narrow as the flight

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.370 
about the same narrow as the flight
we're<00:03:51.680> gonna<00:03:51.800> do<00:03:52.010> okay<00:03:53.030> SuperDuper<00:03:54.019> narrow

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
we're gonna do okay SuperDuper narrow

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.220 
we're gonna do okay SuperDuper narrow
and<00:03:54.590> really<00:03:55.130> really<00:03:55.280> long<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:56.780> perfect

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and really really long so it's perfect

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.590 
and really really long so it's perfect
it's<00:03:57.530> about<00:03:57.830> is<00:03:58.040> wide<00:03:58.310> you<00:03:58.640> know<00:03:59.060> about<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
it's about is wide you know about the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.630 
it's about is wide you know about the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
that the chess piece of covered this

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.790 
that the chess piece of covered this

place may be my most favorite place on
earth<00:04:54.860> but<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.880> don't<00:04:56.330> think<00:04:56.479> it<00:04:56.660> was<00:04:56.810> enough

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
earth but I don't think it was enough

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.900 
earth but I don't think it was enough
you<00:04:57.410> know<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.740> think<00:04:57.979> it's<00:04:58.340> good<00:04:58.580> that<00:04:58.610> he

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
you know I think it's good that he

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.659 
you know I think it's good that he
basically<00:04:59.120> was<00:04:59.479> flying<00:05:00.260> similar<00:05:00.979> lines<00:05:01.220> but

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
basically was flying similar lines but

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.189 
basically was flying similar lines but
he<00:05:01.850> was<00:05:02.000> not<00:05:02.150> flying<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.720> exact<00:05:03.169> line

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
he was not flying the exact line

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.769 
he was not flying the exact line
the<00:05:05.009> question<00:05:05.400> was<00:05:05.550> like<00:05:05.580> how<00:05:06.029> did<00:05:06.090> he<00:05:06.360> do<00:05:06.569> this

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
the question was like how did he do this

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.230 
the question was like how did he do this
chump<00:05:07.110> over<00:05:07.529> and<00:05:07.680> over<00:05:08.009> again<00:05:08.159> and<00:05:08.639> be

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
chump over and over again and be

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.760

contacted by this Hungarian company air
class<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:27.029> they<00:05:27.689> had<00:05:27.870> been<00:05:28.050> developing

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
class and they had been developing

class and they had been developing
augmented<00:05:29.849> reality<00:05:29.990> which<00:05:30.990> means<00:05:31.289> it's<00:05:31.499> kind

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
augmented reality which means it's kind

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.189 
augmented reality which means it's kind
of<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:31.860> like<00:05:32.009> virtual<00:05:32.580> reality<00:05:32.610> where<00:05:33.419> where

of a like virtual reality where where

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.640 
of a like virtual reality where where
they<00:05:34.740> can<00:05:34.889> create<00:05:35.069> this<00:05:35.460> kind<00:05:35.729> of<00:05:35.849> virtual

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
they can create this kind of virtual

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.129 
they can create this kind of virtual
tracks<00:05:37.650> or<00:05:38.009> whose<00:05:38.460> virtual<00:05:39.029> objects<00:05:39.810> on<00:05:39.990> the

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
tracks or whose virtual objects on the

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.760 
tracks or whose virtual objects on the
sky<00:05:40.379> with<00:05:41.009> GPS<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:42.419> we<00:05:42.569> flew<00:05:42.779> Jeff<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.319> Hungary

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
sky with GPS so we flew Jeff to Hungary

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.709 
sky with GPS so we flew Jeff to Hungary
to<00:05:43.860> test<00:05:44.279> the<00:05:44.430> augmented<00:05:44.969> reality<00:05:44.999> technology

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
to test the augmented reality technology

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.860 
to test the augmented reality technology
and<00:05:46.409> it<00:05:47.219> was<00:05:47.339> quite<00:05:47.639> interesting<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:48.210> see<00:05:48.449> so

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
and it was quite interesting to see so

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.050 
and it was quite interesting to see so
he<00:05:48.990> was<00:05:49.110> able<00:05:49.439> to<00:05:49.469> actually<00:05:49.800> fly<00:05:50.339> the<00:05:50.400> exact

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
he was able to actually fly the exact

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.579 
he was able to actually fly the exact
same<00:05:51.330> flight<00:05:51.629> so<00:05:51.839> I<00:05:51.900> guess<00:05:52.050> he's<00:05:52.199> gonna<00:05:52.289> fly

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
same flight so I guess he's gonna fly

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.459 
same flight so I guess he's gonna fly
here<00:05:52.949> in<00:05:53.099> air<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:54.300> way<00:05:54.599> of<00:05:54.810> high<00:05:55.020> above<00:05:55.319> the

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
here in air and a way of high above the

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:16.850 
here in air and a way of high above the
ground<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:55.979> they<00:05:56.099> had<00:05:56.310> no<00:05:56.520> risk<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.240> hitting<00:06:15.860> we

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
ground so they had no risk of hitting we

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.740 
ground so they had no risk of hitting we
can<00:06:17.039> utilize<00:06:17.580> as<00:06:17.789> a<00:06:17.819> practice<00:06:18.240> tool<00:06:18.449> for<00:06:18.719> our

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
can utilize as a practice tool for our

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.600 
can utilize as a practice tool for our
athletes<00:06:19.169> so<00:06:19.589> they<00:06:19.710> can<00:06:19.860> fly<00:06:19.979> these<00:06:20.129> tracks

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
athletes so they can fly these tracks

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.999 
athletes so they can fly these tracks
and<00:06:20.909> make<00:06:21.479> sure<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.960> that<00:06:22.229> they've<00:06:22.500> super

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
and make sure that that they've super

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.619 
and make sure that that they've super
current<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.520> they<00:06:23.669> know<00:06:23.849> what's<00:06:24.089> ahead<00:06:24.509> of

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
current and they know what's ahead of

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.269 
current and they know what's ahead of
them<00:06:24.870> but<00:06:25.259> also<00:06:25.469> I<00:06:25.649> think<00:06:25.740> in<00:06:26.039> the<00:06:26.099> future

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
them but also I think in the future

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.010 
them but also I think in the future
there<00:06:26.669> could<00:06:26.849> be<00:06:26.879> like<00:06:27.240> you<00:06:27.330> know<00:06:27.449> competitive

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
there could be like you know competitive

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.990 
there could be like you know competitive
league<00:06:28.229> you<00:06:28.710> know<00:06:28.740> people<00:06:29.159> can<00:06:29.370> even<00:06:29.669> race

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
league you know people can even race

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.429 
league you know people can even race
different<00:06:30.449> parts<00:06:30.689> of<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.839> world<00:06:31.050> at<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.289> same

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:31.439 
different parts of the world at the same

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.899 
different parts of the world at the same
time<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:31.979> they<00:06:32.099> can<00:06:32.279> see<00:06:32.490> these<00:06:32.639> like<00:06:32.879> you

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
time and they can see these like you

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.790 
time and they can see these like you
know<00:06:32.999> amazing<00:06:33.629> virtual<00:06:34.110> tracks<00:06:34.409> that<00:06:34.649> they

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
know amazing virtual tracks that they

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.920 
know amazing virtual tracks that they
can<00:06:34.949> fly<00:06:35.159> through<00:06:35.399> this<00:06:35.969> is<00:06:36.149> probably<00:06:36.689> gonna

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
can fly through this is probably gonna

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.110 
can fly through this is probably gonna
be<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.379> most<00:06:37.620> significant<00:06:38.430> step<00:06:38.669> we've<00:06:38.939> done

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
be the most significant step we've done

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.239 
be the most significant step we've done
for<00:06:39.389> the<00:06:39.479> future<00:06:39.689> and<00:06:40.169> for<00:06:40.199> the<00:06:40.560> future<00:06:40.649> of

for the future and for the future of

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.999 
for the future and for the future of
wingsuit<00:06:41.550> racing<00:06:42.270> and<00:06:42.810> I<00:06:43.050> feel<00:06:43.289> so<00:06:43.469> privileged

wingsuit racing and I feel so privileged

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.010 
wingsuit racing and I feel so privileged
that<00:06:44.069> I<00:06:44.550> didn't<00:06:44.909> smack<00:06:45.210> against<00:06:45.539> the<00:06:45.659> mountain

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
that I didn't smack against the mountain

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.570 
that I didn't smack against the mountain
when<00:06:46.169> I<00:06:46.199> would<00:06:46.379> face<00:06:46.560> something<00:06:46.830> 10<00:06:47.219> years<00:06:47.460> ago

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
when I would face something 10 years ago

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.389 
when I would face something 10 years ago
that<00:06:47.729> I<00:06:47.909> got<00:06:48.149> to<00:06:48.300> live<00:06:48.449> to<00:06:48.599> this<00:06:49.050> point<00:06:49.379> and<00:06:49.680> and

doing continuously throughout his career
gonna<00:07:02.219> be<00:07:02.490> creating<00:07:02.909> new<00:07:02.939> new<00:07:03.330> challenges<00:07:03.930> and

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
gonna be creating new new challenges and

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.100 
gonna be creating new new challenges and
new<00:07:04.139> boundaries<00:07:04.710> and

new boundaries and

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.930 
new boundaries and
and<00:07:05.320> overcome<00:07:05.860> them<00:07:06.340> there<00:07:06.550> will<00:07:06.670> be<00:07:06.700> the

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
and overcome them there will be the

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.420 
and overcome them there will be the
gnarliest<00:07:07.710> proximity<00:07:08.710> wingsuit<00:07:09.070> flying<00:07:09.250> I've

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
gnarliest proximity wingsuit flying I've

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.730 
gnarliest proximity wingsuit flying I've
ever<00:07:09.640> done<00:07:09.820> I<00:07:10.030> mean<00:07:10.210> it<00:07:10.360> will<00:07:10.480> be<00:07:10.650> without<00:07:11.650> a

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
ever done I mean it will be without a

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.650 
ever done I mean it will be without a
doubt<00:07:11.860> the<00:07:12.160> most<00:07:12.280> difficult<00:07:12.730> so<00:07:13.060> it's<00:07:13.540> gonna

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
doubt the most difficult so it's gonna
