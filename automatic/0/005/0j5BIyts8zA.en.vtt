00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 and well that's where the world knows where 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.089
 breathe and we meet again today 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 to innovate clash of clan today 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.029
 new rather special video is 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.560
 pretty impressive test you 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 present three attacks with goals 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.330
 unjustly staggering do not forget to 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.740
 ask a small live is always great 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.029
 fun of wildlife to reach the 400 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.800
 secular I hope we work too 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 this time the 400 m it's still 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 super fun brief little parenthesis 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.329
 among them we meet today 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 for a video as I say everything to 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.559
 the time pretty impressive 1 lo 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 three gameplay with just deloot 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.030
 incredible two come from me the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.219
 last problem comes from a youtuber 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.090
 American so here are all the links 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.950
 will be in the description given 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.270
 obviously not to say that it's 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.800
 plagiarized so today we end up 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 finally now we find ourselves for a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.840
 this first attack that started with 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 pigs and wizards the guy saw 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 that here I was with case and in fact I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.949
 just left a week 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.090
 on vacation and I did not have internet anymore 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.440
 I could not play the game plan anymore 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.320
 so here are my resources were 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 completely max but remy extractor 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 was how crowd this is the guy got 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.869
 is extremely fun 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.909
 we can say that like that he took all 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.320
 theirs simply must 700 thousand eight 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 hundred thousand gold pardons it's just a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 sick thing he also had 700000 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.229
 of elixir at his disposal 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.570
 and unfortunately could not all 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.689
 believe is not 100% but it's 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 still something sick 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.960
 then we see there a magnificent 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 attack with over 700 loot lines 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.299
 we then go with the second 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.799
 attack in this second attack 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.810
 it's just a sick thing 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.350
 since there is 800 me of chirac to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.210
 take 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.070
 four thousand five hundred black lands 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.590
 so here's the guy unfortunately does not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.119
 will not do 100% 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.530
 I do not know what nationality he 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.360
 puts them in any case it will not do the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.369
 100% he attacks fairly weak troops 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.430
 and he will not be able to but in any case will 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.440
 to be pretty good 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.730
 he's going to put himself of course that's him five 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.830
 minutes of each to take even if it does not 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.390
 do not take it all that makes a lot of 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.500
 goals a smile when we come across that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.330
 it's a sick thing 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880
 so here he is throwing a few small 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.340
 pigs in history to clear a little 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.050
 the passage for his troops et cetera he 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 will do what he can here he is going to 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.390
 untangle 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.709
 it's not a very good attack but I 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.930
 really wanted me introduced him for the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.730
 booty that was just incredible here 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.370
 the guy and it's really extremely 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.110
 alright so right now and who 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.550
 flexes I think a little bit about com they 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.380
 how is it going to unfold how he is going 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.459
 fend for it there they 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.080
 pose some pals and servants in 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.790
 water then joined ya all laid down so that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.470
 it was not very good of him that he 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.580
 will try to believe that corso this is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.989
 that he was a little panicked because he 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.489
 still wanted to take everything he 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.930
 did not know exactly where to attack by the 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.459
 up below after girl does not know 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.050
 too much clipping way you want when 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.720
 even get well recover 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.850
 starting with a lot of resources must 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.100
 also know that I was in shape 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.450
 more fit here I have flash dvt 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.560
 outside I might have had to enter hdv 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.940
 while I was on vacation 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.120
 good unfortunately it's not very serious 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.230
 there I the trophies and the resources 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.570
 have been lost good I'm still 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.860
 not bad their rise again so 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.320
 there she tries to fend 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.580
 lahonce and some little dragons for 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.090
 scrounge will take a little bit of 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.830
 resources 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.440
 he still ends up with 1,500 miles 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.160
 gold pillet which is still pretty 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 huge 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.209
 so the tax is going to finish she's going 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.570
 come to an end and he will have taken five 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.519
 one hundred thousand gold and 250000 elixir 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.110
 unfortunately he will have nothing close in 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.820
 external yeah that's really a shame 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.049
 because when you're a rush 1 he 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.959
 still a champion is enough 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.220
 important to take resources so 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.260
 it's really a shame 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.420
 for him there is only three trophies 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.549
 a 23% double star to a beautiful 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.280
 attack for it and we move everything from 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.600
 continuation for this magnificent attack so 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.980
 of m 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.080
 greg smith tlc 715 youtuber american one 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.500
 sick thing and what are you seeing 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.660
 rock it's just the sum of the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.260
 city ​​the booty we can take up to 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.840
 left of the screen the 1 million 2,2 of 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.370
 gold antam resources 1 million gold 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.500
 to take it was just a trick of 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.830
 sick 400 tell me it's still 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.640
 huge also 3000 da of black elixir 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.390
 4 million readers love me 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.590
 stammers 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.650
 it's really a sick thing a 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.370
 big big big attack 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.650
 unfortunately not too much lighthouse 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.120
 in the key but here is a huge attack 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.250
 the guy was just crowd 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.560
 elixir crowd gold so here are his reserves 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 and his mines were full 1.1 million 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.580
 it was really a sick thing 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.470
 so a big gégé pursues youtuber 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.940
 american who made this attack against 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.310
 time I remember said so leaving so 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.890
 that's really needed on this one 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.290
 with its heroes will be 50% so the 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.570
 two stars quite easily his can 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.430
 say that like that you'll see that it 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.610
 was easy enough for him he's going 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.979
 finish with one more 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.000
 eight hundred thousand I gold cross 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.620
 unfortunately our teams who have 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.990
 flew away here in nature since 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.090
 was just wrong when he 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.830
 so that's enough damage 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.419
 but that's when we come across 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.930
 attacks like that it's pretty amazing 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.580
 and just not unusual because 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.449
 this is what is really impressive I 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.699
 believe it's their body all 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.099
 just two clash flank 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.960
 superb cash players doing their 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.520
 gold strings so far because since then 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.610
 before it was possible to find the 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.949
 more but now the resources have 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.060
 been patched so here is the 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.110
 I think this record is a million 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.340
 anyway we could take a 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.050
 million two and I believe this is the 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.840
 absolute record of clash the flank so a 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.300
 big gg for this tube hours so miss t 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.710
 lc 7 which is really very very low 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.629
 on this attack 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.539
 so that's the tax is coming to an end 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:28.060
 he does it's two stars 50% and he 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.560
 will recover some resources on the 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.189
 end even if it will serve him anything 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.840
 simply because he slaughters he has his 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.729
 reservations that are crowd 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.120
 so that's a wonderful attack that 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.669
 finish with 1,800 thousand gold plunder +240 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.889
 gold thread with laly titans again there 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.599
 a big gg to him I hope this level 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.830
 you will have more of here not ask a little 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.330
 live gt1 videos on the end of 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.650
 four-axis effect always super fun 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.789
 so we find ourselves very quickly for 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.000
 next two things the world and to the 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.000
 next
