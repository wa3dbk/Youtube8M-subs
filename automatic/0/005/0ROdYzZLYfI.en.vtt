00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
version of the f-150 is a great location

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.679 
version of the f-150 is a great location
to<00:00:20.310> mount<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:20.939> some<00:00:21.119> double-sided<00:00:21.510> tape

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
to mount it I use some double-sided tape

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
to mount it I use some double-sided tape
ran<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> cord<00:00:23.100> through<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> back<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
ran the cord through the back here and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.750 
ran the cord through the back here and
plugged<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> right<00:00:25.050> into<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> LDL<00:00:26.220> port<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
plugged it right into the a LDL port you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400 
plugged it right into the a LDL port you
can<00:00:26.849> see<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.240> nice<00:00:27.960> clean<00:00:28.260> installation

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
can see that nice clean installation

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
can see that nice clean installation
only<00:00:28.980> takes<00:00:29.160> ten<00:00:29.369> minutes<00:00:29.670> no<00:00:29.849> drilling<00:00:30.150> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
only takes ten minutes no drilling so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.049 
only takes ten minutes no drilling so
once<00:00:31.769> we've<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> gage<00:00:32.340> mounted<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.940> have

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
once we've got the gage mounted I have

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.250 
once we've got the gage mounted I have
to<00:00:33.180> put<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> key<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.050> SD

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to put the key in and there is an SD

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
to put the key in and there is an SD
card<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> bottom<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.780> the

card down here at the bottom of the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
card down here at the bottom of the
gauge<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:44.129> where<00:00:44.250> you're<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
gauge and that's where you're going to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
gauge and that's where you're going to
load<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.879> tune<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.690> what's<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> happen

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
load your tune so what's going to happen

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.100 
load your tune so what's going to happen
is<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.800> remote<00:00:47.129> tuner<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> send

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is your remote tuner is going to send

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.130 
is your remote tuner is going to send
you<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> tune<00:00:49.469> file<00:00:49.800> you're<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.360> save

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you a tune file you're going to save

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.250 
you a tune file you're going to save
that<00:00:52.170> file<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.250> email<00:00:53.730> onto<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.600> SD

really quick and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:09.390> shut<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> vehicle<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.650> connects

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.630 

okay<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.070> gauge<00:01:17.310> mode

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
okay you can see now it's in gauge mode

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
okay you can see now it's in gauge mode
customize<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.869> these<00:01:19.049> gauges<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.619> showing

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
customize all these gauges it's showing

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.550 
customize all these gauges it's showing
how<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.130> actual<00:01:20.460> spark<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.060> being

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
how much actual spark I'm being

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.899

calculated engine load how much timing

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.670 
calculated engine load how much timing
retard<00:01:24.210> basically<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> shows<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
retard basically then it shows the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.230 
retard basically then it shows the
perceived<00:01:26.040> octane<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.759> fuels<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> the
