00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.020 
then I connected it just a little bit to
my<00:02:51.700> lid<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.350> with<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> elf<00:02:53.950> prism<00:02:54.880> I

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
my lid going in with the elf prism I

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.710

shadow palette this is in nude and I use

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960

I<00:03:01.030> think<00:03:01.390> your<00:03:01.540> finger<00:03:01.990> would<00:03:02.230> even<00:03:02.530> work<00:03:02.709> just

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430
