help so first thing you might want to do

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.170 
help so first thing you might want to do
is<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:59.160> incline<00:00:59.730> at<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> 3.0<00:01:01.100> 3.5<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
is start your incline at a 3.0 3.5 and a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
is start your incline at a 3.0 3.5 and a
3.5<00:01:06.710> limit<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:08.220> speed<00:01:09.049> from<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.740> work

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
3.5 limit or speed from there you work

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.929 
3.5 limit or speed from there you work
it<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:12.090> 10<00:01:12.630> minutes<00:01:13.020> straight<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
it out for about 10 minutes straight and

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.719 
it out for about 10 minutes straight and
so<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.869> fast<00:01:16.830> walk<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.400> don't

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so you just you know fast walk it don't

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.130 
so you just you know fast walk it don't
hold<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> handles<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
hold on to the handles you know the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
hold on to the handles you know the
handles<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.610> keep

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
handles that are right here just keep

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.380 
handles that are right here just keep
you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.180> walking<00:01:21.990> fast<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:23.060> however<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you know walking fast or however you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.620 
you know walking fast or however you
guys<00:01:24.540> walk<00:01:25.310> if<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.369> fast<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
guys walk if that's fast to you if it's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.359 
guys walk if that's fast to you if it's
slow<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.189> do

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
slow to you know just you know just do

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.929 
slow to you know just you know just do
it<00:01:29.549> um<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.990> from<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.040> keep

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it um and then from then on you keep

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.450 
it um and then from then on you keep
walking<00:01:33.900> adding<00:01:34.460> incline<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.600> speed<00:01:37.460> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
walking adding incline to your speed so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
walking adding incline to your speed so
the<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.939> add<00:01:39.060> inclined<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:39.840> your

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the more you add inclined the more your

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
the more you add inclined the more your
speed<00:01:40.320> goes<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.579> example<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
speed goes up so for example you have

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.280 
speed goes up so for example you have
3.5<00:01:43.049> incline<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.280> wanna<00:01:44.790> double<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
3.5 incline you wanna double it up to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.330 
3.5 incline you wanna double it up to
4.5<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.240> 4.5<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.310> much

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
4.5 so you go 4.5 and if that's too much

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.020 
4.5 so you go 4.5 and if that's too much
for<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> 4.0<00:01:52.170> um<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.340> you're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
for you then just go to 4.0 um if you're

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
for you then just go to 4.0 um if you're
walking<00:01:54.420> hour<00:01:54.659> 3.5<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.799> eight<00:01:55.979> point<00:01:56.219> six

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
walking hour 3.5 do like eight point six

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
walking hour 3.5 do like eight point six
or<00:01:56.640> three<00:01:57.149> point<00:01:57.390> seven<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.990> doubled<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
or three point seven if you doubled it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
or three point seven if you doubled it
if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.159> doubled<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> three<00:01:59.969> point

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
if you doubled it do it three point

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.719 
if you doubled it do it three point
seven<00:02:00.360> oh<00:02:00.719> yeah<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:02.040> basically<00:02:02.219> your

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
seven oh yeah so that's basically your

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.450 
seven oh yeah so that's basically your
warm-up<00:02:03.210> right<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.070> warm-up

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
warm-up right there and in that warm-up

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.730 
warm-up right there and in that warm-up
alone<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.079> might<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.350> burned

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
alone I think you might have burned

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.690 
alone I think you might have burned
almost<00:02:08.190> close<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.060> 50<00:02:09.390> calories

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
almost close to 50 calories

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.110 
almost close to 50 calories
um<00:02:10.819> from<00:02:11.690> there<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.500> keep<00:02:12.830> walking<00:02:13.129> and<00:02:13.580> as

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
um from there you keep walking and as

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.460 
um from there you keep walking and as
you<00:02:14.300> keep<00:02:14.450> walking<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.870> keep<00:02:15.110> increasing

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
you keep walking you keep increasing

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.089 
you keep walking you keep increasing
your<00:02:15.709> incline<00:02:16.129> so<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.269> it's<00:02:17.480> 4.5<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.890> can

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
your incline so if it's 4.5 you can

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.940 
your incline so if it's 4.5 you can
double<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.580> 5.5<00:02:20.150> or<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.410> can<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:21.739> all<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
double it to 5.5 or you can go all the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.390 
double it to 5.5 or you can go all the

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.680 
speed your speed increases to 4.0 and
that's<00:02:58.430> when<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:59.060> start<00:02:59.120> burning

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
that's when you really start burning

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.920 
that's when you really start burning
calories<00:02:59.870> if<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.670> have<00:03:01.910> long<00:03:02.180> legs<00:03:02.209> or<00:03:02.720> if<00:03:02.810> you

have stamina like I said before and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.039

you've ran let's say added 8.0 with no
incline<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.190> know<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.670> normal

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
incline but you you know just a normal

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.710 
incline but you you know just a normal
runner<00:03:11.299> then<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.440> pretty<00:03:12.950> much<00:03:13.160> handle<00:03:13.720> this

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
runner then I pretty much handle this

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.920 
runner then I pretty much handle this
which<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.329> 4.0<00:03:18.230> running<00:03:18.799> at<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.930> 6.5

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.729 
which is you know 4.0 running at a 6.5
so<00:03:21.650> try<00:03:22.489> doing<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:23.000> fast<00:03:23.600> walk<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.139> walk<00:03:24.680> it

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
so try doing that fast walk it walk it

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.789 
so try doing that fast walk it walk it
doesn't<00:03:25.400> really<00:03:25.519> matter<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:27.230> burn<00:03:27.500> more
