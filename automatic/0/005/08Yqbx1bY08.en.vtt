00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 to the girls how are you today 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.210
 I want to share with you this 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.930
 tiny craft that I made about 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.370
 days 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.849
 are some card holders I made several and good 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.160
 I gave them away just for that reason I made them 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.730
 to present and the truth that they are very 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.840
 practical has a compartment here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.360
 he also has another 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.400
 and everything is made with material 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:35.280
 totally recycled everything is fine 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.890
 so he did it with the harp and this one did 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.129
 using these rolls or with 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.750
 empty of the toilet paper this 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.579
 idea occurred to me because I had already 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.600
 been gathering quite a lot of these 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.239
 nice to make them a mini album yo 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.640
 I wanted to make this little mini album 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.720
 I had several then I started to line 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.910
 but I thought the well and said good the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.339
 I really do not know if this person 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.860
 he is really going to use it as a mini album 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.670
 because the photos have to reduce the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.850
 of the little ones and like I do not know I do not 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.980
 I would do it then I said I do not think I would 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.710
 serve a lot so 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.320
 I decided to do it this way because she 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.160
 I remembered that I had been asked to see 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.400
 the video of the cardboard wallet that 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.050
 I did or the tetra pak then this one 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.630
 they asked for him I would like a long time ago 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.630
 then I said better I do it like that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.790
 not then I started doing it and well there 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 I'm going to show you how I did it like that 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.130
 simple, nothing more, for example 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.680
 I did it with the dap tape with the tape 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.140
 I also made another one with the other 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.950
 paper that I had out there but that's not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.790
 you here 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.010

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.310
 min guys then there I leave you with the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.760
 first video of how to make one like this 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.770
 and then I'll do another one with more 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.910
 compartments with at least one 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.800
 more compartment here to fit 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.710
 more more extreme 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.490
 more credit cards 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.070
 that you in 3-d identification and that 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.600
 so while I'm showing you the 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.580
 video of this removes I did so there they 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.510
 I leave girls a greeting for all and we 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.800

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.800
 queens bye 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.320
 well here I have two cones of the roll of 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.480
 toilet paper are already well crushed 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.810
 we have to leave it like this for several days 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.960
 crushed with books some weight and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.060
 well this one of these we're going to do 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.180
 a line in half to be able to cut 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.969
 Over there 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.730
 and the other one will remain as well as 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:03:00.030
 it's crushed and we're going to line it up 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 inside with a decorative paper paper 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.409
 paper gift contact or what you 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.560
 are we just going to pray but first 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.359
 let's line up I'm in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.670
 I will use here this paper that has 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.500
 few dots 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.470
 you can use what you 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.230
 want and then to line it up 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.540
 inside we are going to use our rubber or 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.700
 tail and I 'm going to apply it well 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.330
 good quantity not so much but how is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.290
 paper I apply enough quantity if 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.870
 it was a thinner paper because little 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.100
 that is not necessary so much and good we go 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.100
 to stick it here 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.890
 only one like this towards the ras 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.970
 because it will not be necessary for 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.040
 will see and some like then let's cut it 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.040
 so to bend it and paste it sirte 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.240
 well once we have lined by 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.480
 inside the roll then let's paste 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.110
 that remove we cut by the part by a 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.110
 of the parties 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.000
 today we are going to hit it is with our 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.069
 hot silicone if you do not have 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.819
 good silicone can suddenly use the 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.819
 same tail 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.020
 well once stuck then what 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.020
 we will do is to cover this part 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.560
 one of the sides that is open what 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:53.000
 let's close with the paper 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.600
 and the other side we're going to leave it open 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.070
 the one that we double like that in this part and 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.150
 we protected that we are going to leave 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.030
 open well then here is lined 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.640
 I cut this bit for only 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.090
 introduce this little bit here 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.860
 we are going to hit it 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.460
 alright then what I'm going to do now 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.770
 is to take another piece of stone here as 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.710
 you know this side we're going to close 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.569
 taking advantage of the paper and this side then 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.110
 we will keep leaving it open and we will 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.640
 introduce the paper again here 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.480
 and this we are going to talk about also 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.480
 here and good I'm moving forward a little bit 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.180
 well already last in the back 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.170
 I'm going to paste here also another piece 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:52.100
 of paper and then we're going to go 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:56.290
 little bit protecting all this 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:01.250
 card holder with our packing tape 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:05.330
 our tape or forgiveness paper with paper 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.150
 contact or with any other tape 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.880
 decorative 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.340
 I'm going to use a decorative ribbon that 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.790
 It is transparent color but it also has 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:19.070
 designs so that 's going to help me 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.500
 protect it and decorate them srx 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.130
 then I'm going to remember and already 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.010
 Well, that 's your decision in 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.529
 this way we still need to be a 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.549
 bit 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.549
 if it's all 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.020
 look girls then that's how it is 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.880
 the truth that has been very beautiful very 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.150
 simple to do and especially that 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.510
 It has a very good finish because everything 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.420
 it's like that I previously good 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.840
 first thing I did because it was yes a 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.530
 little good with a liner first for 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:05.630
 separated you see the union here is 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.670
 also and so but then I improve it and 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.030
 I 've already been doing this 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.030
 way
