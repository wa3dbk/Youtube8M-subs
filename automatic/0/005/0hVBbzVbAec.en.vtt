00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.969 
you go to the wallpaper and here the
motion<00:01:42.659> effect<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.439> disable<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
motion effect you can just disable it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.080 
motion effect you can just disable it
now<00:01:44.270> if<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.140> move<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:47.130> does<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.610> wobble

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
now if you just move it does not wobble

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
now if you just move it does not wobble
so<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.200> thing<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.500> I've<00:01:49.590> noticed<00:01:49.619> in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
so that's one thing that I've noticed in

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.630 
so that's one thing that I've noticed in
