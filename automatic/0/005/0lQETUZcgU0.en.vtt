me<00:00:14.130> right<00:00:14.250> an<00:00:14.549> acog<00:00:15.089> or<00:00:15.990> cycle<00:00:16.590> yeah<00:00:16.770> an<00:00:16.949> mp5

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
me right an acog or cycle yeah an mp5

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.140 
me right an acog or cycle yeah an mp5
ACOG<00:00:17.699> Moab<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.330> mean<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.310> ammo<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.640> an<00:00:20.789> mp5

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ACOG Moab I mean and ammo up with an mp5

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670 
ACOG Moab I mean and ammo up with an mp5
loans<00:00:21.480> fairly<00:00:21.869> impressive<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
loans fairly impressive but with the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.200 
loans fairly impressive but with the
ACOG<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.460> even<00:00:23.640> better<00:00:23.789> just

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
ACOG I think it's even better just

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.099 
ACOG I think it's even better just
because<00:00:24.680> I<00:00:25.680> guess<00:00:26.310> we'll<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.900> give<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> guys

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
because I guess we'll just give you guys

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.500 
because I guess we'll just give you guys
a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.289> insight<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.070> ACOG

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
a little insight about the ACOG

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.200 
a little insight about the ACOG
attachment<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.170> actually<00:00:32.040> increases<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
attachment it actually increases the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.260 
attachment it actually increases the
recoil<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> mean<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.670> sure<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.090> guys<00:00:36.210> know

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
recoil so I mean I'm sure you guys know

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
recoil so I mean I'm sure you guys know
or<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.590> guys<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
or I'm sure as you guys know that the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
or I'm sure as you guys know that the
ACOG<00:00:38.850> does<00:00:39.090> increase<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.629> gym<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.739> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
ACOG does increase your gym I think it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
ACOG does increase your gym I think it's
by<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.160> 2.5<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:41.760> something<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.390> or

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
by like 2.5 or something like that or

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.209 
by like 2.5 or something like that or
one<00:00:42.870> point<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> don't<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.829> something

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
one point I don't know it's something

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.709 
one point I don't know it's something
more<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.030> lot<00:00:45.149> more<00:00:45.180> than<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.600> red

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
more it's it's a lot more than the red

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
more it's it's a lot more than the red
dots<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> mini<00:00:47.430> scope

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
dots so it's kind of like a mini scope

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930 
dots so it's kind of like a mini scope
so<00:00:48.480> since<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> zoomed<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> recoil

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so since it zoomed in that the recoil

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
so since it zoomed in that the recoil
should<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.570> bit<00:00:51.750> more<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
should look a little bit more or it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.139 
should look a little bit more or it
should<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.550> greater<00:00:53.789> just

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
should look a little bit greater just

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
should look a little bit greater just
because<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.750> zoomed<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.430> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
because it you're zoomed in more but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.750 
because it you're zoomed in more but
they<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.180> added<00:00:57.570> even<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.530> recoil<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
they actually added even more recoil to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.119 
they actually added even more recoil to
what<00:00:59.940> they're<00:01:00.090> already<00:01:00.239> should<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
what they're already should be so I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
what they're already should be so I
don't<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:02.850> why<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.149> did<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.719> really

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
don't know why they did that it really

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570 
don't know why they did that it really
just<00:01:04.080> trans<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> dog<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> piece<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> shit

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
just trans a dog into a piece of shit

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.000 
just trans a dog into a piece of shit
attachment<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.869> um<00:01:07.110> yeah<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
attachment but um yeah so and think this

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
attachment but um yeah so and think this
is<00:01:11.159> actually<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> world<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:12.360> went<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.750> to

is actually a world first i went on to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.210 
is actually a world first i went on to

ACOG<00:01:49.829> Moab<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.520> didn't<00:01:50.670> find<00:01:50.850> them

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the corner and got that guy but that's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.010 
the corner and got that guy but that's
actually<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.500> pretty<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.060> useful<00:02:06.060> tip<00:02:06.360> if

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
actually a pretty good a useful tip if

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.419 
actually a pretty good a useful tip if
you<00:02:07.170> jump<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.560> people<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.190> does

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
you jump in people it really does

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.949 
you jump in people it really does
intimidate<00:02:08.940> them<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.239> also<00:02:09.360> makes<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> lot

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
intimidate them and also makes you a lot

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.660 
intimidate them and also makes you a lot
harder<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.349> shoot<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.280> you're

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
harder to shoot just because you're

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.090 
harder to shoot just because you're
moving<00:02:12.000> through<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.239> air<00:02:12.420> really

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
moving through the air really

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.120 
moving through the air really
so<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.880> put<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.990> good<00:02:15.020> use<00:02:15.230> guys<00:02:15.500> jump<00:02:15.950> in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
so I put that to good use guys jump in

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.180 
so I put that to good use guys jump in
at<00:02:16.490> your<00:02:16.580> enemy<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.810> then<00:02:18.020> right<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.590> saw

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
at your enemy and then right here I saw

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.530 
at your enemy and then right here I saw
a<00:02:19.220> tactical<00:02:19.700> insertion<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.330> was<00:02:20.450> just

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
a tactical insertion so I was just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.120 
a tactical insertion so I was just
waiting<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.080> completely<00:02:21.470> failed<00:02:21.830> and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
waiting but I completely failed and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.100 
waiting but I completely failed and
didn't<00:02:22.790> see<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:22.940> he<00:02:23.330> spawned<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.840> ran<00:02:23.990> away

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
didn't see that he spawned and ran away

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.930 
didn't see that he spawned and ran away
and<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.950> actually<00:02:25.130> didn't<00:02:25.460> know<00:02:25.550> what<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.760> went

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and I actually didn't know what I went

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.490 
and I actually didn't know what I went
back<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.330> theatre<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.660> he<00:02:27.020> actually<00:02:27.140> ran<00:02:27.320> up

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
back in theatre and he actually ran up

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.990 
back in theatre and he actually ran up
the<00:02:27.650> creek<00:02:27.890> he<00:02:28.100> jumped<00:02:28.370> off<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> bridge<00:02:28.670> ring

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000

got<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.940> Moab<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.210> second<00:03:26.570> ago<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:26.930> called

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
got the Moab a second ago and I called

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110 
got the Moab a second ago and I called
it<00:03:27.290> in<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.620> then<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.310> got<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:28.670> guy<00:03:28.850> right<00:03:29.060> here

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
it in and then I got this guy right here

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.000 
it in and then I got this guy right here
at<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.660> last<00:03:29.870> second<00:03:30.230> right<00:03:30.380> before<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.740> Moab

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
at the last second right before the Moab

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.850 
at the last second right before the Moab
blew<00:03:31.220> up<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.940> was<00:03:32.030> pretty<00:03:32.150> cool<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:33.290> yeah

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
blew up so that was pretty cool but yeah

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.740 
blew up so that was pretty cool but yeah
I<00:03:34.100> think<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.670> got<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> Moab<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:35.330> like<00:03:35.450> three

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
I think I got the Moab in like three

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.940 
I think I got the Moab in like three
minutes<00:03:35.930> or<00:03:36.170> something<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.680> was<00:03:36.770> pretty

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
minutes or something so it was pretty

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.920 
minutes or something so it was pretty
fast<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:37.670> anyway<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.540> looks<00:03:38.600> like<00:03:38.840> this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
fast but anyway it looks like this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.290 
fast but anyway it looks like this
