00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good guys what are you like 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.749
 Welcome back to the channel 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.520
 welcome to the first video analyzing 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:10.350
 in depth each of the 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.900
 different aspects that were shown 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.600
 yesterday at the multiplayer conference 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 of call of duty advanced warfare and in 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.859
 first of all yesterday I went up the analysis of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.259
 multiplayer styler with which we 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.820
 we can get an idea of where they are going 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.730
 the shots never better said in this 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.499
 game and then now the analyzes begin 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.880
 as well explain us in this video that 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.989
 you are seeing it on the screen you can 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 click also you have it in the 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.850
 description as explain then now 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.670
 We go step by step analyzing each 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 little game modes weapons accessories 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.140
 blah blah blah in this first video we are going to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.609
 talk about the access weapons in the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.219
 accessories that have been allowed to see that 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.199
 we have been able to see and also a very 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.090
 curious about this totally new game and 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.010
 very important that I will explain it at the end 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.019
 of the video and that has quite a relationship 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 with the weapons that are the supplies 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.859
 how good was the trailer in 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 English with the name of its liter that 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.429
 you remember at the end of the trailer it 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.050
 I opened one even when I was halfway 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.450
 of the trailer as below in the part 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.649
 bottom of the screen put 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.090
 I was playing time on my sights 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.100
 laser on a map that I do not remember the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 jail I think it 's could receive a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.969
 package of a supply that is called in 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 Spanish so well I do not roll more 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.710
 you will see it much clearer in this 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.570
 video and we go with it very well then for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.780
 start let's see the weapons there 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 in this beta we have the vall 27 the hbr a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.659
 3 and the I resent bursts only the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 nr now you are going to see what good first of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.780
 everything is a fan that I told you about every weapon 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.579
 simply good are normal weapons 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 assault rifles on the rifles we have 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.319
 the caev e5 asm and 1 and sn 6 which is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 sniper blasts is just 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.950
 we have on Tuesday how good it looked very 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.959
 well the trailer and notice that it is a 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670
 Bolt sniper always 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.069
 has a bullet ie every time 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.149
 check the bolt that loads a bullet 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.759
 ballet 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.069
 let's say that good does not take too long and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.319
 It also makes a pretty cool effect 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.299
 but calm because this does not mean 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.069
 let's see only one sniper in 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.509
 this game is worth but I thought it was good 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.310
 curious about that he always had 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.439
 a bullet after shotguns also from 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.880
 primary we have for example the pac 19 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.829
 that also looked very good at the beginning 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.420
 of the trailer as it bursts through here and 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.090
 skidding and hitting 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 and hit das and then we have the class 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.260
 new that we already talked about in some 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.920
 videos that are the heavy weapons I'm going 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.989
 to show the two the m1 is the laser weapon 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.910
 that good looked very good in this in 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.980
 this bit of here as good in the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.379
 prison map 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.760
 bust them all and then another 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.330
 side we have in the same category of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.879
 arms the x m &amp; g that is a kind of 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.739
 heavy weapons go dual goes this is not 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.900
 no streak is like that you get the equipment 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.400
 I suppose it will be quite limited what 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.140
 which is the speed of the player but 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.580
 well, that's practically what happens 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.769
 is that we do not have any gameplay either 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.690
 then from secondary schools we have the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.730
 pistols lat 45 and rw 1 the rw 1 is 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.099
 this curious weapon that we saw that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.659
 he killed a peo he just had a bullet 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.030
 but good killed a shot here I'm going 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.190
 to put the clip of the tsunami map or 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.109
 Well this paste seems a tad punch 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.519
 that your forearm falls on the truth and 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.959
 here you see how the gun has killed a shot 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.660
 and every time he throws the shot he has 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.019
 to recharge and then we needed to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.549
 rocket launcher Mr. stinger m 7 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.780
 the most important thing guys is that you do not 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.489
 you are left with the idea that you are going to see a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.140
 shotgun that there's going to be a sniper 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.480
 this is a beta and that's a game 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.310
 incomplete for example here in the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.379
 assault rifles in this single image and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.170
 we can see that here is included the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.370
 here 12 the erre x 160 or not 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.440
 worry because there will be many more 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.630
 weapons we go to the accessories where 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.820
 we have the look 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.500
 a look pretty weird that good 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.180
 and when the enemy is standing makes 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.920
 like a zoom so you can kill him 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.990
 better then on the other hand we have the 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.020
 double chargers to whites one there 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.750
 in the year 2000 54 stuck with a ribbon 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.770
 we have the grip the grenade launcher 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.110
 the laser sight is what I think is the 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.340
 unsheathed this is the butt then 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.020
 we have this accessory that is the most 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.060
 curious of all it turns out that he lives when 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.040
 equip sixth to the weapon you can see in the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.170
 minimum for people who shoot with 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.180
 muffler let's say it's a way by 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.130
 in order to counteract the silencer 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.780
 well we have red dot sight 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.330
 futuristic but we go for a lifetime 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.130
 silencer this good look is like 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.840
 a kind of thermal sight of sant the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.120
 enemies in red and here we have the look 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.860
 thermal itself we have this accessory 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.240
 also very very useful as 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.610
 recognition but modern warfare 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.950
 test an enemy that is touched you 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.400
 mark on the minimap and then finally 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.870
 we have the typical hybrid look vale 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.460
 if we go to high schools for 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.990
 example the guns we can see 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.360
 practically the same accessories but 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.210
 good is added the long cannon the dual 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.130
 the tactical knife in principle that 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.500
 we have not been able to see the accessories either 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.539
 of heavy weapons and here also because 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.669
 I show you weapons that we have not seen as 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.800
 this shotgun that is the s12 and has not been 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.780
 could see where the crossbow is in 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.090
 these weapons that I have shown you what 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.400
 I go is that it is a beta and obviously 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.009
 all the weapons are not there then there will be 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.800
 many more weapons but good we arrived 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.970
 to the final part of this video where I'm going 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.410
 to explain what the hell they are doing 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.060
 supplies well I'll try to explain 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.160
 in the best way because it's one thing 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.430
 pretty new and new things to 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.100
 Sometimes they cost you to understand them and 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.699
 in which are the supplies are a series 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.979
 of random packs that are giving you 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.120
 make challenges win experience is 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.280
 say play the game in general 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.410
 they can also give you to pass the 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.060
 campaign for everything practically everything you 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.250
 you are unlocking there that kind of 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.349
 packages of supplies the thing is that 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.610
 well you go to your menu you open them and 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.300
 it turns out that they can 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.189
 from one to three articles but what 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.469
 type of items they can touch three 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:48.020
 different things the first are things 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.759
 to customize your vest player 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.960
 sex suits helmets gloves pants 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.189
 practically everything anyway in 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.289
 another video I will explain how the 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.330
 customization of this game then 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.919
 they can also touch bonuses for 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.659
 the games for example like the one that 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.159
 showed here at the end of the trailer that a 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.889
 2 minutes to start the game 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.770
 magically have a package that 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.659
 will contain a low value streak and here 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.969
 comes the most interesting guys and for 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.599
 what have I gotten with the weapons also 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.250
 can play models of weapons and 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.139
 means this well with models of 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.870
 weapons I mean the weapons that I have 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.370
 taught before as for example the here 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.560
 12 which is what I remember although not 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.199
 be in this beta but good to imagine you 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.870
 that we have the ca 12 because we can 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.000
 to touch maybe that here 12 but that to 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.319
 the best place here 12 and another name and 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.139
 it turns out that it goes with an accessory 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.819
 incorporated that increases the damage that 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.279
 it removes precision that is to say they are weapons 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.270
 different models from all areas in that 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:46.640
 image that you are seeing 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.200
 It looks perfectly like this rifle 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.630
 assault in this case because it has several 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.490
 models with different names already what 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.370
 better then they can go with accessories 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.840
 equipped with camouflages and so on 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.730
 interesting of all is that good this already 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.500
 it's luck but the things that touch you 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.380
 in the package especially the models of 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.810
 armand are sorted by three levels of 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.960
 rarity being the first to list 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.570
 then professional and elite being elite 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.150
 the weirdest thing I'm lucky to imagine that 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.580
 you open the package and you have to go to here 12 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.050
 with him and you're worth it because that would be enough 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.880
 weird and normally as you play in the 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.980
 beats and then they also wear camouflage 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.330
 pretty weird the thing that I have is if 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.580
 the camouflages will be able to get 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.350
 in this game the way so good that 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.030
 we have habitual meeting challenges 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.770
 but also that you know that with the 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.990
 supplies also give you weapons 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.150
 different models and also with 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.370
 camouflages well guys I hope that 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.960
 you have understood it perfectly 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.180
 soon many more videos to create 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.610
 classes spurts advantages game modes 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.439
 maps and nothing else 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.439
 this afternoon like much goodbye
