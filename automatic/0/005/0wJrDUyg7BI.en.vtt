 if your problems fail 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.870
 I suggest the following to delete all folders and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.119
 all files except abs style 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.790
 Milk users and the proposal itself is stylish 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.810
 that everything will remain in place with you 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.580
