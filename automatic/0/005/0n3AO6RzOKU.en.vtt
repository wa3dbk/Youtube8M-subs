not work correctly wipe with a clean

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.880

tissue<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.300> let's<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.170> gonna<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:19.390 

I'm<00:01:07.890> gonna<00:01:08.280> line<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.970> lips<00:01:09.240> first

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.429 

the<00:01:20.400> tip<00:01:20.790> feels<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.750> dry<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.080> I'm

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the tip feels a little bit dry so I'm

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:56.289 
the tip feels a little bit dry so I'm
using<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> side<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.600 

so<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.869> how<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> looks<00:01:58.409> when<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.830> on<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so this is how it looks when it's on it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.039 
so this is how it looks when it's on it
looks<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.630> quite<00:02:00.810> precise<00:02:01.170> color<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
looks like it's quite precise color and

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.270 
looks like it's quite precise color and
yeah<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.320> tip<00:02:04.560> didn't<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.100> work<00:02:05.250> very

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
yeah the tip didn't really work very

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.100 
yeah the tip didn't really work very
well<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> use<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.330> side<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.900> tip

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
well so how to use the side of the tip

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
well so how to use the side of the tip
you<00:02:07.650> would<00:02:07.799> assume<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.819> bow<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
you would assume that you would bow to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.050 
you would assume that you would bow to
use<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> tip<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.920> liner<00:02:11.370> because

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
use right the tip of the liner because

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
use right the tip of the liner because
it<00:02:12.420> looks<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.630> it's<00:02:12.840> meant<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> foul

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it looks like it's meant to be a foul

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.710 
it looks like it's meant to be a foul
tip<00:02:13.470> licked<00:02:14.010> him<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:15.030> I'm<00:02:15.090> going<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> zoom<00:02:15.569> in

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
tip licked him so I'm going to zoom in

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780 
tip licked him so I'm going to zoom in
so<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> looks<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.040> so

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
so you can see what it looks like so

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790 
so you can see what it looks like so
this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.720> looks<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.440> don't<00:02:19.500> know

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
this is what it looks like I don't know

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.830 
this is what it looks like I don't know
if<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.300> doesn't<00:02:21.540> look<00:02:21.810> like

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
if you can see that it doesn't look like

if you can see that it doesn't look like
all<00:02:22.530> over<00:02:23.489> color<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.000> looks<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.569> has<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
all over color it looks like it has a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.250 
all over color it looks like it has a
few<00:02:25.170> bits<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:27.120> inside<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.230> the

few bits on the inside and on the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.610 
few bits on the inside and on the
outside<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.769> hasn't<00:02:29.130> fully<00:02:29.459> worked<00:02:30.350> but<00:02:31.350> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
outside that hasn't fully worked but it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.820

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
lighter than this does it also says that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.040 
lighter than this does it also says that
you<00:02:45.120> need<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.390> wait<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.840> dry<00:02:46.019> before

you can put the lip balm on so I'm

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.210

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
assuming it's probably dried by now

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.890 
assuming it's probably dried by now
because<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.549> been<00:02:50.670> about<00:02:50.819> 2<00:02:51.060> minutes<00:02:51.090> so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
because it's been about 2 minutes so

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
done okay literally looks exactly the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.660 
done okay literally looks exactly the
same<00:03:56.080> as<00:03:56.320> when<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.590> put<00:03:56.860> on<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.190> put<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.370> balm

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
same as when I put on and put the balm

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.210 
same as when I put on and put the balm
over<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.210> so<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.750> am<00:03:59.020> impressed<00:03:59.530> they<00:03:59.920> have

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
over it so I am impressed they have

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.100 
over it so I am impressed they have
stayed<00:04:00.490> on<00:04:00.520> all<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:01.030> time<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:01.510> think<00:04:01.840> that's

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
stayed on all this time I think that's

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.930 
stayed on all this time I think that's
from<00:04:02.290> really<00:04:02.560> well<00:04:02.740> I<00:04:02.950> do<00:04:03.190> think<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.820> is

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
from really well I do think that it is

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.000 
from really well I do think that it is
quite<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.270> good<00:04:04.330> idea<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.110> balm<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:05.770> one

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
quite a good idea to have balm on one

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.310 
quite a good idea to have balm on one
end<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.700> have<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.600> lip<00:04:07.780> pen<00:04:08.020> on<00:04:08.200> the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
end and then have the lip pen on the

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.440 
end and then have the lip pen on the
other<00:04:08.590> end<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:09.130> negatives<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:09.940> would<00:04:10.240> say

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
other end the negatives that I would say

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.800 
other end the negatives that I would say
is<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.080> balm<00:04:11.290> seems<00:04:11.650> quite<00:04:12.570> solid<00:04:13.570> it

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
is that the balm seems quite solid it

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.510 
is that the balm seems quite solid it
doesn't<00:04:13.840> seem<00:04:14.320> like<00:04:14.470> it's<00:04:14.710> like<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> normal<00:04:15.340> lip

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
doesn't seem like it's like a normal lip

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.699 
doesn't seem like it's like a normal lip
balm<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:15.760> flows<00:04:16.239> easily<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:16.900> your<00:04:17.080> lips<00:04:17.320> it

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
balm that flows easily on your lips it

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.800 
balm that flows easily on your lips it
doesn't<00:04:17.739> really<00:04:18.310> like<00:04:18.489> irritate<00:04:18.970> this<00:04:19.209> this

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
doesn't really like irritate this this

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.100 
doesn't really like irritate this this
seems<00:04:20.080> like<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.620> completely<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.940> hard<00:04:22.570> on<00:04:22.900> your

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
seems like it completely is hard on your

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.450 
seems like it completely is hard on your
lips<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.590> have<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.860> keep<00:04:24.040> moving<00:04:24.400> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
lips and you have to keep moving it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.250 
lips and you have to keep moving it
around<00:04:24.550> for<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.060> get<00:04:25.150> any<00:04:25.360> softer<00:04:25.840> so

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
around for it to get any softer so

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.960 
around for it to get any softer so
that's<00:04:26.440> sort<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.800> negative<00:04:26.980> but<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.790> good

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
that's sort of a negative but the good

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.910 
that's sort of a negative but the good
thing<00:04:28.150> about<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.660> bomb<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:29.200> they<00:04:29.500> actually

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
thing about the bomb is they actually

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.800 
thing about the bomb is they actually
does<00:04:30.160> feel<00:04:30.670> like<00:04:30.700> it's<00:04:30.970> moisturizing<00:04:31.510> my<00:04:31.600> lips

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
does feel like it's moisturizing my lips

does feel like it's moisturizing my lips
my<00:04:31.960> lips<00:04:32.140> do<00:04:32.350> not<00:04:32.380> feel<00:04:32.830> like<00:04:32.860> they're<00:04:33.160> dry

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
my lips do not feel like they're dry

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.060 
my lips do not feel like they're dry
they<00:04:34.120> don't<00:04:34.390> feel<00:04:34.630> like<00:04:34.870> they're<00:04:35.230> irritated

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
they don't feel like they're irritated

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.400 
they don't feel like they're irritated
they<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.520> feel<00:04:36.730> so<00:04:36.970> nice<00:04:37.240> they<00:04:37.720> look<00:04:37.750> pretty

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410

they just feel so nice they look pretty
good<00:04:38.560> as<00:04:38.860> well<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.700> like<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.180> color<00:04:40.420> as

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
good as well and I like the color as

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.020 
good as well and I like the color as
well<00:04:40.690> it's<00:04:41.020> it's<00:04:41.380> really<00:04:41.620> good<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.130> top<00:04:42.610> of<00:04:42.880> it

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
well it's it's really good the top of it

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.720 
well it's it's really good the top of it
didn't<00:04:43.480> actually<00:04:43.660> work<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.920> tip<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.550> felt

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
didn't actually work the tip of the felt

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.610 
didn't actually work the tip of the felt
it<00:04:45.940> did<00:04:46.360> not<00:04:46.570> go<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.750> my<00:04:46.960> lips<00:04:47.170> like<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:47.440> should

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
it did not go on my lips like it should

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.620 
it did not go on my lips like it should
have<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.920> was<00:04:48.070> very<00:04:48.310> very<00:04:48.490> dry<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.360> had<00:04:49.510> to

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
have it was very very dry so I had to

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.470 
have it was very very dry so I had to
end<00:04:49.780> up<00:04:49.900> using<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.500> side<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.940> fall<00:04:52.240> tip

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
end up using the side of the fall tip

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.840 
end up using the side of the fall tip
and<00:04:52.780> that's<00:04:53.560> good<00:04:53.950> but<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.310> thing<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.520> you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
and that's good but the thing is you

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.370 
and that's good but the thing is you
want<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.060> use<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.390> tip<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.630> try<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.050> use<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.320> as

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
want to use the tip to try and use it as

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.830 
want to use the tip to try and use it as
a<00:04:56.410> lip<00:04:56.710> liner<00:04:56.890> first<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.850> then<00:04:58.210> use<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.630> side

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
a lip liner first and then use the side

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.630 
a lip liner first and then use the side
of<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.290> make<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.650> like<00:04:59.800> it's<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.100> proper<00:05:00.430> lip

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
of it to make it like it's a proper lip

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.280 
of it to make it like it's a proper lip
stain<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.120> that's<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.540> negative<00:05:01.690> thing<00:05:02.110> about

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
stain so that's a negative thing about

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.800 
stain so that's a negative thing about
the<00:05:02.560> tip<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:03.340> good<00:05:03.640> thing<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.600> color

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
the tip the good thing is that the color

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.490 
the tip the good thing is that the color
is<00:05:05.310> pretty<00:05:06.310> cool<00:05:06.730> it's<00:05:07.030> pretty<00:05:07.300> true<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.080> color

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
is pretty cool it's pretty true to color

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.830 
is pretty cool it's pretty true to color
it's<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.550> little<00:05:09.580> tiny<00:05:10.000> bit<00:05:10.180> different<00:05:10.390> to<00:05:10.720> the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
it's a little tiny bit different to the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.690 
it's a little tiny bit different to the
packaging<00:05:11.290> oh<00:05:11.440> do<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:11.919> think<00:05:12.130> this<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.400> really

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
packaging oh do you think this is really

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.180 
packaging oh do you think this is really
good<00:05:12.880> I<00:05:13.180> think<00:05:13.900> it's<00:05:14.110> very<00:05:14.320> handy<00:05:14.890> and<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.070> can

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
good I think it's very handy and you can

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.980 
good I think it's very handy and you can
easily<00:05:15.370> put<00:05:15.640> in<00:05:15.790> your<00:05:15.910> bag<00:05:16.090> as<00:05:16.330> well<00:05:16.510> like<00:05:16.720> you

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
easily put in your bag as well like you

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.450 
easily put in your bag as well like you
have<00:05:17.140> to<00:05:17.260> make<00:05:17.380> sure<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.650> both<00:05:17.830> ends<00:05:18.130> click

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
have to make sure that both ends click

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.280 
have to make sure that both ends click
before<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.180> know<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:19.660> secure<00:05:19.810> so

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
before you know that it's secure so

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.930 
before you know that it's secure so
they're<00:05:20.440> very<00:05:20.620> easy<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:21.130> put<00:05:21.280> in<00:05:21.370> your<00:05:21.460> bag<00:05:21.700> and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
they're very easy to put in your bag and

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.550 
they're very easy to put in your bag and
they<00:05:22.270> won't<00:05:22.480> go<00:05:22.600> everywhere<00:05:22.930> because<00:05:23.260> as<00:05:23.440> long

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
they won't go everywhere because as long

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.830 
they won't go everywhere because as long
as<00:05:23.620> you<00:05:23.830> click<00:05:24.010> it<00:05:24.190> into<00:05:24.280> place<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.940> will<00:05:25.630> not

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
as you click it into place it will not

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.720 
as you click it into place it will not
go<00:05:26.169> everywhere<00:05:26.560> your<00:05:26.800> lid<00:05:27.010> will<00:05:27.160> not<00:05:27.340> come<00:05:27.580> off

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
go everywhere your lid will not come off

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.270 
go everywhere your lid will not come off
and<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.810> think<00:05:29.020> it's<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.500> very<00:05:29.620> handy<00:05:30.040> thing<00:05:30.220> to

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
and I think it's a very handy thing to

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.390 
and I think it's a very handy thing to
have<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.940> bomb<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.480> staying<00:05:32.020> in<00:05:32.290> one<00:05:32.890> little

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
have the bomb and staying in one little

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.950 
have the bomb and staying in one little
pen<00:05:33.669> I<00:05:33.850> think<00:05:34.060> that's<00:05:34.210> very<00:05:34.270> good<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:34.840> the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
pen I think that's very good so the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.480 
pen I think that's very good so the
negatives<00:05:35.350> about<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.710> color<00:05:35.950> is<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.430> I

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
negatives about the color is that I

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.400 
negatives about the color is that I
don't<00:05:36.550> think<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.030> goes<00:05:37.240> on<00:05:37.419> very<00:05:37.450> very<00:05:37.750> well<00:05:38.140> I

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
don't think it goes on very very well I

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.530 
don't think it goes on very very well I
think<00:05:39.040> that<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.310> does<00:05:39.490> tend<00:05:39.730> to<00:05:39.820> go<00:05:40.000> outside<00:05:40.180> of

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
think that it does tend to go outside of

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.210 
think that it does tend to go outside of
the<00:05:40.600> lines<00:05:40.870> also<00:05:41.200> with<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.500> tip<00:05:41.680> being<00:05:41.980> dry

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
the lines also with the tip being dry

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.740 
the lines also with the tip being dry
that's<00:05:42.490> not<00:05:42.610> very<00:05:42.820> good<00:05:43.030> even<00:05:43.270> though<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.600> does

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
that's not very good even though it does

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.200 
that's not very good even though it does
say<00:05:43.960> if<00:05:44.140> tip<00:05:44.410> does<00:05:44.590> not<00:05:44.710> work<00:05:44.890> correctly<00:05:45.250> wipe

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
say if tip does not work correctly wipe

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.990 
say if tip does not work correctly wipe
with<00:05:46.479> a<00:05:46.510> clean<00:05:46.810> dry<00:05:47.470> tissue<00:05:47.919> I<00:05:48.310> didn't<00:05:48.820> try

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
with a clean dry tissue I didn't try

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.510 
with a clean dry tissue I didn't try
that<00:05:49.030> out

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
that out

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.890 
that out
maybe<00:05:49.729> it<00:05:49.940> might<00:05:50.120> work<00:05:50.330> but<00:05:50.389> the<00:05:50.690> fact<00:05:50.870> that

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
maybe it might work but the fact that

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.110 
maybe it might work but the fact that
I've<00:05:51.050> never<00:05:51.080> used<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:51.620> before<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.849> tip

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
I've never used this before and the tip

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.839 
I've never used this before and the tip
has<00:05:53.360> ended<00:05:53.750> up<00:05:53.840> being<00:05:53.900> a<00:05:54.319> little<00:05:54.740> bit<00:05:54.919> dry<00:05:55.430> and

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
has ended up being a little bit dry and

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.490 
has ended up being a little bit dry and
not<00:05:56.030> properly<00:05:56.509> worked<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:56.990> don't<00:05:57.020> think<00:05:57.410> that

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
not properly worked I don't think that

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.770 
not properly worked I don't think that
that's<00:05:57.650> to<00:05:58.460> be<00:05:58.580> honest<00:05:58.819> that<00:05:59.060> good

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
that's to be honest that good

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.330 
that's to be honest that good
I<00:05:59.810> think<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.229> bomber<00:06:00.440> is<00:06:00.680> very<00:06:00.860> good<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.159> does

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
I think the bomber is very good it does

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.890 
I think the bomber is very good it does
feel<00:06:01.520> like<00:06:01.639> it's<00:06:01.849> more<00:06:01.970> stress<00:06:02.210> on<00:06:02.330> my<00:06:02.419> lips<00:06:02.690> I

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
feel like it's more stress on my lips I

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.990 
feel like it's more stress on my lips I
do<00:06:02.960> like<00:06:03.319> it<00:06:03.650> but<00:06:03.860> like<00:06:03.979> I<00:06:04.159> said<00:06:04.220> with<00:06:04.699> the<00:06:04.819> bomb

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
do like it but like I said with the bomb

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.180 
do like it but like I said with the bomb
it<00:06:05.330> doesn't<00:06:05.629> seem<00:06:05.750> to<00:06:05.900> be<00:06:05.990> quite<00:06:06.470> hot<00:06:06.800> it<00:06:06.979> does

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
it doesn't seem to be quite hot it does

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.529 
it doesn't seem to be quite hot it does
give<00:06:07.430> off<00:06:07.520> quite<00:06:07.789> a<00:06:07.819> nice<00:06:08.030> payoff

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
give off quite a nice payoff

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.450 
give off quite a nice payoff
another<00:06:09.020> thing<00:06:09.259> about<00:06:09.289> putting<00:06:09.889> this<00:06:10.009> on<00:06:10.250> your

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
another thing about putting this on your

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.520 
another thing about putting this on your
lips<00:06:10.669> you<00:06:11.180> tend<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.479> get<00:06:11.629> quite<00:06:11.840> a<00:06:11.930> few<00:06:12.050> gaps

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
lips you tend to get quite a few gaps

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
lips you tend to get quite a few gaps
where<00:06:12.949> it<00:06:13.039> doesn't<00:06:13.220> look<00:06:13.430> completely

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
where it doesn't look completely

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.760 
where it doesn't look completely
pigmented<00:06:14.539> it<00:06:14.750> just<00:06:15.020> looks<00:06:15.289> like<00:06:15.379> you<00:06:15.590> have<00:06:15.740> a

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
pigmented it just looks like you have a

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.439 
pigmented it just looks like you have a
felt<00:06:16.039> tip<00:06:16.159> pen<00:06:16.400> you've<00:06:16.909> rubbed<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.180> on<00:06:17.300> your

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
felt tip pen you've rubbed it on your

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.570 
felt tip pen you've rubbed it on your
lips<00:06:17.599> and<00:06:17.810> you've<00:06:17.990> missed<00:06:18.319> gaps<00:06:18.710> it<00:06:19.220> doesn't

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
lips and you've missed gaps it doesn't

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.339 
lips and you've missed gaps it doesn't
seem<00:06:19.759> too<00:06:19.940> smooth<00:06:20.270> all<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:20.720> way<00:06:20.750> around<00:06:21.169> it

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
seem too smooth all the way around it

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.320 
seem too smooth all the way around it
doesn't<00:06:21.680> seem<00:06:21.800> to<00:06:22.009> do<00:06:22.490> proper<00:06:22.880> color<00:06:23.090> payoff

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
doesn't seem to do proper color payoff

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.879 
doesn't seem to do proper color payoff
everywhere<00:06:23.900> so<00:06:24.020> I<00:06:24.050> am<00:06:24.229> sort<00:06:24.500> of<00:06:24.530> impressed

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
everywhere so I am sort of impressed

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.830 
everywhere so I am sort of impressed
with<00:06:25.039> this<00:06:25.130> I<00:06:25.340> do<00:06:25.699> think<00:06:26.180> there<00:06:26.300> are<00:06:26.389> negatives

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
with this I do think there are negatives

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.450 
with this I do think there are negatives
are<00:06:27.050> there<00:06:27.169> are<00:06:27.319> with<00:06:27.500> basically<00:06:28.190> every

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
are there are with basically every

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.890 
are there are with basically every
product<00:06:28.669> I<00:06:28.970> do<00:06:29.030> feel<00:06:29.389> like<00:06:29.509> there<00:06:29.870> are

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
product I do feel like there are

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.990 
product I do feel like there are
positives<00:06:30.440> about<00:06:30.650> it<00:06:30.800> I<00:06:30.949> think<00:06:31.250> that<00:06:31.460> there's

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
positives about it I think that there's

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.969 
positives about it I think that there's
more<00:06:32.180> positives<00:06:32.750> than<00:06:32.870> negatives<00:06:33.289> and<00:06:33.830> I<00:06:33.919> do

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
more positives than negatives and I do

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.770 
more positives than negatives and I do
feel<00:06:34.430> sort<00:06:34.669> of<00:06:34.699> happy<00:06:35.030> with<00:06:35.150> this<00:06:35.270> and<00:06:35.449> I<00:06:35.539> would

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
feel sort of happy with this and I would

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.480 
feel sort of happy with this and I would
use<00:06:36.020> it<00:06:36.169> again<00:06:36.440> and<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:37.069> fact<00:06:37.220> that<00:06:37.280> I've<00:06:37.460> got

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
use it again and the fact that I've got

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.730 
use it again and the fact that I've got
three<00:06:37.970> different<00:06:38.090> colors<00:06:38.569> I<00:06:38.840> can<00:06:39.409> easily

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
three different colors I can easily

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.469 
three different colors I can easily
switch<00:06:40.069> up<00:06:40.340> my<00:06:40.460> look<00:06:40.639> as<00:06:40.789> well<00:06:40.969> so<00:06:41.150> I<00:06:41.210> can<00:06:41.360> do

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
switch up my look as well so I can do

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.809 
switch up my look as well so I can do
more<00:06:41.960> dramatic<00:06:42.409> lips<00:06:42.650> with<00:06:42.919> the<00:06:43.039> dark<00:06:43.280> one<00:06:43.340> and

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
more dramatic lips with the dark one and

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:45.670 
more dramatic lips with the dark one and
I<00:06:43.909> can<00:06:44.150> do<00:06:44.300> lighter<00:06:44.840> lips<00:06:45.199> with<00:06:45.380> like<00:06:45.530> the

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
I can do lighter lips with like the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.709 
I can do lighter lips with like the
pinky<00:06:46.039> rosy<00:06:46.310> one<00:06:46.639> so<00:06:47.030> I<00:06:47.060> think<00:06:47.270> now<00:06:47.509> that's

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:47.719 
pinky rosy one so I think now that's

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.899 
pinky rosy one so I think now that's
quite<00:06:47.990> good<00:06:48.020> as<00:06:48.379> it<00:06:48.919> would<00:06:49.039> be<00:06:49.159> quite<00:06:49.490> diverse

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909 
quite good as it would be quite diverse

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.100 
quite good as it would be quite diverse
I<00:06:50.120> don't<00:06:50.360> know<00:06:50.449> if<00:06:50.569> it's<00:06:50.719> going<00:06:50.900> to<00:06:50.960> look

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
I don't know if it's going to look

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.020 
I don't know if it's going to look
different<00:06:51.169> with<00:06:51.889> the<00:06:52.190> lighter<00:06:52.400> color<00:06:52.699> I<00:06:52.789> don't

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
different with the lighter color I don't

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.980 
different with the lighter color I don't
know<00:06:53.120> if<00:06:53.240> that's<00:06:53.419> going<00:06:53.599> to<00:06:53.690> look<00:06:53.840> any

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
know if that's going to look any

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.779 
know if that's going to look any
different<00:06:54.229> if<00:06:54.710> the<00:06:55.190> color<00:06:55.370> is<00:06:55.460> going<00:06:55.610> to<00:06:55.669> be

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
different if the color is going to be

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.309 
different if the color is going to be
different<00:06:55.969> with<00:06:56.210> that<00:06:56.360> but<00:06:56.539> with<00:06:56.870> this<00:06:57.050> I'm

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 
different with that but with this I'm

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.070 
different with that but with this I'm
quite<00:06:57.740> happy<00:06:57.919> I<00:06:58.310> think<00:06:58.909> it<00:06:59.060> does<00:06:59.210> its<00:06:59.360> job<00:06:59.419> so

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
quite happy I think it does its job so

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.920 
quite happy I think it does its job so
let's<00:07:00.409> do<00:07:00.830> one<00:07:01.250> last<00:07:01.460> test<00:07:01.849> and<00:07:02.120> see<00:07:02.479> if<00:07:02.509> it's

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
let's do one last test and see if it's

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.290 
let's do one last test and see if it's
kiss<00:07:03.229> proof<00:07:03.500> and<00:07:03.740> transfer<00:07:04.340> proof<00:07:04.639> like<00:07:05.150> it

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
kiss proof and transfer proof like it

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.790 
kiss proof and transfer proof like it
says<00:07:05.539> because<00:07:05.719> on<00:07:05.930> here<00:07:06.110> it<00:07:06.169> says<00:07:06.319> transfer

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
says because on here it says transfer

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.580 
says because on here it says transfer
proof<00:07:07.099> lip<00:07:07.430> tint<00:07:07.729> and<00:07:07.909> bump<00:07:08.210> so<00:07:08.719> let's<00:07:09.050> see<00:07:09.319> if

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
proof lip tint and bump so let's see if

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.939 
proof lip tint and bump so let's see if
there<00:07:10.219> are<00:07:10.250> any<00:07:10.370> transfers<00:07:11.270> on<00:07:11.509> my<00:07:11.719> hand<00:07:11.960> there

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
there are any transfers on my hand there

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.830 
there are any transfers on my hand there
is<00:07:12.979> a<00:07:13.400> little<00:07:13.610> bit<00:07:13.759> of<00:07:13.909> transfer<00:07:14.360> I<00:07:14.539> don't<00:07:14.750> know

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
is a little bit of transfer I don't know

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.209 
is a little bit of transfer I don't know
if<00:07:14.900> you<00:07:14.990> can<00:07:15.139> see<00:07:15.319> that<00:07:15.529> let<00:07:15.650> me<00:07:15.740> zoom<00:07:15.919> in<00:07:16.159> and

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:16.219 
if you can see that let me zoom in and

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.309 
if you can see that let me zoom in and
show<00:07:16.340> you<00:07:16.639> so<00:07:17.210> that's<00:07:17.419> the<00:07:17.569> color<00:07:17.779> and<00:07:18.050> it<00:07:18.139> has

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 
show you so that's the color and it has
