00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 today we will talk about buildings 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.860
 built with human bones heads 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.160
 arms legs in the middle ages was very 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.800
 common for some chapels and churches 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.160
 they will fill in their structure with piles and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.930
 heaps of bones in some cases 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 surpassing the thousands and thousands of people 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.050
 thousands of corpses covering the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 walls of these buildings and the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.840
 preparing because the images that you are going 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.880
 to see they are quite spooky and they are 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.690
 places that the truth if you ever go 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.280
 to see them you are going to be scared 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.670
 basically because there are thousands and thousands 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.100
 of skulls scattered around the places 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.350
 that I am going to quote next I am going to 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 quote the most important there are many more 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 because the average age was very typical 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 use let's say these skulls these 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.800
 bones let's say to be closer to the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.900
 sir closer to heaven and it was an honor 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.760
 be buried that way 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.460
 far from what many people can 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.620
 think at that time was not seen 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 as something abnormal, people followed 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.650
 going to these churches despite 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.270
 be full of corpses we have in 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.179
 first place a church 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.439

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:35.929
 the remains of 5 thousand 800 people to 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.710
 early 14th century and still lingers 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:42.400
 today as you can see 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.280
 we also have the bones chapel 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.360

 he built this small size chapel 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.509
 with the bones of more than five thousand 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.690

 the architect Antonio did not even design 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 this crypt at the request of the urban pope 8 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.200
 was built between the year 1600 26 and the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.180
 year 1600 31 and contains the remains of 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 3700 friars who were first 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.319
 buried to decompose 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.319
 everything except the bones 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.440

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.180
 discovered in the year 2001 and opened to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.390
 open time 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.250

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.730
 17th and 18th centuries set 50,000 lives 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 human 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.190
 it must be amazing to be in this 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.290
 place not 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.320

 Peru , we are going to South America and 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.520
 good as you can see the traditions 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.580
 Christians also came to these 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.630
 lands the church was consecrated in the year 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:37.250
 thousand 673 and its catacombs were used 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:41.750
 until 1808 they contain bones of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.420

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.420

 bernardino ale osa in milan in italy 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.110
 as not the cradle of religion the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.890
 lands of this church housed 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.510
 also a cemetery between the thousand year 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:09.390
 145 and the year 2000 210 in the year 269 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.410
 a camera was built to house 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.690
 all the bones and an adjoining church 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.320
 giovanni andrea beef and restored it in the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.170
 year thousand 679 and added the gloomy 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.120
 ornaments of the walls using bones 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.130
 we go back to portugal where we find 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.740
 also another bone chapel in 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.740
 Faro in Portugal and we 're going south to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:38.180
 the area of the Algar of leaving pardon me 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.940
 built in the year one thousand 719 using 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.900
 the bones as main matter is 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.480
 say as basic foundation contains 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.920
 also a full covered skeleton 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.320
 of gold 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.410
 we have another place that is the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.400
 hall statement house on staten at 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.740
 austria that since 1700 20 then the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.840
 custom in this ossuary was to paint the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.030
 names of the deceased in the skulls 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:13.889
 or even decorate them there are more than 1200 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.790
 skulls and 620 are decorated 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.950
 even more gloomy if they fit 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.970
 we also have the bones chapel 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:26.180
 of serna in poland built in the year 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.130
 1776 that contains the bones of people 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.640
 who died in the so-called war of 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:35.200
 the 30 years as well as in conflicts and 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.200
 later epidemics 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.320
 we also have the catacombs of paris 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.090
 in france 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.580
 and the most surprising thing about all this is 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:50.340
 that there are about 320 kilometers of 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:54.480
 catacombs and tunnels under paris 17 km from 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.390
 those 320 are good tunnels are a 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:03.090
 huge ossuary that keeps the remains of 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:05.400
 between 6 and 7 million people already 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.280
 we talk about exaggerated amounts of 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.110
 people or nobody nobody all over the world 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.660
 know paris for being a very 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.390
 romantic very beautiful but nobody 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.240
 expect him to be walking over 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.940
 millions of corpses no but this is what 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.770
 that is done so you already know the possible 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.900
 the next time you go remember 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.419
 this 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.110
 we also have the skull tower of 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.850
 circular in anise in serbia and good the 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.060
 history of this basically is that in 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.699
 the year 1809 the Turkish general husky 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.360
 passat ordered to build this sinister 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:44.650
 warning with the skulls of 952 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:49.009
 Serbian rebels the original media tower 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.720
 46 meters high and 4 side with the 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.490
 over the years the families of the 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.650
 deceased have been recovering the 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:01.139
 remains and today there are only 58 skulls and 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.319
 so we can go on and on and on and on 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.539
 as you can see there are innumerable 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:10.080
 testimonies of human remains that have 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:12.210
 been buried in churches chapels and 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.300
 others even if we go to Paris 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.819
 we can see millions of corpses that 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.699
 that dare let's say to cross 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:23.729
 Paris underground is not going against 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.740
 certainly a nice scene and it's 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.439
 that at the end of the day at that time 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.960
 buried millions of people and they 

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:33.650
 their skeletons remained as proof of 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.650
 what had happened
