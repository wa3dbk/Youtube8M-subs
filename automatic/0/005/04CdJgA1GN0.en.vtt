just put a little bit here and then I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.890 
just put a little bit here and then I
spread<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:23.210> barely<00:00:24.210> any<00:00:24.390> paint

spread it out so I have barely any paint

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
spread it out so I have barely any paint
on<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.500> paintbrush<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.670> just

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
on my paintbrush of this and then just

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.540 
on my paintbrush of this and then just
lightly<00:00:27.090> brush<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.960> over<00:00:28.289> they'll<00:00:29.220> give<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
lightly brush all over they'll give it a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.519 
lightly brush all over they'll give it a
rock<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.970> look<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.539> hopefully<00:00:31.320> I'll<00:00:31.500> be

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
rock like look and hopefully I'll be

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.920 
rock like look and hopefully I'll be
able<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:33.000> other<00:00:33.120> stuff<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> which

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
able to do some other stuff to it which

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
able to do some other stuff to it which
I'll<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.700> actually<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> time

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I'll get to if I actually have the time

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170 
I'll get to if I actually have the time
to<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> dry<00:00:38.760> brushing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180

rock here that looks lighter is what
I've<00:01:01.500> pretty<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:01.829> done<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.210> side<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I've pretty much done then this side I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
I've pretty much done then this side I
haven't<00:01:04.019> done<00:01:04.199> yet<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
haven't done yet so I'm going to do a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
haven't done yet so I'm going to do a
nice<00:01:05.489> close<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.960> for<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> guys<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.409> can

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
nice close up for you guys so you can

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.910 
nice close up for you guys so you can
see<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> looks<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> see

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
see what it looks like so if you can see

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
see what it looks like so if you can see
there's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:11.510> very<00:01:12.510> light<00:01:12.780> brushes<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
there's just some very light brushes of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.510 
there's just some very light brushes of
light<00:01:14.430> grey<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.439> it<00:01:16.439> makes<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> look<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
light grey and it makes it look that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.170 
light grey and it makes it look that
much<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:18.030> realistic<00:01:19.640> compared<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.000> ones

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
much more realistic compared to the ones

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.050 
much more realistic compared to the ones
without<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> difference

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
without it you can see the difference

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.920 
without it you can see the difference
it's<00:01:24.439> pretty<00:01:25.439> drastic<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:27.659> actually

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's pretty drastic if it's actually

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.179 
it's pretty drastic if it's actually
more<00:01:28.020> dressing<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.439> real<00:01:28.560> life<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.860> camera

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
more dressing in real life this camera

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.999 
more dressing in real life this camera
is<00:01:29.220> making<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.000> funky<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.009> all

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
is making it look kind of funky but all

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.740 
is making it look kind of funky but all
I<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.790> grab<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.210> paint<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.600> actually

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I do just grab a little paint I actually

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
I do just grab a little paint I actually
needed<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.560> paint<00:01:34.829> than<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
needed a little more paint than I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
needed a little more paint than I
originally<00:01:35.729> thought<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.360> whatever<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
originally thought but whatever so I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
originally thought but whatever so I
lightly<00:01:38.369> take<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.420> brush<00:01:39.750> off

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
lightly take it and then just brush off

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.499 
lightly take it and then just brush off
most<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.799> some<00:01:41.490> paper<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.450> just

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
most of it on some paper and then just

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.780 
most of it on some paper and then just
do<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:46.140> simple<00:01:46.560> no<00:01:47.280> need<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.670> any

added a little tint of green to every
underside<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.110> rock<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.500> any<00:03:04.650> shadow<00:03:04.950> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
underside of a rock and any shadow that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.450 
underside of a rock and any shadow that
it<00:03:05.310> would<00:03:05.550> cast<00:03:05.990> so<00:03:06.990> any<00:03:07.140> dark<00:03:07.470> places<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.430> I

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
it would cast so any dark places that I

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.560

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
see with any shadows I just painted it a

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.570 
see with any shadows I just painted it a
