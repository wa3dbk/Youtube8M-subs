00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
so I recently went on a little trip for

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.619 
so I recently went on a little trip for
three<00:00:04.890> days<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.370> Negril<00:00:05.609> Falls<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.450> is

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
three days to Negril Falls and this is

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.370 
three days to Negril Falls and this is
the<00:00:06.779> camera<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.030> exclusively<00:00:09.030> used<00:00:09.380> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the camera that I exclusively used to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.690 
the camera that I exclusively used to
shoot<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.480> am<00:00:12.480> absolutely<00:00:13.490> impressed<00:00:14.490> with

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
shoot and I am absolutely impressed with

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.689 
shoot and I am absolutely impressed with
it<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.740> such<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> good<00:00:17.070> camera

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it it is such a good camera

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.700 
it it is such a good camera
it<00:00:18.359> has<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.130> same<00:00:20.130> size<00:00:20.369> sensor<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
it has the same size sensor as the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.620 
it has the same size sensor as the
bigger<00:00:22.710> camera<00:00:23.750> g15<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.519> Nikon<00:00:26.519> p77<00:00:27.210> hundred

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
bigger camera g15 and Nikon p77 hundred

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.359 
bigger camera g15 and Nikon p77 hundred
I<00:00:27.750> believe<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.820> it's<00:00:29.820> similar<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.990> P<00:00:31.439> 330

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I believe and it's similar to the P 330

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000 
I believe and it's similar to the P 330
from<00:00:32.700> Nikon<00:00:33.200> there<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> few<00:00:34.649> differences

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
from Nikon there are a few differences

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.319 
from Nikon there are a few differences
the<00:00:35.340> Nikon<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.059> has<00:00:37.730> 920<00:00:38.730> dot<00:00:38.910> screen

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the Nikon actually has 920 dot screen

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.319 
the Nikon actually has 920 dot screen
and<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.629> has<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> 460<00:00:40.700> this<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> touch

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and this has a 460 this one is a touch

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.060 
and this has a 460 this one is a touch
screen<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.760> originally<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:46.079> was

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
screen and originally I was like I was

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
screen and originally I was like I was
not<00:00:47.250> pleased<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.450> don't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
not pleased with that because I don't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.979 
not pleased with that because I don't
really<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.200> touch<00:00:50.160> screens<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.809> this<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
really like touch screens but this is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
really like touch screens but this is
not<00:00:52.199> even<00:00:52.379> close<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:54.110> 320<00:00:55.110> HS<00:00:55.770> touch

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
not even close to the 320 HS touch

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.819 
not even close to the 320 HS touch
screen<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.930> full<00:00:58.199> set<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> buttons

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
screen this has a full set of buttons

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
screen this has a full set of buttons
just<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> s100<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
just like the s100 so you can use the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
just like the s100 so you can use the
buttons<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> never<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> test<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:02.760> if

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
buttons and never use the test game if

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
buttons and never use the test game if
you<00:01:03.149> want<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> touch<00:01:04.589> actually<00:01:04.799> works

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you want but the touch actually works

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.640 
you want but the touch actually works
very<00:01:05.189> well<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.600> say<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.900> almost<00:01:07.200> works<00:01:07.500> as

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
very well I would say it almost works as

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
very well I would say it almost works as
well<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.150> something<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.420> iPhone<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:11.330> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
well as something like an iPhone and you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
well as something like an iPhone and you
can<00:01:12.540> touch<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.020> select<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.830> focusing<00:01:14.460> frame

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
can touch to select the focusing frame

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.289 
can touch to select the focusing frame
similar<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> iPhone<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:18.060> can

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
similar to the iPhone and you can

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.179 
similar to the iPhone and you can
navigate<00:01:19.020> through<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> menus<00:01:19.890> with

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
navigate through all the menus with

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.030 
navigate through all the menus with
touch<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.680> everything

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
touch you can do just about everything

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
touch you can do just about everything
with<00:01:23.310> touch<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.990> works<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.470> very

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
with touch and it works it's very

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.120 
with touch and it works it's very
responsive<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.580> works<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> was

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
responsive it works very well so I was

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.870 
responsive it works very well so I was
extremely<00:01:29.790> impressed<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.850> like<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
extremely impressed with that and like I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.429 
extremely impressed with that and like I
said<00:01:33.000> there's<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> full<00:01:33.689> set<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> buttons<00:01:34.290> as

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
said there's a full set of buttons as

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
said there's a full set of buttons as
well<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.250> exclusively<00:01:36.210> use

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
well so you can you just exclusively use

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.980 
well so you can you just exclusively use
the<00:01:36.600> hard<00:01:36.869> buttons<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.990> best

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the hard buttons if you want to but best

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.990 
the hard buttons if you want to but best
of<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> actual<00:01:41.750> image<00:01:42.750> quality<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
of all is the actual image quality so

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
of all is the actual image quality so
the<00:01:45.000> image<00:01:45.570> quality<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> said<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> sensor

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the image quality like I said the sensor

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.690 
the image quality like I said the sensor
is<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> same<00:01:47.670> size<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.420> g15<00:01:48.930> sensor<00:01:49.700> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
is the same size as the g15 sensor and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
is the same size as the g15 sensor and
this<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.689> course<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.320> smaller

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
this of course it's a much smaller

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
this of course it's a much smaller
camera<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.970> having<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.329> sensor<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
camera so having a sensor like that and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.340 
camera so having a sensor like that and
I'm<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.320> small<00:01:55.619> camera<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.369> very<00:01:56.460> nice<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
I'm a small camera is very nice and the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
I'm a small camera is very nice and the
build<00:01:58.530> quality<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.920> fantastic<00:01:59.119> the<00:02:00.119> image

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
build quality is fantastic the image

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
build quality is fantastic the image
quality<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:00.990> say<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:02.219> close

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
quality I would say is very very close

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
quality I would say is very very close
to<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.600> g15

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to the g15

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.200 
to the g15
the<00:02:04.560> only<00:02:04.799> difference<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.460> has<00:02:05.670> an<00:02:05.790> f/2

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the only difference is this has an f/2

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.850 
the only difference is this has an f/2
lens<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:07.229> g15<00:02:07.560> has<00:02:08.039> an<00:02:08.250> F<00:02:09.050> 1.8<00:02:10.050> lens<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.560> believe

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
lens the g15 has an F 1.8 lens I believe

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.790 
lens the g15 has an F 1.8 lens I believe
so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.320 
so
the<00:02:13.780> quality<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.840> very<00:02:14.900> similar<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:17.090> has

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
the quality is very similar and this has

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.690 
megapixel five times optical zoom and I
can<00:02:23.510> also<00:02:23.660> say<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.020> when<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.800> zoom<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
can also say that when you zoom in the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.880 
can also say that when you zoom in the
full<00:02:25.910> amount<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.390> full<00:02:26.570> five<00:02:26.810> times<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
full amount the full five times the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.190 
full amount the full five times the
images<00:02:28.280> stay<00:02:28.490> very<00:02:28.880> very<00:02:29.210> sharp<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.750> even

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
images stay very very sharp and even

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.450 
images stay very very sharp and even
low-light<00:02:30.590> performance<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:31.810> very<00:02:32.810> very<00:02:33.460> solid

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
low-light performance is very very solid

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.980 
low-light performance is very very solid
and<00:02:34.990> higher<00:02:35.990> ISO<00:02:36.670> anything<00:02:37.670> up<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.940> 1600<00:02:38.660> ISO

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.930 
and higher ISO anything up to 1600 ISO
even<00:02:39.410> with<00:02:39.560> JPEGs<00:02:40.040> are<00:02:41.380> very<00:02:42.380> good<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.820> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
even with JPEGs are very good so the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.580 
even with JPEGs are very good so the
actual<00:02:44.330> camera<00:02:44.810> itself<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:47.080> nice<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.320> small

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
actual camera itself is nice and small

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.930 
actual camera itself is nice and small
its<00:02:49.090> larger<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.240> heavier<00:02:50.420> than<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.170> sony<00:02:51.940> WX

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
its larger and heavier than the sony WX

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
its larger and heavier than the sony WX
200<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.600> have<00:02:53.810> by<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.290> fair<00:02:54.680> amount<00:02:54.800> but

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
200 that I have by a fair amount but

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.050 
200 that I have by a fair amount but
it's<00:02:56.960> not<00:02:57.230> too<00:02:57.500> much<00:02:57.650> bigger<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.790> has<00:02:59.030> a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
it's not too much bigger and it has a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.260 
it's not too much bigger and it has a
much<00:02:59.300> better<00:02:59.480> bill<00:02:59.780> koi<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.350> heavier<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.860> bit

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
much better bill koi it's heavier a bit

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.300 
much better bill koi it's heavier a bit
but<00:03:02.270> it's<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.780> lot<00:03:02.990> more<00:03:03.020> solid<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.830> feels<00:03:04.070> like

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
but it's a lot more solid it feels like

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.900 
but it's a lot more solid it feels like
it<00:03:04.490> would<00:03:04.700> be<00:03:04.730> more<00:03:05.690> durable<00:03:05.990> so<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:07.550> can<00:03:07.730> see

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
it would be more durable so you can see

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.510 
it would be more durable so you can see
here<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.180> still<00:03:08.390> has<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.720> full<00:03:09.160> buttons<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
here it still has the full buttons the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.520 
here it still has the full buttons the
full<00:03:10.730> set<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.000> buttons<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.720> s100<00:03:12.350> has

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
and the touch screen works extremely

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.370

things with the zoom wheel that's on the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.580 
things with the zoom wheel that's on the
lens<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:50.420> one<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.780> features<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.260> really

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
lens that's one of the features I really

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.460 
lens that's one of the features I really
like<00:03:51.800> because<00:03:52.990> it<00:03:53.990> actually<00:03:54.350> gives<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.740> one

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
like because it actually gives you one

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.100 
like because it actually gives you one
like<00:03:57.470> 28<00:03:57.980> 35<00:03:59.020> 50<00:04:00.020> 85<00:04:00.620> 100<00:04:01.570> 120<00:04:02.570> in<00:04:02.720> steps

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
like 28 35 50 85 100 120 in steps

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.660 
like 28 35 50 85 100 120 in steps
instead<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.800> just<00:04:04.550> showing<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.170> how<00:04:06.670> many

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
instead of just showing you how many

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.080 
instead of just showing you how many
times<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.300> or<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:10.100> other<00:04:10.250> Canon<00:04:10.760> cameras

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
times it is or the other Canon cameras

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.680 
times it is or the other Canon cameras
also<00:04:11.420> give<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.890> like<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.920> distance<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.760> prefer

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
also give you like a distance I prefer

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.580 
also give you like a distance I prefer
using<00:04:15.380> this<00:04:15.770> steps<00:04:16.400> method<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.590> that's

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
using this steps method and that's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.280 
using this steps method and that's
really<00:04:18.890> nice<00:04:19.100> it<00:04:19.340> also<00:04:19.489> has<00:04:19.820> an<00:04:20.290> electric

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
really nice it also has an electric

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.560 
really nice it also has an electric
up-and-down<00:04:21.859> flash<00:04:22.220> which<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.030> really<00:04:23.300> fast

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
up-and-down flash which is really fast

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.350 
up-and-down flash which is really fast
and<00:04:23.840> really<00:04:23.990> smooth

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
and really smooth

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.240 
and really smooth
and<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.960> works<00:04:27.170> really<00:04:27.230> nice<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.950> button

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
and so that works really nice the button

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.180 
and so that works really nice the button
the<00:04:28.400> dial<00:04:28.730> at<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.880> top<00:04:29.090> here<00:04:29.420> is<00:04:29.740> great<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:31.040> has

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
the dial at the top here is great it has

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.940 
the dial at the top here is great it has
a<00:04:31.250> good<00:04:31.490> click<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:33.320> button<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.920> a

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
a good click to it the button is a

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.870 
a good click to it the button is a
little<00:04:34.220> bit<00:04:34.460> close<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.730> this<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:35.930> it's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
little bit close to this so it's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.450 
little bit close to this so it's
sometimes<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.180> doesn't<00:04:38.740> feel<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.860> great<00:04:40.220> to

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
sometimes it doesn't feel that great to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.880 
sometimes it doesn't feel that great to
press<00:04:40.700> but<00:04:40.970> it's<00:04:41.210> easy<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.660> get<00:04:41.840> used<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.230> and

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
press but it's easy to get used to and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.540 
press but it's easy to get used to and
then<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:44.300> top<00:04:44.570> shutter<00:04:44.930> button<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.530> nice<00:04:46.280> and

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
then the top shutter button is nice and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.140 
then the top shutter button is nice and
wide

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
wide

there<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:12.160> was<00:05:13.160> extremely<00:05:13.730> impressed<00:05:14.300> with

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
there but I was extremely impressed with

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.750 
there but I was extremely impressed with
the<00:05:14.570> image<00:05:14.780> quality<00:05:15.220> throughout<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.460> entire

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
the image quality throughout the entire

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.510 
the image quality throughout the entire
trip<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.390> I<00:05:17.450> definitely<00:05:17.840> recommend<00:05:18.140> it<00:05:18.470> but<00:05:19.460> I

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
trip and I definitely recommend it but I

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.120 
trip and I definitely recommend it but I
would<00:05:19.850> also<00:05:20.000> have<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> look<00:05:20.630> at<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.080> nikon<00:05:21.500> p300

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
would also have a look at the nikon p300

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.760 
would also have a look at the nikon p300
because<00:05:22.730> like<00:05:22.910> I<00:05:23.060> said<00:05:23.120> I<00:05:23.300> believe<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.870> P<00:05:24.260> 330

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
because like I said I believe the P 330

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.570 
because like I said I believe the P 330
is<00:05:25.370> very<00:05:25.730> similar<00:05:26.180> except<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:26.630> has<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.590> 922

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
is very similar except it has the 922

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.730 
is very similar except it has the 922
dot<00:05:28.880> screen<00:05:29.360> which<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:30.140> lot<00:05:30.470> higher<00:05:30.710> than

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
dot screen which is a lot higher than

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.740 
dot screen which is a lot higher than
this<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:33.380> has<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:34.010> believe<00:05:34.340> a<00:05:34.370> 1.8<00:05:35.030> lens<00:05:35.330> and

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
this and it has I believe a 1.8 lens and

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.190 
this and it has I believe a 1.8 lens and
this<00:05:35.870> has<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.050> f/2<00:05:36.830> lens<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.630> want<00:05:38.930> to<00:05:39.050> have

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
this has a f/2 lens so you want to have

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.950 
this has a f/2 lens so you want to have
a<00:05:39.230> look<00:05:39.410> at<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:39.800> peak<00:05:40.310> Nikon<00:05:40.730> p33<00:05:41.330> as<00:05:41.540> well<00:05:41.720> but

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
a look at the peak Nikon p33 as well but

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.110 
a look at the peak Nikon p33 as well but
I<00:05:42.020> would<00:05:42.110> definitely<00:05:42.560> recommend<00:05:42.790> this<00:05:43.790> for

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
I would definitely recommend this for

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.300 
I would definitely recommend this for
sure
