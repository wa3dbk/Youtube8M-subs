are<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> centimeter<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.680> do

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
are about a centimeter but you can do

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.789 
are about a centimeter but you can do

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
right over my pins and hopefully the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.289 
right over my pins and hopefully the
needles<00:01:27.240> won't<00:01:27.509> break<00:01:27.780> sometimes<00:01:28.909> with<00:01:29.909> denim

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
needles won't break sometimes with denim

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
needles won't break sometimes with denim
material<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.650> pretty<00:01:31.950> sick<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> want

want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> forfeit<00:01:37.020> too<00:01:37.200> much

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.840 

you<00:01:44.060> want<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.270> mind<00:01:44.450> fly<00:01:44.750> because<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:45.740> get<00:01:46.460> funky

you want to mind fly because I get funky
it's<00:01:47.030> tricky<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.200> turned<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
it's tricky so I just turned it to the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.889 
it's tricky so I just turned it to the
other<00:01:49.189> side<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.270> continue<00:01:50.659> all<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.810> way

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
other side and you continue all the way

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.120 
other side and you continue all the way
or<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:54.320> give<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.590> nice<00:01:54.740> pressing

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
or you can give it a nice pressing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.770 
or you can give it a nice pressing
afterwards<00:01:55.579> I've<00:01:55.820> oppressed<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.439> but<00:01:58.780> start

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
afterwards I've oppressed that but start
