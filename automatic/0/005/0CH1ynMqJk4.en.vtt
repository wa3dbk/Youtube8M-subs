00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 we indicate the depth of sampling and the very 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 breed name to 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.730
 laboratories it was all clear to people 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.160
 on land Crimea Kuban and the island Tuzla exactly 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 also crashing into the ground looking for support too 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.449
 and exactly die out the landscape on these 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:28.650
 marshy coast lies the main 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 the load, that is, the record, well, this is the beginning 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 project transport transition in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 nineteen kilometers it starts with 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.320
 low water bridge which will go to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.629
 braids tuzla railway and highway 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.940
 go parallel design smoothly 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.950
 lies on the island and after 6 kilometers 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 transport branch grows already in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.690
 another bridge is big here and supports 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.890
 much higher and the railway is hiding 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.410
 under the motorway 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.780
 This is the Kerch ship canal and ships 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.960
 here of course passes the great sea 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.449
 class and for the Crimea and Kuban and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.469
 countries vital volume project 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.369
 shipments 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:11.340
 calculated for in forecast development and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.340
 he will be 4-lane automotive and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.360
 rail live we immediately 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.790
 laying the prospect of development because 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.560
 In addition to the transfer of tourists in the season 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.320
 Crimea need to increase supply 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.049
 fuel products products so now 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.820
 and it is important to find a place of support and technology 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.710
 who are able to cope with 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.640
 challenging the construction of a bridge in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.460
 Kerch Strait 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.380
 with its muddy bottom winds washing out than 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.539
 camping ground has a very different and 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.240
 reinforced concrete with silicon 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.850
 the so-called micro celica which 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.140
 makes it almost everlasting even in water and on 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 on powder which 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.940
 loose water containing sand make 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.560
 in rock and fiber concrete is a new way 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.360
 formations where instead of the usual 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.060
 welded reinforcement used polymeric 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.259
 hairs are visual laboratory 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.720
 example in the capital building 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.950
 Institute, so under pressure cracks 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.200
 normal support and now pressure in 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.780
 one and a half times more and the support does not prick 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.489
 it is fibrobeton but still too early to say 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.070
 what technologies will be chosen for 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.079
 construction of the Kerch bridge 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.640
 they are there and so-called 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.840
 preliminary deadlines 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.829
 the launch of the facility in operation is 2018 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.180
 year ilya Philipps to lead the week 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.180
 This is because they believe further program
