00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so that's going this direction to the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.810 
so that's going this direction to the
center<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> ear<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the color is here and it gradually

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.480 
the color is here and it gradually
blends<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:24.409> towards<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> year<00:01:25.770> without
