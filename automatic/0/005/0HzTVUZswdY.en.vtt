00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.660 
unfortunately because the Sun makes
things<00:04:43.750> hotter<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.410> we<00:04:45.190> don't<00:04:45.460> like<00:04:45.640> that

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
things hotter and we don't like that

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.590 
things hotter and we don't like that
well<00:04:46.450> we<00:04:47.350> don't<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.430> controls<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:48.970> adjusting

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
well we don't the controls for adjusting

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.420 
well we don't the controls for adjusting
the<00:04:49.720> panoramic<00:04:50.290> roof<00:04:50.440> window<00:04:50.860> are<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.040> bit

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
the panoramic roof window are a bit

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.400 
the panoramic roof window are a bit
tricky<00:04:51.700> like<00:04:52.240> when<00:04:52.390> i<00:04:52.420> try<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.720> open<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.110> shade

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
tricky like when i try to open the shade

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.470 
tricky like when i try to open the shade
this<00:04:53.920> part<00:04:54.250> opens<00:04:54.580> up<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:54.820> i<00:04:54.880> don't<00:04:55.030> want<00:04:55.300> this

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
this part opens up and i don't want this

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.000 
this part opens up and i don't want this
part<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.810> open<00:04:56.080> up<00:04:56.170> i<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.290> wanted<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.710> open<00:04:56.800> up

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
part to open up i just wanted to open up

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.180 
part to open up i just wanted to open up
the<00:04:57.130> shade<00:04:57.510> imagine<00:04:58.510> if<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:59.230> was<00:04:59.410> raining<00:04:59.950> and

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
the shade imagine if it was raining and

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.100 
the shade imagine if it was raining and
then<00:05:00.490> i<00:05:00.580> got<00:05:00.760> rained<00:05:01.090> on<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.780> would<00:05:01.990> have

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
then i got rained on that would have

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.320 
then i got rained on that would have
been<00:05:02.260> awesome<00:05:02.470> another<00:05:03.070> bonus<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.820> felt
