those weird number ones this is going
fine<00:00:56.079> we<00:00:56.590> actually<00:00:56.829> saw<00:00:56.980> screenshots<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.850> while

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
fine we actually saw screenshots a while

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.569 
fine we actually saw screenshots a while
back<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.600> like<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.320> bunch<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.680> new<00:00:59.800> features<00:00:59.949> so

back of like a bunch of new features so
i'm<00:01:00.640> guessing<00:01:00.820> going<00:01:01.239> fine<00:01:01.420> means<00:01:01.719> that<00:01:02.230> i

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
i'm guessing going fine means that i

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.590 
i'm guessing going fine means that i
could<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:03.010> done<00:01:03.789> fortunately<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.510> doesn't

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
could it done fortunately it doesn't

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.970 
could it done fortunately it doesn't
mean<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.020> they're<00:01:05.170> closing<00:01:05.530> in<00:01:05.650> because<00:01:05.860> if

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
mean that they're closing in because if

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.920 
mean that they're closing in because if
they<00:01:06.370> if<00:01:06.580> they<00:01:06.820> meant<00:01:07.060> they<00:01:07.300> were<00:01:07.420> almost<00:01:07.600> done

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
they if they meant they were almost done

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.900 
they if they meant they were almost done
that<00:01:08.200> i<00:01:08.260> think<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.620> would<00:01:08.800> say<00:01:09.100> like<00:01:09.670> we're

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
that i think they would say like we're

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.400 
that i think they would say like we're
coming<00:01:10.300> around<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.690> bend<00:01:10.810> like<00:01:11.140> we're<00:01:11.320> almost

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
coming around the bend like we're almost

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.830 
coming around the bend like we're almost
done<00:01:11.800> you<00:01:12.490> know<00:01:12.610> some<00:01:12.940> some<00:01:13.300> weird<00:01:13.540> little

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
done you know some some weird little

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.180 
done you know some some weird little
phrase<00:01:14.110> saying<00:01:14.530> they<00:01:14.680> were<00:01:14.740> almost<00:01:14.890> done

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
phrase saying they were almost done

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.490 
phrase saying they were almost done
since<00:01:15.880> they're<00:01:16.000> going<00:01:16.240> fine<00:01:16.510> i'm<00:01:17.050> thinking

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
since they're going fine i'm thinking

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.830 
since they're going fine i'm thinking
this<00:01:17.770> still<00:01:18.100> has<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> lot<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.670> room<00:01:18.910> left<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.390> do

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
this still has a lot of room left to do

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.860 
this still has a lot of room left to do
unfortunately<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.740> it's<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:21.640> upsetting<00:01:21.970> but

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
unfortunately that it's so upsetting but

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.540 
unfortunately that it's so upsetting but
but<00:01:23.500> unfortunately<00:01:23.950> i<00:01:24.010> think<00:01:24.220> that's<00:01:24.370> what's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
but unfortunately i think that's what's

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.710 
but unfortunately i think that's what's
gonna<00:01:24.640> happen<00:01:24.970> i<00:01:25.030> think<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:25.300> still<00:01:25.480> a<00:01:25.510> ways

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
gonna happen i think it's still a ways

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.020 
gonna happen i think it's still a ways
off<00:01:25.900> then<00:01:26.530> here<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.770> says<00:01:26.920> well<00:01:27.460> posed<00:01:27.640> shots

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
off then here it says well posed shots

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.910 
off then here it says well posed shots
later<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:28.480> week<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:29.200> i'm<00:01:29.320> guessing<00:01:29.500> also

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
later this week so i'm guessing also

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.260 
later this week so i'm guessing also
just<00:01:30.130> like<00:01:30.250> before<00:01:30.400> how<00:01:30.730> they<00:01:30.880> had<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> little

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
just like before how they had a little

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.490 
just like before how they had a little
screenshots<00:01:31.780> I'm<00:01:31.990> guess<00:01:32.110> that's<00:01:32.290> what<00:01:32.410> I'll

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
screenshots I'm guess that's what I'll

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.190 
screenshots I'm guess that's what I'll
do<00:01:32.620> again<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:34.090> this<00:01:34.270> time<00:01:34.330> instead<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.900> like

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
do again but this time instead of like

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.570 
do again but this time instead of like
new<00:01:35.380> features<00:01:35.710> they're<00:01:36.190> actually<00:01:36.400> going<00:01:36.490> to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
new features they're actually going to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.850 
new features they're actually going to
show<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.760> interfaces<00:01:37.210> if<00:01:37.300> you<00:01:37.360> don't<00:01:37.510> know

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
show the interfaces if you don't know

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.740 
show the interfaces if you don't know
creative<00:01:38.860> mode<00:01:39.070> has<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> different<00:01:40.630> look

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
creative mode has like a different look

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.630 
creative mode has like a different look
to<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:41.140> then<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.770> know<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.010> normal<00:01:42.340> survival

the end anvil if you don't know um like

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.880 
the end anvil if you don't know um like
I<00:02:24.600> guess<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.050> best<00:02:25.200> way<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.380> compare<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.770> would

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
I guess the best way to compare it would

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.320 
I guess the best way to compare it would
be<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> enchantment<00:02:26.850> table<00:02:26.880> how<00:02:27.180> it's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
be like the enchantment table how it's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.760 
be like the enchantment table how it's
got<00:02:27.480> its<00:02:27.630> own<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.500> things<00:02:28.709> you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
pick from the anvil is just what is its

little plus sign and then equals you

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300 
little plus sign and then equals you
know<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.840> new<00:02:40.020> thing<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.860> it'll<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.040> cool<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
know the new thing so it'll be cool to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
know the new thing so it'll be cool to
actually<00:02:41.489> get<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> see<00:02:41.910> what<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.060> look<00:02:42.180> like

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
actually get to see what that look like

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.150 
actually get to see what that look like
and<00:02:42.570> since<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.200> say<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.890> i'm

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
and since I say it like this i'm

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040 
and since I say it like this i'm
guessing<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.850> different<00:02:45.270> than<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.720> pc

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
guessing is can be different than the pc

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.660 
guessing is can be different than the pc
version<00:02:46.080> otherwise<00:02:46.680> how<00:02:47.130> did<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:47.520> really

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
version otherwise how did they really

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
version otherwise how did they really
bring<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.060> up<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.840> gonna<00:02:48.959> look<00:02:49.080> exactly

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
bring it up if it's gonna look exactly

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.110 
bring it up if it's gonna look exactly
the<00:02:49.680> same<00:02:49.770> as<00:02:50.010> pc<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.550> everybody's<00:02:50.970> gonna

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the same as pc because everybody's gonna

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850 
the same as pc because everybody's gonna
look<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.320> can<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.440> pretty<00:02:52.650> cool

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
look that up so that can be pretty cool

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.370 
look that up so that can be pretty cool
if<00:02:52.920> they<00:02:53.280> custom<00:02:53.730> make<00:02:53.910> one's<00:02:54.300> for<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.750> 360

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
if they custom make one's for the 360

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.680 
if they custom make one's for the 360
and<00:02:55.709> for<00:02:55.920> playstation<00:02:56.310> 3<00:02:56.519> okay<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.660> is

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
and for playstation 3 okay so that is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.060
