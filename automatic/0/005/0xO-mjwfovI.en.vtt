00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:10.370
 the gear cycle continues and make a series 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.070
 himself with his clumsy little hands 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.340
 then I'll tell you how 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:23.180
 it turns out the chain of cardinal here from such 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:29.160
 ordinary at first glance ringlets 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:32.399
 here are karinka twisted ha ha ha well and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.829
 a small set of tools which 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.230
 called in the beak 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.500
 tweezers zhigalko solder feed 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 the burner itself the most important thing is me 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.610
 showed last time only happens 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:54.410
 so take two clicks take just such 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 little ring little ring here close the little ring 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.809
 repeat these four times two ringlet with 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.280
 one side two ringlet on the other 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.979
 parties here we have a beautiful jar with 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.979
 muddy flux led 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.289
 some dark liquid incomprehensible 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.289

 such 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.100
 then all this plus is laid out 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.060
 ringlets fugue m fan fugue this place 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.149
 soldering is called 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.079
 for this we use terrific 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.110
 titanium tweezers are very comfortable in 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.590
 using 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.560
 so dacha shorter lighter burner 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.369
 gasoline solder burner here 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.069
 such a thing 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.750
 m is gold just as well like this 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.209
 specially made much faster 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:10.769
 melts than just 585 sample 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:17.340
 such a golden surf we heat brandy 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.340
 once soldered 2 solder 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:30.120
 warmed the second end well, as in any 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:34.230
 rope two ends two rings up 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.710
 soldered and soldered 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.870
 that's about the ends and ring ring fu 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.880
 such a chain of 60 centimeters I 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.570
 counted it turns out eight hundred forty pieces 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.960
 that is, only 840 rations I am now 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.180
 produced four of them and by and large 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.300
 account 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.700
 not bad goal called cardinal

 practically in your pocket and who after that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.300
