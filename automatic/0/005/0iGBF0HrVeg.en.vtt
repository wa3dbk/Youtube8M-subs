x-ray<00:00:49.590> images<00:00:50.039> pretty<00:00:50.879> spooky<00:00:51.300> stuff<00:00:51.510> eh

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
x-ray images pretty spooky stuff eh

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.650 
x-ray images pretty spooky stuff eh
actually<00:00:53.520> I've<00:00:53.730> already<00:00:54.000> explained<00:00:54.480> what

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
actually I've already explained what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
actually I've already explained what
this<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.680> earlier<00:00:55.980> videos<00:00:56.660> but

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this is in some of my earlier videos but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.270 
this is in some of my earlier videos but
as<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> hubbub<00:00:58.230> continues<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
as the hubbub continues I thought I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
as the hubbub continues I thought I
should<00:00:59.430> feature<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.329> video<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
should feature it in a video when the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
should feature it in a video when the
Sun<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.739> too<00:01:01.890> active<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.520> today<00:01:02.850> as

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
Sun is not too active like today as

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
Sun is not too active like today as
always<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.470> first<00:01:04.739> approach<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.159> problem<00:01:05.280> by

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
always I first approach a problem by

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
always I first approach a problem by
gathering<00:01:06.060> data<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.619> what

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
gathering data about it and see what

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
gathering data about it and see what
back<00:01:07.979> data<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.520> tell<00:01:08.729> us<00:01:09.619> first<00:01:10.619> let's<00:01:10.799> look

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
back data can tell us first let's look

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
back data can tell us first let's look
at<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> sequence<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> images<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.330> today's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
at a sequence of images of today's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
at a sequence of images of today's
passage<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.830> mysterious<00:01:14.159> object<00:01:15.590> at<00:01:16.590> 621

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
passage of the mysterious object at 621

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
passage of the mysterious object at 621
UT<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.030> no<00:01:18.150> sign<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> object<00:01:19.080> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
UT there is no sign of the object but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.230 
UT there is no sign of the object but
just<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.890> minute<00:01:20.070> later<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> Sun<00:01:20.790> starts<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
just one minute later the Sun starts to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
just one minute later the Sun starts to
disappear<00:01:21.979> within<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.280> minutes<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
disappear within two minutes it is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.230 
disappear within two minutes it is
completely<00:01:24.210> gone<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.729> from<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.030> we've

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
completely gone so from this we've

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
completely gone so from this we've
established<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.350> takes<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.710> two<00:01:29.009> minutes

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
established it takes about two minutes

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.060 
established it takes about two minutes
for<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.520> object<00:01:29.640> across<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> solar<00:01:30.420> disk

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
for the object across the solar disk

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.940 
for the object across the solar disk
remember<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.729> useful<00:01:33.090> later<00:01:33.950> now

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
remember that for it be useful later now

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
remember that for it be useful later now
let's<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.369> long<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.820> sdl<00:01:36.180> satellite<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
let's see how long the sdl satellite is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.039 
let's see how long the sdl satellite is
in<00:01:36.869> shadow<00:01:38.030> at<00:01:39.030> seven-thirty<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> Sun

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
in shadow at seven-thirty for the Sun

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.859 
in shadow at seven-thirty for the Sun
starts<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> reappear<00:01:40.920> by<00:01:41.549> 736<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> object<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
starts to reappear by 736 the object is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.370 
starts to reappear by 736 the object is
moved<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.180> takes<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.540> 73<00:01:46.140> minutes

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
moved on so it takes about 73 minutes

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
moved on so it takes about 73 minutes

for this sdl spacecraft traverse the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.679 
for this sdl spacecraft traverse the
shadow<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> object<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> use<00:01:51.420> this

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
shadow of the object we can use this

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.940 
shadow of the object we can use this
information<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.259> work<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> approximate

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
information to work out the approximate

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.690 
just had South Pole is tilted towards
the Sun<00:04:06.740> because<00:04:07.740> of<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> size<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.340> tilt<00:04:08.580> of
