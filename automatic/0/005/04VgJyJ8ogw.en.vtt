it's sort of almost choking waterways
its<00:00:55.140> seeds<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.980> seeds<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.550> taken<00:00:57.180> away<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
its seeds the seeds get taken away on

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970 
its seeds the seeds get taken away on
the<00:00:57.629> wind<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:58.079> something<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.680> seeds

the wind or something and it's seeds

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.729 
the wind or something and it's seeds
itself<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> away<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.449> always<00:01:01.140> oh

no no it's not it's from Brazil
originally<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.799> actually<00:01:05.010> become<00:01:05.489> an

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
originally so it's actually become an

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.080 
originally so it's actually become an
invasive<00:01:05.880> species<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.380> looks<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.130> far

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
looking for a sort of anaconda to come

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.560 
looking for a sort of anaconda to come
out<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> strangle<00:01:21.509> or<00:01:21.570> something<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:24.270> fun

to see it's growing here if it's I mean
just<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> conservation<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> says

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
just for the conservation it says

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
just for the conservation it says
protects<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> roots<00:01:31.979> these<00:01:32.220> leaves<00:01:32.490> has<00:01:32.729> i

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
protects the roots these leaves has i

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:42.969 
protects the roots these leaves has i
back<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> wind

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:02:02.120 

but<00:01:43.979> obviously<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.580> West<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.939> Ireland<00:02:01.130> like

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
but obviously the West of Ireland like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.919 
but obviously the West of Ireland like
it's<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.549> something<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> plant<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:03.720> if

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
it's not something you plant now if

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.389 
it's not something you plant now if
you've<00:02:04.080> got<00:02:04.110> kids<00:02:04.560> running<00:02:04.860> around<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you've got kids running around the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.100 
you've got kids running around the
garden<00:02:05.580> they'd<00:02:05.970> be<00:02:06.119> screaming<00:02:06.720> getting

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
garden they'd be screaming getting

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
garden they'd be screaming getting
themselves<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.890> mean<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.610> damage<00:02:08.789> diamond<00:02:09.330> for

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
themselves I mean the damage diamond for

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.820 
themselves I mean the damage diamond for
them<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.810> sort<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.019> hide<00:02:10.200> under<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> leaves

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
them to sort of hide under the leaves

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.970 
them to sort of hide under the leaves
but<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.580> spiky<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:13.019> janila

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
invasive quality and you know when you

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.729 
invasive quality and you know when you
push<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.930> approach<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.590> can

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
