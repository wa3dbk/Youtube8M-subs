00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.760
 It is lying there because the card was a 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.340
 book that completely amazed me 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.030
 so I also left the field for everything

 You liked it a lot and it was recommended by 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.400
 another person for this item I chose 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 how to marry a fallen wedge that 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.140

 twin the word books and fuxicos she me 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.890
 said that this book before the series the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.280
 deputy director nuno andrÃ© rabbit was released 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.100
 in Brazil and I would open reading I was a 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.380
 them too 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.950
 tasty to read it has a humor 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.620
 ironic has a girl in front of him 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.260
 In your time you have a novel that is a 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.210
 Yes, the accompanying delight is a great 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.480
 example of jk Rowling books was 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.420
 my first banking novel and finally I 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.670
 really loved the next item is also 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.410
 a book you read before creating your 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.570
 channel on youtube and of which not yet 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.580
 said on video she'll finish 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.230
 indicating a book that I do not have here 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.030
 I remember it before the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.460
 and I borrowed it and it was the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.930
 pact from where you stayed for a book that 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.560
 when it came on my list of 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.940
 That's what left me so 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.530
 anguished that I remember they had 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.750
 party, he had to move to the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 below the book because the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.460
 that if I could not hold the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.550
 anxiety and want to jump to read 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.010
 happened and it was the book I found 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.530
 extremely well-architected well 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.360
 developed a complex letter I 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.670
 legal film will deal with a 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.650
 A very delicate matter is two boyfriends. 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.040
 The girl eventually passed away. 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.980
 The boy survives and they discover that 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.960
 they had made a pact to kill themselves 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.180
 together just for the boy it's over 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.130
 surviving and all clues indicate 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.770
 that he killed the girl then the families 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.570
 who were extremely friendly, they end up 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.700
 becoming rivals in court because the 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.780
 girl's family is accusing the boy 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.580
 of murder 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.980
 finally, history will develop a 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.630
 extremely complex way has all the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.790
 an equally psychological question 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.800
 involved in the plot is ultimately a 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.490
 great that I recommend too much for 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.890
 you 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.900
 the next item is over made a book that 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.420
 You do not intend to relief me. 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.130
 could choose several titles to and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.660
 Yes, I understand why I think most 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.640
 of the books I have do not have to 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.650
 re-election because I already have 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.690
 many books not linked to activists 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.640
 if I go to read the books I've read 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.600
 I'll never be able to read the ones I 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.520
 I have not read it yet 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.450
 although there are some that I want yes 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.010
 read it again and then I ended up choosing 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.840
 to write a book that I think 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.400
 I do not usually talk here on the non-channel. 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.100
 I wanted to take anything you've heard 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.960
 talk a lot because the book proposes 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.950
 irrefutable frog 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.810
 I remember that at the time 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.000
 I read I was extremely anxious to 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.970
 reading so many good comments 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.860
 I heard about him a chick lit and that ends 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.470
 disappointing me with the reading I did not find 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.840
 that book was all this I found humor 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.420
 I really did not like the protagonist. 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.360
 I did not like how the story gets 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.280
 it developed so it was not so much 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.320
 bad and it was a book was not our worst 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.930
 level of the year but also was not a 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.010
 reading that I thought flies looked good on 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.290
 half term 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.420
 but less that more I still 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.630
 I want to say, Doctor, I have it here. 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.060
 I have not read but at last a book that 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.250
 A lot of people spoke well and I ended up 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.920
 disappointed and I do not feel like 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.320
 read again the next book instagram one 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.010
 book with a beautiful cover or book 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.870
 photogenic for this item I chose where 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.720
 I left my heart that for me was a 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.300
 of the most beautiful covers of 2014 I found 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.060
 a beautiful book not only by his cover but 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.220
 all the recording the color choice I found 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.310
 It was of extreme good taste as you 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.080
 can you see afi with me that I found? 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.290

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.310

 cinema also has several books that 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.820
 I would like to see fit for the cinema 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.670

 I delighted I loved it with a 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.000
 story developed I loved the novel 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.760

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.330
