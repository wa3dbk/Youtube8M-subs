really<00:01:20.509> cool<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.020> like<00:01:21.170> when<00:01:21.350> two<00:01:21.499> reasons

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
really cool so I like when two reasons

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.309 
really cool so I like when two reasons
you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:23.030> see<00:01:23.179> next<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.569> search<00:01:23.780> bar<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:24.200> have

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
you can see next to search bar we have

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.529 
you can see next to search bar we have
that<00:01:24.439> little<00:01:24.590> X<00:01:24.859> and<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.729> X<00:01:25.969> is<00:01:26.090> declare<00:01:26.450> are

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
that little X and that X is declare are

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.510 
that little X and that X is declare are
your<00:01:26.689> open<00:01:26.960> applications<00:01:27.560> but<00:01:28.039> I<00:01:28.069> like<00:01:28.280> how<00:01:28.399> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
your open applications but I like how it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.399 
your open applications but I like how it
has<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.640> material<00:01:29.179> design<00:01:29.420> twist<00:01:29.749> on<00:01:29.929> it<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.350> if

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
has a material design twist on it so if

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.590 
has a material design twist on it so if
you<00:01:30.499> tap<00:01:30.710> on<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.759> get<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.030> cool<00:01:32.240> ripple

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
you tap on it you get that cool ripple

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.090 
you tap on it you get that cool ripple
effect<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.439> goes<00:01:33.560> ahead<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.889> clear<00:01:34.069> out

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
effect and it goes ahead and clear out

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.489 
effect and it goes ahead and clear out
all<00:01:34.219> the<00:01:34.399> applications<00:01:34.869> again<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.109> a<00:01:36.229> small

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
all the applications again it's a small

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.679 
all the applications again it's a small
detail<00:01:36.979> but<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.609> looks<00:01:37.789> pretty<00:01:37.850> awesome<00:01:38.270> I

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
detail but it looks pretty awesome I

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.569 
detail but it looks pretty awesome I
prefer<00:01:39.109> it<00:01:39.409> way<00:01:39.530> better<00:01:39.710> than<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.069> staircase

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
prefer it way better than the staircase

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.669 
prefer it way better than the staircase

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
not present here on oxygen OS so it'll

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.340 
not present here on oxygen OS so it'll
be<00:04:42.730> really<00:04:42.790> cool<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.480> toggle<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.140> off

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.420 
instead of using cm12 you're gonna use
