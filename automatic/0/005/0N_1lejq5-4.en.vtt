00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.860
 teacher strokes has passed 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.240
 since albert einstein published the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.640
 general relativity 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.490
 how great was the intuition of 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.250
 einstein immense and more than they 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.240
 himself could imagine einstein 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.760
 makes a solitary journey in order to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.640
 understand some aspects a lot 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.300
 deep of nature trying to 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.030
 overcome some inconsistencies that end 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.399
 of the nineteenth century they emerged among mechanics 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.430
 classical and einstein electromagnetism 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.500
 unifies gravity and light and formulates the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.469
 general relativity a theory 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 mathematics of immense elegance and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.640
 beauty with which we today a hundred 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.670
 years away 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.030
 we describe the physical reality what 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.850
 it's gravity and light gravity gives weight 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.610
 to the bodies here on earth but it is also 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.729
 responsible for the curvilinear motions of the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.670
 planets around the sun of the moons 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.799
 around the planets of the stars in the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.060
 galaxies gravity, anywhere 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.409
 in the universe and by newton gravity is 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.640
 a distance force that is transmitted 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.939
 instantly with a speed 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.340
 infinite between the various bodies in the light 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.630
 a swing of the field 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.570
 electromagnetic and propagates one 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.229
 speed over 300,000 kilometers per 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.689
 second 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.840
 regulates the interaction between charges 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:45.170
 electric and is an example of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.119
 an interaction that takes place a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.390
 speed over 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.750
 einstein understands that this is a limit 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.969
 impassable any information can 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 a lower speed be transmitted 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.399
 or at the most equal to the speed of light 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.880
 and then what is gravity per 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.909
 einstein the earth moves around the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.090
 sun for einstein the earth moves 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.989
 along a straight straight path 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.420
 within a curved space and the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.350
 warp is caused by the gravity of the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.069
 Sun 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.969
 einstein tells us that 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.540
 matter curves space and space 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:31.370
 tells the subject how to move 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.980
 gravity and geometry gravity is 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.459
 curvature of space time gravity 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.069
 also the time curve and where the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.829
 warp is more extreme 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.510
 time passes more slowly in this 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:51.079
 space time curved also the light follows 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.760
 curvilinear trajectories of gravity 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.489
 change the propagation path 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.560
 of light as has been demonstrated 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.719
 predictions of einstein 's predictions 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.689
 of general relativity have been 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:06.959
 verified with extraordinary precision 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.519
 but einstein's triumph occurs in 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.989
 time when sir arthur eddington 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.989
 measures the deflection of the light during 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.989
 a solar eclipse in 1920
