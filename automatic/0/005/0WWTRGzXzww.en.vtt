00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
ski i think and then because i know

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.879 
ski i think and then because i know
there's<00:02:57.630> Rico<00:02:58.109> skipper<00:02:59.209> right<00:03:00.209> skipper<00:03:00.889> Rico

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
there's Rico skipper right skipper Rico

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.879 
there's Rico skipper right skipper Rico
private<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.000> cost<00:03:03.660> get<00:03:03.930> ready<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.440> smart<00:03:04.709> one

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
private and cost get ready the smart one
