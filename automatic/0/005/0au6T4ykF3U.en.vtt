00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.690
 serious problem that could have

 You're open the device if I 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.160

 then the water inside it all to him 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.370

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.240

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.230

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.680
 to the cellphone 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.330
 they reported that the very own 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 authorized here of curitiba could 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.290
 do the repair for me because I believe 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.020
 which will only come with a special glue 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.500
 Because it does not close, it does not close on foot. 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.780
 he abandoned by pressing 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.990
 soon after he was back 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.880
 is not prohibited and I will not have any 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.620

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.420

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.080
 I will lose my device warranty 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.780
 I was allowed here in Curitiba. 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.150
 again in their word that they 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.250
 They said that you have to send SÃ£o Paulo. 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.400
 again authorized sony accurate 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.709
 make this seal the first time and 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.660
 around 20 this appliance and which is a 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.580
 tool and I will stay if the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.709
 do it again to not lose the warranty 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.090
 spoke of 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.630
 today everything is here of the device that 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.459
 came back repaired the last ball that the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.760
 sony is doing a lack of respect 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.209
 is a device that is to be top of 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.670
 line happens this kind of thing and does not 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.290
 authorized and that my indignation 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.150
 because I came back to stay 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.640
 probably another 20 days to send 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.560
 get out of here without the working tool 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.739
 I'm feeling hurt by sony. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.660
 Undoubtedly it is the form of knots. 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.720
 consumers are focused on 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.640
 especially this disregard and one 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.250
 damaged battery 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.989
 he has already returned with a problem 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.480
 which could have resulted in the loss 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.250
 but in its own way this device 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.750
 they were going to get it now and it probably will. 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.730
 lose the guarantee that forgives 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.210
 the device does not indemnify me did not understand 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.430
 to him now I'll stay there more 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.360
 some days without a cell phone 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.360
 I think this is it guys
