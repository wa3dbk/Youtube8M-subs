of this kind of navigation system based

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.600 
of this kind of navigation system based
on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> processing<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.190> location<00:00:53.190> signals

there will be more accurate for the

there will be more accurate for the

kinds of navigation system runs

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.850 
kinds of navigation system runs
certainly<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:21.060> different<00:01:21.450> countries<00:01:21.860> well

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860

certainly by different countries well
the<00:01:22.979> first<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.729> important<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the first thing that's important is that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
the first thing that's important is that
each<00:01:25.140> system<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.549> operate<00:01:26.970> without

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
each system can operate without

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
each system can operate without
interfering<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> other<00:01:28.290> systems<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
interfering with the other systems and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.890 
interfering with the other systems and
that's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.520> principle<00:01:29.700> which<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.240> broadly

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that's a principle which is broadly

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
that's a principle which is broadly
accepted<00:01:31.380> which<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.680> good<00:01:31.890> much<00:01:32.549> better<00:01:32.820> than

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
accepted which is good much better than

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.330 
accepted which is good much better than
that<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> signals<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.619> multiple

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that is if the signals from multiple

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.280 
that is if the signals from multiple
constellations<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.720> measured<00:01:37.140> by<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
constellations can be measured by a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.490 
constellations can be measured by a
single<00:01:37.710> receiver<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.280> single<00:01:38.640> device<00:01:38.909> then

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
single receiver a single device then

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
single receiver a single device then
then<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.770> consumer<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.579> scientists<00:01:42.540> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
then the consumer and scientists can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
then the consumer and scientists can
make<00:01:43.640> imaginative<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.210> combination

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
make imaginative use of that combination

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
make imaginative use of that combination
of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> satellite<00:01:46.439> signals<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.570> therefore

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
of the satellite signals and therefore

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
of the satellite signals and therefore
is<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:49.200> possibility<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.979> cooperation<00:01:50.490> is

is there possibility for cooperation is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.819 
is there possibility for cooperation is

that already on the horizon professor

it's<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.009> broadly<00:01:56.490> accepted<00:01:56.880> principle

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

things to work against each other but

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
things to work against each other but
because<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.420> difficult<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:04.020> people

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
because it's difficult because people

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950 
because it's difficult because people
want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> best<00:02:05.820> possible<00:02:06.030> orbits<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
want to get the best possible orbits and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.589 
want to get the best possible orbits and
get<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> best<00:02:07.469> possible<00:02:07.710> signals<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.360> far

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
get the best possible signals but so far

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.089 
get the best possible signals but so far
the<00:02:09.780> story<00:02:09.989> looks<00:02:10.259> good<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> future<00:02:10.920> looks

civil point of view absolutely the more
systems<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.329> are<00:02:24.359> in<00:02:24.540> orbit<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> better<00:02:25.109> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
systems there are in orbit the better it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.929 
systems there are in orbit the better it
is<00:02:25.349> for<00:02:25.409> all<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.950> users<00:02:26.280> around<00:02:26.609> the<00:02:26.760> world

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
is for all the users around the world

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.199 
is for all the users around the world
including<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.510> China<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:28.109> the<00:02:28.170> United<00:02:28.290> States

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
including in China and the United States

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.660 
including in China and the United States
from<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.269> military<00:02:30.689> point<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.079> view<00:02:31.139> and

from a military point of view and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.500 
from a military point of view and
hopefully<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.969> something<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.299> will

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
hopefully this is something that will

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.119 
hopefully this is something that will
never<00:02:33.689> happen<00:02:33.959> but<00:02:34.319> if<00:02:34.379> there<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> conflict

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
never happen but if there is a conflict

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.039 
never happen but if there is a conflict
between<00:02:35.250> countries<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.060> own<00:02:36.359> these<00:02:36.599> systems

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
between countries that own these systems

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.890 
between countries that own these systems
then<00:02:37.829> that<00:02:38.040> might<00:02:38.219> be<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> different<00:02:38.790> story<00:02:38.900> at

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
then that might be a different story at

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720 
then that might be a different story at
this<00:02:40.109> moment<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.620> want<00:02:40.799> your<00:02:41.099> comment<00:02:41.489> sir

latest bado satellites are indeed made
in<00:03:28.919> China<00:03:29.189> than<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:29.639> immense<00:03:30.329> progress

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
in China than that's immense progress

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.809 
in China than that's immense progress

Sheldon<00:03:37.680> mentioned<00:03:38.129> something<00:03:38.459> about<00:03:38.579> the

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
Sheldon mentioned something about the

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.270 
Sheldon mentioned something about the
dual<00:03:39.090> use<00:03:39.389> one<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.930> about<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.349> military<00:03:40.829> uses

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
dual use one is about the military uses

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.869 
dual use one is about the military uses
so<00:03:41.459> how<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.680> China<00:03:43.680> going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.400> look<00:03:44.609> at<00:03:44.759> the

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
so how is China going to look at the

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.789 
so how is China going to look at the
issue<00:03:45.060> well<00:03:45.329> developing<00:03:45.959> his<00:03:46.109> navigation

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
issue well developing his navigation

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.439 
issue well developing his navigation
system<00:03:47.220> while<00:03:47.370> others<00:03:47.729> are<00:03:47.939> observing<00:03:48.419> very

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
system while others are observing very

closely as to which area where China

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.649 
closely as to which area where China
touch<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.959> mr.<00:03:52.530> young<00:03:52.909> well<00:03:53.909> of<00:03:54.030> course<00:03:54.090> there

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
touch on mr. young well of course there

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.619 
touch on mr. young well of course there
are<00:03:54.840> both<00:03:55.379> military<00:03:55.979> and<00:03:56.090> civil<00:03:57.090> use<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.509> the

are both military and civil use of the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.229 
are both military and civil use of the
navigation<00:03:58.109> system<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:58.969> worldwide<00:03:59.969> of

navigation system but worldwide of
course<00:04:00.479> it<00:04:00.599> is<00:04:00.780> true<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.139> every<00:04:01.459> country<00:04:02.459> have

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
course it is true for every country have

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.550 
course it is true for every country have
this<00:04:02.759> but<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.030> should<00:04:03.359> emphasize<00:04:03.719> that<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:04.530> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
this but I should emphasize that for a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.129 
this but I should emphasize that for a
big<00:04:04.739> country<00:04:04.979> like<00:04:05.400> China<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.419> must<00:04:06.689> have<00:04:06.930> its

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.080 
big country like China it must have its
own<00:04:07.290> navigation<00:04:07.739> system<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:08.669> is<00:04:08.879> very

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
own navigation system this is very

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.020 
own navigation system this is very
important<00:04:09.569> for<00:04:10.259> the<00:04:10.439> security<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.979> the<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.849> the

country's country you can see that

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.899 
country's country you can see that
post-american<00:04:15.209> both<00:04:15.840> Russia<00:04:16.409> and<00:04:16.739> even<00:04:17.370> India

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.849 
post-american both Russia and even India
have<00:04:18.329> his<00:04:18.479> own<00:04:18.750> navigation<00:04:18.989> system<00:04:19.620> although

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
have his own navigation system although

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
have his own navigation system although
some<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.070> them<00:04:20.310> are<00:04:20.549> global<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.299> some<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:21.659> the

regional enhancement of
GPS<00:04:26.580> signals<00:04:26.940> so<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.540> can<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.200> say<00:04:28.380> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
GPS signals so you can you can say that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.580 
GPS signals so you can you can say that
it<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.190> necessary<00:04:29.790> for<00:04:29.970> every<00:04:30.090> country<00:04:30.590> at

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
it is necessary for every country at

system well at the same time you look at

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.910 
system well at the same time you look at
China's<00:04:53.790> counterpart<00:04:54.360> NASA<00:04:54.690> for<00:04:55.050> example<00:04:55.500> yes

in Washington talking recently about the
outer<00:04:59.010> space<00:04:59.520> exploration<00:05:00.300> pretty<00:05:00.690> much<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
outer space exploration pretty much of a

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.590 
outer space exploration pretty much of a
romantic<00:05:01.710> description<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:03.300> know<00:05:03.420> the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
romantic description of the you know the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.110 
romantic description of the you know the
nephews<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.320> so-called<00:05:04.920> in<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.880> outer

space

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.400 
space
so<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.730> seems<00:05:09.450> at<00:05:09.780> least<00:05:09.990> apparently

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
so it seems at least apparently

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.520 
so it seems at least apparently
different<00:05:11.370> countries<00:05:12.120> are<00:05:12.530> communicating

a<00:05:18.180> very<00:05:18.480> different<00:05:18.960> way<00:05:19.080> what<00:05:19.290> do<00:05:19.410> you<00:05:19.500> think

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
a very different way what do you think

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.800 
a very different way what do you think
about<00:05:19.950> these<00:05:20.100> different<00:05:20.370> approaches<00:05:21.300> how

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
about these different approaches how

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.830 
about these different approaches how
much<00:05:22.050> does<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.350> represent<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:23.840> generational

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
much does it represent a generational

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.040 
much does it represent a generational
difference<00:05:25.320> in<00:05:25.470> terms<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.220> technological

difference in terms of the technological
levels<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.460> what<00:05:29.460> does<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.730> mean<00:05:30.240> for<00:05:30.990> the

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
levels and what does it mean for the

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.730 
levels and what does it mean for the
future<00:05:31.940> chosen<00:05:32.940> path<00:05:33.240> might<00:05:33.840> be<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.230> these

from<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.750> first

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
from you first

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.650 
from you first
well<00:05:37.560> I've<00:05:37.800> mentioned<00:05:38.280> before<00:05:38.670> that<00:05:38.700> china<00:05:39.420> is

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
well I've mentioned before that china is

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.140 
well I've mentioned before that china is
still<00:05:39.690> developing<00:05:40.170> country<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.880> also<00:05:41.880> I

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
still developing country and also I

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.550 
still developing country and also I
mentioned<00:05:42.540> that<00:05:42.690> there<00:05:42.900> are<00:05:42.930> direct<00:05:43.410> and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
mentioned that there are direct and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.220 
mentioned that there are direct and
indirect<00:05:44.160> report<00:05:44.580> from<00:05:45.330> space<00:05:45.660> technology

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
indirect report from space technology

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.080 
indirect report from space technology
for<00:05:46.440> China<00:05:46.650> because<00:05:47.100> we<00:05:47.490> still<00:05:47.700> have<00:05:47.880> a<00:05:47.910> long

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
for China because we still have a long

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.960 
for China because we still have a long
way<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.330> go<00:05:48.480> and<00:05:48.690> still<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.890> United<00:05:50.100> States<00:05:50.550> is

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
way to go and still the United States is

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.520 
way to go and still the United States is
now<00:05:51.180> placed<00:05:51.660> a<00:05:51.840> leading<00:05:52.170> role<00:05:52.350> in<00:05:52.470> space

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
now placed a leading role in space

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.950 
now placed a leading role in space
technology<00:05:52.920> we<00:05:53.670> still<00:05:53.910> have<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.180> very<00:05:54.480> long<00:05:54.780> way

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
technology we still have a very long way

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.480 
technology we still have a very long way
to<00:05:55.230> go<00:05:55.350> to<00:05:55.410> catch<00:05:55.620> up<00:05:55.830> with<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.100> United<00:05:56.460> States

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
to go to catch up with the United States

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.330 
to go to catch up with the United States
so<00:05:57.060> at<00:05:57.630> current<00:05:58.020> stage<00:05:58.230> I<00:05:58.470> think<00:05:58.680> it<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:58.950> a<00:05:58.980> wise

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
so at current stage I think it is a wise

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.720 
so at current stage I think it is a wise
choice<00:05:59.400> for<00:06:00.030> us<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.680> invest<00:06:01.680> money<00:06:01.890> on<00:06:02.190> those

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
choice for us to invest money on those

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.450 
choice for us to invest money on those
projects<00:06:03.180> which<00:06:03.420> can<00:06:03.660> have<00:06:03.930> many<00:06:04.290> much<00:06:05.190> more

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
projects which can have many much more

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.930 
projects which can have many much more
more<00:06:06.090> direct<00:06:06.870> reward<00:06:07.440> from<00:06:07.710> from<00:06:08.040> it<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.430> also

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
more direct reward from from it and also

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.080 
more direct reward from from it and also
we<00:06:09.270> should<00:06:09.920> develop<00:06:10.920> the<00:06:10.950> technology<00:06:11.880> which

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
we should develop the technology which

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.750 
we should develop the technology which
is<00:06:12.270> not<00:06:12.450> very<00:06:12.840> not<00:06:13.530> too<00:06:13.560> difficult<00:06:13.980> for<00:06:14.250> us<00:06:14.520> at

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
is not very not too difficult for us at

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.670 
is not very not too difficult for us at

like<00:06:20.850> to<00:06:21.410> say<00:06:22.410> what<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.560> great<00:06:22.830> idea<00:06:22.980> it<00:06:23.190> is<00:06:23.370> for

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
like to say what a great idea it is for

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.140 
like to say what a great idea it is for
China<00:06:23.850> to<00:06:24.090> develop<00:06:24.210> they<00:06:24.540> do<00:06:24.720> since<00:06:25.700> 2007<00:06:26.700> more

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
China to develop they do since 2007 more

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.070 
in cities and it's difficult to navigate
and<00:06:32.130> find<00:06:32.280> your<00:06:32.640> way<00:06:32.730> around<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:33.240> city<00:06:33.420> but<00:06:33.990> if

and find your way around a city but if

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.659 
and find your way around a city but if

it's a true
you're<00:06:39.160> straightforward<00:06:39.790> thing<00:06:40.000> to<00:06:40.210> do<00:06:40.390> so<00:06:41.050> I

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
you're straightforward thing to do so I

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.510 
you're straightforward thing to do so I
think<00:06:41.380> it's<00:06:41.620> important<00:06:42.040> for<00:06:42.070> China's

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
think it's important for China's

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.270 
think it's important for China's
sovereignty<00:06:43.450> to<00:06:44.020> be<00:06:44.140> able<00:06:44.260> to<00:06:44.410> rely<00:06:44.950> upon<00:06:44.980> a

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
sovereignty to be able to rely upon a

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.400 
sovereignty to be able to rely upon a
system<00:06:45.490> that<00:06:45.940> it<00:06:46.090> can<00:06:46.270> develop<00:06:46.420> and<00:06:46.840> then<00:06:47.290> it

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
system that it can develop and then it

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.190 
system that it can develop and then it
can<00:06:47.650> plan<00:06:48.420> economic<00:06:49.420> development<00:06:49.930> around

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
can plan economic development around

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.730 
can plan economic development around
availability<00:06:50.950> of<00:06:51.040> those<00:06:51.130> signals<00:06:51.550> so<00:06:52.680> it's<00:06:53.680> a

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
availability of those signals so it's a

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.140 
availability of those signals so it's a
very<00:06:53.920> good<00:06:54.070> thing<00:06:54.130> developing<00:06:54.670> Bo<00:06:54.790> do<00:06:54.940> for

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
very good thing developing Bo do for

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.050 
very good thing developing Bo do for
sure<00:06:55.180> then<00:06:55.840> beyond<00:06:56.230> that<00:06:56.700> China<00:06:57.700> is<00:06:57.850> a<00:06:57.880> country

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
sure then beyond that China is a country

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.110 
sure then beyond that China is a country
with<00:06:58.510> vast<00:06:59.500> natural<00:07:00.130> resources<00:07:00.160> a<00:07:00.730> huge

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
with vast natural resources a huge

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.150 
with vast natural resources a huge
population<00:07:01.600> a<00:07:01.960> huge<00:07:02.230> land<00:07:02.560> mass<00:07:02.680> and

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
population a huge land mass and

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.820 
population a huge land mass and
sometimes<00:07:04.000> some<00:07:04.270> difficult<00:07:05.110> environmental

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
sometimes some difficult environmental

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.160 
sometimes some difficult environmental
conditions<00:07:06.220> like<00:07:06.430> earthquakes<00:07:06.970> so<00:07:07.480> space

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
conditions like earthquakes so space

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.140 
conditions like earthquakes so space
technology<00:07:08.710> can<00:07:08.920> help<00:07:09.130> solve<00:07:09.430> all<00:07:09.760> those

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
technology can help solve all those

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.360 
technology can help solve all those
problems<00:07:10.210> and<00:07:10.960> I<00:07:11.110> think<00:07:11.140> China<00:07:11.590> will<00:07:11.800> find<00:07:12.070> its

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
problems and I think China will find its

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.970 
problems and I think China will find its
own<00:07:12.790> distinctive<00:07:13.620> solutions<00:07:14.620> to<00:07:14.890> those

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
own distinctive solutions to those

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.250 
own distinctive solutions to those
problems<00:07:15.040> through<00:07:16.030> having<00:07:16.420> assets<00:07:16.630> in<00:07:16.990> space

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
problems through having assets in space

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.790 
problems through having assets in space
hmm<00:07:18.040> dr.<00:07:18.940> Sheldon<00:07:19.390> what<00:07:19.570> do<00:07:19.720> you<00:07:19.900> make<00:07:20.080> of<00:07:20.140> it<00:07:20.560> I

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
hmm dr. Sheldon what do you make of it I

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.710 
hmm dr. Sheldon what do you make of it I
mean<00:07:21.130> the<00:07:21.250> different<00:07:21.610> approaches<00:07:22.180> apparently

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
mean the different approaches apparently

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.320 
mean the different approaches apparently
at<00:07:22.870> least<00:07:22.900> by<00:07:23.860> China<00:07:24.250> and<00:07:24.400> the<00:07:24.640> United<00:07:24.790> States

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
at least by China and the United States

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.440 
at least by China and the United States
about<00:07:25.600> what<00:07:25.900> should<00:07:26.110> be<00:07:26.170> the<00:07:26.380> next<00:07:26.710> stage<00:07:27.450> to

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
about what should be the next stage to

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.600 
about what should be the next stage to
focus<00:07:28.780> on<00:07:28.930> well<00:07:29.740> I<00:07:29.770> mean<00:07:30.130> we<00:07:30.310> have<00:07:30.460> two

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
focus on well I mean we have two

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.700 
focus on well I mean we have two
different<00:07:30.790> programs<00:07:31.360> obviously<00:07:32.080> many<00:07:32.620> of

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
different programs obviously many of

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.980 
different programs obviously many of
them<00:07:32.860> use<00:07:33.040> the<00:07:33.190> same<00:07:33.400> technologies<00:07:34.000> but<00:07:34.270> these

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
them use the same technologies but these

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.450 
them use the same technologies but these
are<00:07:35.110> two<00:07:35.260> programs<00:07:35.500> that<00:07:35.860> are<00:07:35.980> done<00:07:36.100> for<00:07:36.130> very

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460 
are two programs that are done for very

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.460 
are two programs that are done for very
different<00:07:36.580> purposes<00:07:36.790> by<00:07:37.390> and<00:07:37.540> large<00:07:37.690> we<00:07:38.290> must

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470 
different purposes by and large we must

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.530 
different purposes by and large we must
also<00:07:38.620> remember<00:07:38.950> that<00:07:39.190> you<00:07:39.730> know<00:07:39.790> China<00:07:40.180> while

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:40.540 
also remember that you know China while

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.420 
also remember that you know China while
it<00:07:40.660> is<00:07:40.780> becoming<00:07:41.020> a<00:07:41.350> very<00:07:41.380> major<00:07:41.740> space<00:07:42.130> power

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.430 
it is becoming a very major space power

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.610 
it is becoming a very major space power
is<00:07:42.550> also<00:07:42.820> a<00:07:42.850> young<00:07:43.090> space<00:07:43.390> power<00:07:43.750> the<00:07:44.290> United

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620 
is also a young space power the United

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.080 
is also a young space power the United
States<00:07:44.830> has<00:07:44.950> been<00:07:45.070> doing<00:07:45.130> this<00:07:45.460> for<00:07:45.610> over<00:07:45.640> 50

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
States has been doing this for over 50

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.960 
States has been doing this for over 50
years<00:07:46.120> so<00:07:46.930> in<00:07:47.440> many<00:07:47.620> ways<00:07:47.710> there's<00:07:48.280> a<00:07:48.310> question

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:48.970 
years so in many ways there's a question

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.840 
years so in many ways there's a question
here<00:07:49.000> of<00:07:49.270> been<00:07:49.660> there<00:07:49.870> done<00:07:49.930> that<00:07:50.580> while<00:07:51.580> at

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.850 
here of been there done that while at

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.460 
here of been there done that while at
the<00:07:51.940> same<00:07:52.150> time<00:07:52.420> though<00:07:52.660> there<00:07:52.900> is<00:07:53.110> you<00:07:53.350> know<00:07:53.440> a

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:53.470 
the same time though there is you know a

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.310 
the same time though there is you know a
lot<00:07:53.620> of<00:07:53.650> goodwill<00:07:54.010> towards<00:07:54.250> China<00:07:54.790> and<00:07:55.030> it's

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.320 
lot of goodwill towards China and it's

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.680 
lot of goodwill towards China and it's
its<00:07:56.460> achievements<00:07:57.460> and<00:07:57.580> ambitions<00:07:58.180> but<00:07:58.660> I

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:58.690 
its achievements and ambitions but I
