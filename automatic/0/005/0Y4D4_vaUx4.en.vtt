00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
right now going to look at how the lens

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.080 
right now going to look at how the lens
is<00:00:31.199> marked<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.070> will<00:00:32.219> help<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> understand

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
is marked this will help you understand

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.470 
is marked this will help you understand
lenses<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.770> sigma<00:00:35.010> lens<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.180> zoom

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
lenses so it's a sigma lens it's a zoom

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.290 
lenses so it's a sigma lens it's a zoom
lens<00:00:36.950> it's<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.100> lens<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> goes<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.790> 18

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
lens it's a lens that goes from 18

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.069 
lens it's a lens that goes from 18
millimeter<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.320> 50<00:00:40.710> millimeter<00:00:41.690> no<00:00:42.690> focal

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
length on the millimeters of events

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
length on the millimeters of events
means<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> angle<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.120> view<00:00:48.770> low<00:00:49.969> millimeter

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
means the angle of view low millimeter

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.330 
means the angle of view low millimeter
lens<00:00:51.379> would<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.559> an<00:00:52.649> angle<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> view<00:00:53.309> very

lens would have an angle of view very

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.290 
lens would have an angle of view very
wide<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:55.020> long<00:00:55.289> millimeter<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.120> would

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
wide and a long millimeter so it would

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.250 
wide and a long millimeter so it would
be<00:00:57.590> called<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.710> long<00:00:58.920> lens<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.690> 200

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
be called a long lens so here 200

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
be called a long lens so here 200
millimeter<00:01:01.710> lens<00:01:01.739> would<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:03.059> narrow

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
millimeter lens would have a very narrow

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.850 
millimeter lens would have a very narrow
angle<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.170> view<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:06.090> 2.8<00:01:06.659> means<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> maximum

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
angle of view the 2.8 means the maximum

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.600 
angle of view the 2.8 means the maximum
opening<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.909> lens<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> capable<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:11.460> what

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
opening the lens is capable of now what

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
opening the lens is capable of now what
I<00:01:11.640> mean<00:01:11.939> opening<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> lens

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
I mean opening in the lens

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.999 
I mean opening in the lens
it's<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.280> aperture<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> closes<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it's the aperture and it closes and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.240 
it's the aperture and it closes and
opens<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.710> when<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.009> particular

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
opens like that when this particular

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.130 
opens like that when this particular
lens<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> 2.8<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:23.340> widened<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.840> allows

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
lens is a 2.8 it's widened and it allows

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.690 
lens is a 2.8 it's widened and it allows
the<00:01:25.380> maximum<00:01:25.979> line<00:01:26.220> through<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> instance

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the maximum line through the instance

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
the maximum line through the instance
exd<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> type<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:31.049> lens<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
exd see is the type of lens for a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.690 
exd see is the type of lens for a
particular<00:01:32.400> camera<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.470> 67<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
particular camera and the 67 is the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600 
particular camera and the 67 is the
diameter<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:37.200> filter<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.250> fit<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
diameter of a filter that will fit the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.240 
diameter of a filter that will fit the
lens<00:01:39.409> well<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> think<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.799> pretty<00:01:41.009> clear

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
lens well I think that's pretty clear

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.010 
lens well I think that's pretty clear
now<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.470> zoom<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:44.159> marked<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> side<00:01:45.020> now

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
now the zoom is marked on the side now

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.170 
now the zoom is marked on the side now
this<00:01:46.170> turns<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.909> lenses<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
this turns and as you see the lenses the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
this turns and as you see the lenses the
lens<00:01:51.360> gets<00:01:51.570> longer<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.280> cases<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
lens gets longer in some cases on the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690 
lens gets longer in some cases on the
better<00:01:54.420> lenses<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.439> doesn't<00:01:55.799> get<00:01:55.920> longer<00:01:56.159> but

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
better lenses it doesn't get longer but

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.249 
better lenses it doesn't get longer but
what<00:01:56.790> happens<00:01:57.090> internally<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.020> would

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
what happens internally and that would

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.090 
what happens internally and that would
be<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.500> internal<00:01:58.950> zoom<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:01.350> lens<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.890> said

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
be an internal zoom this lens as we said

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.850 
be an internal zoom this lens as we said
what<00:02:02.310> goes<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.670> 18<00:02:03.560> 24<00:02:04.560> 28<00:02:05.100> 35<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.479> 50

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
what goes from 18 24 28 35 and 50

what goes from 18 24 28 35 and 50
or<00:02:07.190> anything<00:02:07.460> in<00:02:07.700> between<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.100> allows

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
or anything in between so that allows

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.600 
or anything in between so that allows
you<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.470> get<00:02:12.470> things<00:02:12.620> looking<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.400> they're

side<00:02:45.140> different<00:02:45.650> hunk<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.340> an<00:02:46.820> infinity<00:02:47.450> mark

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
side different hunk is an infinity mark

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.410 
side different hunk is an infinity mark
the<00:02:47.810> Infinity<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.010> something<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.180> far

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
the Infinity is something that is so far

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.170 
the Infinity is something that is so far
away<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.690> can't<00:02:51.140> focus<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:52.130> if<00:02:52.970> you're

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
away you can't focus on it so if you're

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.729 
away you can't focus on it so if you're
photographing<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.870> moon<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.320> will<00:02:54.440> put<00:02:54.620> it

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
photographing the moon you will put it

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.630 
photographing the moon you will put it
on<00:02:54.860> infinity<00:02:55.670> for<00:02:55.850> example<00:02:57.310> now<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.340> really

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
on infinity for example now that really

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.370 
on infinity for example now that really
is<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:58.940> markings<00:02:59.450> on<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.600> camera<00:02:59.870> on<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> lens

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
is the markings on a camera on a lens

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.160 
is the markings on a camera on a lens
now<00:03:00.709> other<00:03:01.280> other<00:03:01.730> lenses<00:03:05.080> sorry<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:07.190> marked

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
now other other lenses sorry this marked

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.590 
now other other lenses sorry this marked
now<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.890> stabilizer<00:03:10.580> now<00:03:10.910> some<00:03:11.120> lenses

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
now this is a stabilizer now some lenses

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.710 
now this is a stabilizer now some lenses
have<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.290> stabilizer<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.250> them<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:14.420> when<00:03:14.540> you're

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
have a stabilizer in them so when you're

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.500 
have a stabilizer in them so when you're
using<00:03:14.900> long<00:03:15.260> exposures<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:17.209> switch<00:03:17.480> that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
using long exposures you can switch that

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080 
using long exposures you can switch that
off<00:03:17.750> or<00:03:18.110> wrong<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:19.070> was<00:03:19.220> automatically

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
off or wrong it was automatically

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.060 
off or wrong it was automatically
stabilize<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.870> lens<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.470> lab<00:03:21.709> would<00:03:21.950> you

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
stabilize the lens so the lab would you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.780 
stabilize the lens so the lab would you
choose<00:03:22.280> longer<00:03:22.730> exposures<00:03:24.310> now<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:25.549> better

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
choose longer exposures now it's better

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.430 
choose longer exposures now it's better
to<00:03:25.970> switch<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.330> off<00:03:26.480> when<00:03:26.840> you're<00:03:27.019> working<00:03:27.320> on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
to switch it off when you're working on

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.539 
to switch it off when you're working on
a<00:03:27.500> tripod<00:03:29.290> ok<00:03:30.290> now<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:30.709> particular<00:03:30.920> lens<00:03:31.370> you

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
a tripod ok now this particular lens you

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.190 
a tripod ok now this particular lens you
see<00:03:31.760> doesn't<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.180> anything<00:03:32.390> locked<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:33.019> the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
see doesn't have anything locked in the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.229 
see doesn't have anything locked in the
lens<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:34.120> let's<00:03:35.120> change<00:03:35.750> from<00:03:36.350> type<00:03:36.620> 2<00:03:36.830> type<00:03:37.239> so

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
lens so let's change from type 2 type so

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.140 
lens so let's change from type 2 type so
now<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.510> know<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:40.100> millimeters<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
now we know that the millimeters of the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:50.380 
now we know that the millimeters of the
lens<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.720> called<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.140> focal<00:03:42.680> length<00:03:49.390> right

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
lens is called the focal length right

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.570 
lens is called the focal length right
now<00:03:50.720> let's<00:03:50.959> have<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.380> look<00:03:51.650> at<00:03:51.860> some

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
now let's have a look at some

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.509 
now let's have a look at some
photographs<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.239> demonstrate<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:55.130> cameras

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
photographs to demonstrate the cameras

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.520 
photographs to demonstrate the cameras
locked<00:03:55.940> off<00:03:56.120> on<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.330> tripod<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.140> nothing<00:03:57.440> is

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
locked off on a tripod so nothing is

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.590 
locked off on a tripod so nothing is
moved<00:03:57.769> between<00:03:57.950> these<00:03:58.280> photographs<00:03:58.820> this<00:03:59.390> is

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
moved between these photographs this is

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.229 
moved between these photographs this is
a<00:03:59.630> 10<00:03:59.959> millimeter<00:04:00.260> lens<00:04:00.709> very<00:04:01.400> wide<00:04:01.670> angle<00:04:02.090> and

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
a 10 millimeter lens very wide angle and

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.080 
a 10 millimeter lens very wide angle and
it<00:04:02.750> sees<00:04:02.930> an<00:04:03.079> awful<00:04:03.590> lot<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.890> garden<00:04:04.250> now

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
it sees an awful lot of the garden now

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.210 
it sees an awful lot of the garden now
let's<00:04:05.299> move<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.900> 20<00:04:06.350> now<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.709> 20<00:04:07.160> as

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
let's move on to the 20 now the 20 as

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.060 
let's move on to the 20 now the 20 as
you<00:04:07.400> see<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.660> little<00:04:09.019> closer<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.560> but<00:04:09.920> it

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
you see is a little closer in but it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.810 
you see is a little closer in but it
still<00:04:10.540> would<00:04:11.540> be<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.810> wide-angle<00:04:12.170> lens<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:13.790> a

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
still would be a wide-angle lens now a

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.330 
still would be a wide-angle lens now a
normal<00:04:14.510> or<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> standard<00:04:15.410> lens<00:04:15.680> would<00:04:16.160> be

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
normal or a standard lens would be

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.909 
normal or a standard lens would be
anywhere<00:04:16.669> between<00:04:16.849> 35<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:17.810> 50<00:04:18.320> millimeter

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
anywhere between 35 and 50 millimeter

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.319 
anywhere between 35 and 50 millimeter
like<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.430> one

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
like this one

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.990 
like this one
and<00:04:20.449> that<00:04:21.169> purely<00:04:21.919> depends<00:04:22.340> on<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.729> type<00:04:22.970> of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and that purely depends on the type of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.180 
and that purely depends on the type of
camera<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.509> have<00:04:23.840> as<00:04:24.319> some<00:04:24.740> cameras<00:04:25.159> have

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
camera you have as some cameras have

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.629 
camera you have as some cameras have
smaller<00:04:25.879> sensors<00:04:26.780> than<00:04:27.080> others<00:04:27.409> a<00:04:27.639> short

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
smaller sensors than others a short

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.170 
smaller sensors than others a short
telephoto<00:04:29.060> lens<00:04:29.539> would<00:04:29.810> be<00:04:30.020> around<00:04:30.770> eighty<00:04:31.460> to

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
telephoto lens would be around eighty to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.689 
telephoto lens would be around eighty to
a<00:04:32.210> hundred<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.810> thirty<00:04:33.020> five-millimeter

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
a hundred and thirty five-millimeter

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.249 
a hundred and thirty five-millimeter
this<00:04:34.699> is<00:04:34.879> a<00:04:34.909> hundred<00:04:35.210> millimeter<00:04:35.599> and<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.110> can

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
this is a hundred millimeter and you can

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.469 
this is a hundred millimeter and you can
see<00:04:36.379> we're<00:04:36.530> getting<00:04:36.770> close<00:04:36.949> up<00:04:37.159> now<00:04:37.400> we're<00:04:38.330> to

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
see we're getting close up now we're to

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.710 
see we're getting close up now we're to
the<00:04:38.509> 200<00:04:39.289> as<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:40.069> can<00:04:40.250> see<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.639> 200<00:04:41.449> is

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
the 200 as you can see that 200 is

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.499 
the 200 as you can see that 200 is
getting<00:04:42.379> a<00:04:42.440> lot<00:04:42.620> closer<00:04:42.849> or<00:04:43.849> bringing<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
getting a lot closer or bringing the

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.230 
getting a lot closer or bringing the
subject<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.259> lot<00:04:45.379> closer<00:04:45.680> now<00:04:46.129> this<00:04:46.699> I<00:04:46.970> would

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
subject a lot closer now this I would

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.350 
subject a lot closer now this I would
call<00:04:47.509> a<00:04:48.199> long<00:04:48.740> no<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.490> call<00:04:49.729> it<00:04:49.819> a<00:04:49.849> medium

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
call a long no I call it a medium

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.420 
call a long no I call it a medium
telephoto<00:04:50.690> they<00:04:51.560> exist<00:04:51.919> up<00:04:52.129> to<00:04:52.250> about<00:04:52.370> a

telephoto they exist up to about a
thousand<00:04:53.060> millimeter<00:04:53.419> know<00:04:54.050> this<00:04:54.229> because

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
thousand millimeter know this because

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.490 
thousand millimeter know this because
they<00:04:54.830> did<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.009> long<00:04:55.389> long<00:04:56.389> telephoto<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.259> three

they did a long long telephoto the three

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.279 
they did a long long telephoto the three
hundred<00:04:57.800> millimeter<00:04:58.599> it's<00:04:59.599> good<00:04:59.840> fun<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.139> see

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
hundred millimeter it's good fun you see

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.159 
hundred millimeter it's good fun you see
how<00:05:00.409> close<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.979> goes<00:05:01.490> up<00:05:01.699> to<00:05:01.879> things<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.479> the

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
how close it goes up to things and the

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.749 
how close it goes up to things and the
by-product<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:04.069> this<00:05:04.280> out<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.580> focus

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
by-product is this out of focus

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.730 
by-product is this out of focus
background<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.539> is<00:05:05.659> much<00:05:05.840> easier<00:05:06.319> to<00:05:06.530> get

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
background that is much easier to get

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.129 
background that is much easier to get
now<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:07.819> called<00:05:08.030> depth<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.479> field<00:05:08.780> and

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
now that's called depth of field and

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.189 
now that's called depth of field and
I've<00:05:09.229> got<00:05:09.409> a<00:05:09.440> lesson<00:05:09.650> on<00:05:09.919> that<00:05:10.069> as<00:05:10.250> well<00:05:11.199> we've

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
I've got a lesson on that as well we've

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:20.740 
I've got a lesson on that as well we've
covered<00:05:17.229> now<00:05:18.229> what's<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.560> prime<00:05:18.919> lens<00:05:19.629> it's<00:05:20.629> a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
covered now what's the prime lens it's a

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.589 
covered now what's the prime lens it's a
lens<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.199> has<00:05:21.259> a<00:05:21.440> fixed<00:05:22.129> focal<00:05:22.729> length<00:05:22.940> so

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
lens that has a fixed focal length so

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.980 
lens that has a fixed focal length so
this<00:05:23.990> is<00:05:24.199> a<00:05:24.229> 24<00:05:24.919> millimeter<00:05:25.130> lens<00:05:25.699> and<00:05:26.449> it<00:05:26.840> will

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
this is a 24 millimeter lens and it will

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.129 
this is a 24 millimeter lens and it will
stay<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.469> 24<00:05:28.400> millimeter<00:05:28.580> lens<00:05:29.210> whatever<00:05:29.750> we<00:05:29.930> do

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
stay a 24 millimeter lens whatever we do

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.339 
stay a 24 millimeter lens whatever we do
it<00:05:30.469> can't<00:05:30.770> be<00:05:30.919> changed<00:05:31.779> the<00:05:32.779> reason<00:05:33.169> for<00:05:33.289> that

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
it can't be changed the reason for that

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.100 
it can't be changed the reason for that
is<00:05:33.949> that<00:05:34.150> normally<00:05:35.150> they're<00:05:35.599> very<00:05:35.870> good

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
is that normally they're very good

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.749 
is that normally they're very good
quality<00:05:36.289> lenses<00:05:38.380> yeah<00:05:39.380> want<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.310> say<00:05:40.580> about

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
quality lenses yeah want to say about

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.209 
quality lenses yeah want to say about
them<00:05:40.969> to<00:05:41.240> keep<00:05:41.389> things<00:05:41.690> simple<00:05:41.840> so<00:05:42.199> a<00:05:42.800> prime

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
them to keep things simple so a prime

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.649 
them to keep things simple so a prime
lens<00:05:43.460> is<00:05:43.699> normally<00:05:44.150> a<00:05:44.180> better<00:05:44.449> lens

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
lens is normally a better lens

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.029 
lens is normally a better lens
now<00:05:47.659> of<00:05:48.110> course<00:05:48.169> there<00:05:48.500> are<00:05:48.590> lots<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.860> other

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
now of course there are lots of other

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.830 
now of course there are lots of other
types<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.550> lenses<00:05:49.789> but<00:05:50.240> as<00:05:50.389> this<00:05:50.599> is<00:05:50.659> a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
types of lenses but as this is a

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.480 
types of lenses but as this is a
beginners<00:05:51.440> lesson<00:05:51.620> I<00:05:51.830> thought<00:05:52.069> it<00:05:52.190> better<00:05:52.340> to

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
beginners lesson I thought it better to

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.450 
beginners lesson I thought it better to
to<00:05:53.090> limit<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.569> that<00:05:53.750> apart<00:05:54.710> from<00:05:54.919> one<00:05:55.129> thing

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
to limit to that apart from one thing

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.420 
to limit to that apart from one thing
and<00:05:55.879> that's<00:05:56.210> cleaning<00:05:56.900> lenses<00:05:57.440> what<00:05:58.099> you

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
and that's cleaning lenses what you

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.640 
and that's cleaning lenses what you
don't<00:05:58.729> do<00:05:59.000> is<00:06:00.009> clean<00:06:01.009> the<00:06:01.129> lens<00:06:01.310> on<00:06:01.460> your<00:06:01.580> shirt

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650
