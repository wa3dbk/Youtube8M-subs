00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.570
 So in class today it's about the origin of the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.150
 life and evolution from evolution 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.800
 always present at the entrance exam is 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.180
 extremely important that you have to 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.619
 to be alert 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.010
 starting with some concessions 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.300
 about the gymnasium from the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.580
 man a man since man has been 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.420
 understand people and start asking 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.550
 to see who I am where I go 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.830
 and begins to question what life is like 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.680
 emerged and spread on our planet 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.900
 First explain it 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.159
 bizarre women believed that a sweaty blouse 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.760
 in the corner of the room 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.720
 could turn to london believed that the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.000
 Dutch could become duck 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.920
 believed that the tablet tree could 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 to give rise to fruits similar to 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.820
 papayas could give milk sheep 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.820
 this was the idea for abl 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.970
 means that life arises from the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 activation of raw material and believe the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.660
 researchers at the time believed in 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.010
 virginia by spontaneous generation is logical 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.570
 that over time 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.210
 several researchers began to 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.100
 question the twin actress passing 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.030
 defended that today we know 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.540
 right 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.630
 to defend the biogene that is the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.600
 gender living things have a life cycle 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.840
 everything served in africa grows and products 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.780
 main memory 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.970
 proves the biogene experiment that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.690
 after several others he managed to 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.790
 once and for all gave algeria was the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.550
 experiment in the experiment of 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.650
 accounts requires that you see there 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.500
 the experiment was done as follows 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.240
 form but earth summons all 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.210
 researchers at the Academy of Sciences of the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.950
 France and does an experiment in the gym 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.130
 of science so that everyone could 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.400
 go along 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.430
 with him in a video balloon he put 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.160
 A nutritious soup was something that could be 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.580
 reform very quickly and then with more 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.190
 relief model the main bottleneck due to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.700
 forming a structure similar to a 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.490
 neck and if this dangerous and difficult 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.760
 truth is the water filter and that even the 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.510
 open channel bacteria fungi no 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.250
 could get in the car 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.190
 had to make cake composition 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.930
 talking bollÃ©e this water filter 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.370
 after doing this but it is faith and that of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.680
 iron that he knew he could have him 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.930
 microorganisms building bacteria that already 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.590
 I was in the car with fungi that 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.860
 on the spot saw the whole apparatus 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.410
 mounted and told friends who want 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.140
 Now you can come here as you please. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.320
 to see this progress proliferate 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.260
 but in this case the amount is 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.150
 day without anything for weeks and nothing and 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.290
 after weeks in protecting the area 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.650
 micro bus 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.500
 the advocates of biogene talk to you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.990
 decreases by about step flow is another 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.470
 already made it pasteur years in the car 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.170
 nothing appears there but the cake 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.620
 cleverly brings together all 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.830
 researchers again that is the bottleneck 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.200
 that it searches for secrecy or is 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.480
 remove the air filter and the next day 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.909
 causing agreement already has 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.310
 passing through the organism with it 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.720
 proves the microorganisms that they in 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.870
 own location 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.629
 microorganisms actually come by 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.090
 reproduction of microorganisms from the air 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.440
 find a conducive environment 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.799
 they will multiply reproduce 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.700
 proving biogenesis, that is to say, 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.430
 bacteria 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.459
 the reproducer, every living thing is capable of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.129
 producing from there it biogenesis 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.940
 makes the theory more accepted in the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.070
 biology and prevention because I see 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.650
 it went well this way when you 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.449
 take a tomato extract that opens it 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.410
 few weeks that rots your 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.060
 refrigerator 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.280
 you go with curd cheese and open the conversation 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.800
 very fast because I wanted to be able to 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.440
 when you open and close and 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.770
 Shooting with you think you want 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.410
 gooseneck provides that food 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.260
 microorganisms that are present there 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.570
 environment will be able to release 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.120
 This is why 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.430
 preservation is called peace. 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.940
 organization in honor of the mother of 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.940
 pastry
