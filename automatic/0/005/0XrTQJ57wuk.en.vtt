00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:09.830
 youtube in this video I will show you how 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:13.429
 convert your avi format movies to 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.740
 dvd format with the money and help 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.680
 time like being able to burn them in the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.920
 good program what we will do is 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.740
 we will need to have already installed once 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.039
 is the saying of this we will proceed to open 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.689
 locates us if I have the number 14 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.960
 we will open the mnr express in any 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.350
 of their versions and do not worry 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 many should try this and it's because 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.190
 what's wrong with you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.510
 to take a movie for money is 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.450
 easy to watch videos and choose the tab that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.830
 says video file we will give you the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.650
 button opens a window in this case 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:00.770
 I will take as an example the folder that 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.770
 has a video content in a soft way 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.180
 and how can you see who tells us that one 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.550
 or several files are due to add to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.760
 a compilation is this that generated this 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.600
 does not support formats that are not formatted 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.120
 dvd since it is the format with which 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.090
 compiles what what videos are or 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.649
 films 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.549
 what we will do will be very simple 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.049
 we will close January express we would know of 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.049
 new in January 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.409
 now we were heading to black video in 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.890
 any of its versions may 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.719
 find in the video or edit video 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.390
 Photo 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.909
 once opened in the video that we see in 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.250
 the tab that there is to export and in dvd and 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.620
 it's called the tab that says the dvd 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.830
 video 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.980
 we wait for them to open us and here as 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.990
 can see there are two buttons that we 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.300
 can serve that is to create and the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.570
 import we will catch what without 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.270
 import, click and click 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 import files here we will choose the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.000
 movie that we want to convert to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.550
 dvd format to burn it 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.900
 here it appears to us the forbidden had a 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.780
 desk open 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.720
 We wait for 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.760
 before now 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.180
 and as you can see here is our 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.180
 movie 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.350
 let's say they are here we will select 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.700
 the dvd that we will use in this 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.740
 case I recommend that you leave it in 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.220
 dvd we also add it in some 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.220
 following 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.360
 here we open a menu to edit it 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.750
 this is optional if you want 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.250
 I for one will leave it as it is 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.900
 was you can take it away if 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.030
 you like here they have several 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.420
 styles or they can see and they will give it and if the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.880
 next button 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.390
 well once done this we give in 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.390
 following 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.390
 and here we give 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.000
 to record 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.520
 we already see in burn in the burner that 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.410
 we have hinders also 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.350
 we can continue on the part button 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.580
 lower right and give it in record in 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.290
 this moment I do not have a disk 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.500
 right 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.970
 I'm already recording what is the video what 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.600
 that you have 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.700
 I'm going to divide without the mistake 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.940
 what happened to them in January express 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.030
 it's a very simple way I think that 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.099
 many did not know of the utility that 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.780
 has the black or if he knew it they did not know 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.150
 where to find it 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.870
 because as you can see a lot of them 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.870
 there was this error 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.170
 terror want to burn a video a dvd are 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.930
 very simple steps 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.300
 I do not know it has been very easy to learn in given 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.720
 case you do not want to record it 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.150
 at this moment only in recording and image 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.000
 and we will be recorded in an image and now 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:37.410
 just how can you see change and we will give you 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.410
 in recording that I'll save it desktop 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.380
 they should save and as you can see the 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.480
 January progress as always this is 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.900
 turning what is our movie 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.020
 in avi format to dvd format 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.350
 What I could see was that black 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:05.639
 he did not admit me several formats that were 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:08.110
 as bbk and bluray extension formats 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.850
 which I decided was telling me that 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.710
 I needed to buy a license that I 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.000
 You can see that it's just going to 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.610
 work for what the files are 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.880
 video or movie download that card 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.610
 as avi files if you notice any 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.979
 problem like this can download a 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.350
 converter convert your movie to 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.289
 clear avi format keeping the 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.120
 specifications of what your video already and 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.960
 once I've converted the video to what 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.260
 you can format avi you can 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.019
 proceed with what is the conversion to 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.339
 dvd format 

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:50.389
 at this time pass the video and with 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:52.910
 she is finished I will return with you 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.910
 how can you see 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.750
 the conversion is over that tells us 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.550
 that the song is over 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.790
 correctly and he asks us if 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.690
 we want to save the record file of 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.590
 tanks and if you taste but me what 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.590
 they keep on the desk 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.910
 at 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.390
 and here is 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:27.210
 and here we will only close it 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.630
 done what is converting our video 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.880
 in dvd format 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.600
 we will simply close what is the 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.600
 net window 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.800
 the question that we will continue with the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.970
 project is to have projects was that 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:49.200
 we started to save the video the 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.200
 illescas was that no 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.450
 well once we have finished 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.260
 the conversion of what was our 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.570
 our movie had vd the only thing 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.090
 What will we do? 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.310
 saved what is the image of the man that 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.260
 has created us in this case they 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.480
 I said save the desktop as you can 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.210
 see here is in film 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.670
 softly shaped film the one 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.670
 we converted earlier I want to walk 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.940
 and here it is what it has become 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.669
 what we will do once you saw and count 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.080
 with a DVD will double click on what 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.210
 what system will be opened to us 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.870
 automatically black express and now 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.480
 with a window to be able 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.900
 we will now record and 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.540
 we will wait for the process to finish 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.880
 well these are very simple steps 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.160
 I hope I have helped you and it has been good 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.330
 all friends thank you very much for the video
