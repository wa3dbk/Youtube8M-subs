blender as a video editor now in the
previous<00:00:08.160> video<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.700> showed<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.179> use

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
previous video I showed you how to use

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.200 
previous video I showed you how to use
your<00:00:09.840> timeline<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.679> quickly<00:00:11.130> navigate<00:00:11.670> around

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
your timeline to quickly navigate around

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.870 
your timeline to quickly navigate around
your<00:00:12.570> video<00:00:12.809> project<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.799> today<00:00:14.549> I'm<00:00:14.790> going

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
your video project and today I'm going

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.420 
your video project and today I'm going
to<00:00:14.940> talk<00:00:15.120> about<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.870> bottom<00:00:16.440> most<00:00:16.710> part<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to talk about the bottom most part of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
to talk about the bottom most part of
the<00:00:17.730> timeline<00:00:18.180> window<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.470> our

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the timeline window which is our

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.330 
the timeline window which is our
playback<00:00:20.699> controls<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.100> go<00:00:23.189> down

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
playback controls now we can go down

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.370 
playback controls now we can go down
here<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.730> take<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> look<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.269> them<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.990> think

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
here and take a look at them and I think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.349 
here and take a look at them and I think
most<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> probably<00:00:26.310> figured<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.000> how

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
most of you probably figured out how

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.080 
most of you probably figured out how
they<00:00:27.840> work<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.380> general<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
they work in general you have the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.759 
they work in general you have the
forward<00:00:30.660> playback<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.529> button

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
forward playback which is this button

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.389 
forward playback which is this button
right<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:33.649> we<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.010> backward

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
right here and we have the backward

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.819 
right here and we have the backward
playback<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.300> button<00:00:36.630> right<00:00:36.660> here

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
playback which is this button right here

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
playback which is this button right here
and<00:00:38.719> then<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.350> two<00:00:41.010> buttons<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and then you have these two buttons that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
and then you have these two buttons that
will<00:00:42.600> take<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> beginning<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.950> our

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
will take you to the beginning of our

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.810 
will take you to the beginning of our
frame<00:00:44.610> range<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:46.140> ending<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.160> our<00:00:47.520> frame

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
frame range and the ending of our frame

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.810 
frame range and the ending of our frame
range<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.570> these<00:00:49.350> little<00:00:49.710> buttons<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.700> are

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
range and these little buttons that are

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630 
range and these little buttons that are
in<00:00:50.969> between<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> would<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.949> are<00:00:53.190> fast

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
in between that you would think are fast

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
in between that you would think are fast
forward<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.239> actually<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:55.350> fast<00:00:55.770> forward

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
forward are actually not fast forward

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.700 
forward are actually not fast forward
buttons<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.090> instead<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.629> used<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.379> our

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
buttons but instead they're used for our

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.700 
buttons but instead they're used for our
key<00:00:58.949> framing<00:00:59.329> which<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.629> something<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
key framing which is something that we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
key framing which is something that we
haven't<00:01:01.859> got<00:01:02.039> around<00:01:02.160> talking<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:02.879> yet<00:01:03.059> but

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
haven't got around talking about yet but

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
haven't got around talking about yet but
we<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.480> talk<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.460> remember

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
we will talk about that so just remember

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.490 
we will talk about that so just remember
that<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.420> before<00:01:06.600> playback<00:01:07.140> backward

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that you have before playback backward

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
that you have before playback backward
playback<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.430> jump<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> forth

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
playback and you can jump back and forth

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
playback and you can jump back and forth
between<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> beginning<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.710> ending<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
between the beginning and the ending of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.719 
between the beginning and the ending of
your<00:01:11.400> frame<00:01:11.970> ranges<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:14.159> things<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.520> need

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
your frame ranges now the things I need

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
your frame ranges now the things I need
to<00:01:14.850> explain<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> guys<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.960> I've<00:01:16.080> noticed

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that many people have had an issue with

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.130 
that many people have had an issue with
is<00:01:19.280> some<00:01:20.280> people<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.790> understand<00:01:21.420> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
is some people don't understand that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.039 
is some people don't understand that
when<00:01:22.439> they're<00:01:22.619> seeing<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.430> frame<00:01:23.880> rate<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
when they're seeing the frame rate up in

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.350 
when they're seeing the frame rate up in
this<00:01:25.229> corner<00:01:25.729> they<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.880> understand<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
this corner they don't understand that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600 
this corner they don't understand that
that<00:01:27.630> doesn't<00:01:27.960> represent<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.890> final<00:01:29.400> frame

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that doesn't represent the final frame

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
that doesn't represent the final frame
rate<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> final

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
rate that they will get in the final

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
rate that they will get in the final
rendered<00:01:32.189> video<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:33.299> let<00:01:33.479> me<00:01:33.570> actually

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
rendered video now let me actually

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
rendered video now let me actually
demonstrate<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.770> by<00:01:35.040> hitting<00:01:35.250> the

demonstrate that to you by hitting the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160 
demonstrate that to you by hitting the
play<00:01:35.579> button<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.900> we're<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
play button down here and we're going to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
play button down here and we're going to
look<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.970> our

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
look up here and we can see that our

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.260 
look up here and we can see that our
frame<00:01:39.450> rate<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.960> fluctuating<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.119> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
frame rate is fluctuating now you can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
frame rate is fluctuating now you can
see<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.020> video<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> actually<00:01:43.799> supposed

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
see that this video is actually supposed

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
see that this video is actually supposed
to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> 24<00:01:44.850> frames<00:01:45.119> per<00:01:45.210> second<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.899> look<00:01:46.110> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
to be 24 frames per second but look it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.940 
to be 24 frames per second but look it's
going<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.880> 20<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.049> oat

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
going down to 20 it's going up to oat

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.270 
going down to 20 it's going up to oat
going<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.759> over<00:01:50.909> 24<00:01:51.540> frames<00:01:51.780> per<00:01:51.840> second

but<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.110> we're<00:02:16.230> watching<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.100> real

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
but when we're watching this in real

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.760 
but when we're watching this in real
time<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.060> preview<00:02:18.420> window<00:02:18.570> it's<00:02:19.410> just

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
time in the preview window it's just

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.830 
time in the preview window it's just
trying<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.250> give<00:02:20.460> us<00:02:20.700> an<00:02:20.910> example<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.540> how<00:02:21.660> it's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
trying to give us an example of how it's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
trying to give us an example of how it's
going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.050> look<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.350> fast<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> possibly<00:02:23.310> can

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
going to look as fast as it possibly can

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.640 
going to look as fast as it possibly can
but<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.240> obviously<00:02:24.720> does<00:02:25.020> not<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
but it obviously does not have the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.930 
but it obviously does not have the
capability<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:26.310> render<00:02:26.580> everything

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
capability to render everything

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.630 
capability to render everything
perfectly<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.050> what<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.350> doing<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:29.070> it's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
perfectly so what it's doing is it's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.620 
perfectly so what it's doing is it's
dropping<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.360> frames<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.710> preview<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
dropping the frames of the preview and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.260 
dropping the frames of the preview and
making<00:02:33.630> sure<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.950> stay<00:02:35.270> synchronized

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
making sure that we stay synchronized

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.870 
making sure that we stay synchronized
with<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> audio<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.610> our

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
with the audio so that we can do our

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.660 
with the audio so that we can do our
edits<00:02:39.450> without<00:02:40.050> any<00:02:40.440> issues<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.520> don't

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
edits without any issues so we don't

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.610 
edits without any issues so we don't
really<00:02:41.730> need<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.330> able<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.380> full

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
really need to be able to see the full

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800 
really need to be able to see the full

how<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.710> edit<00:02:46.890> things<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.150> all<00:02:48.630> I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
how to edit things so that's all I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.150 
how to edit things so that's all I
really<00:02:49.080> want<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.410> tell<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> guys<00:02:49.710> about<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
really want to tell you guys about the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.590 
really want to tell you guys about the
frame<00:02:50.460> rate<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.940> preview<00:02:51.240> window<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.570> just

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
frame rate in the preview window is just

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.890 
frame rate in the preview window is just
don't<00:02:51.990> let<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.610> confuse<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.390> has

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
don't let that confuse you it has

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
don't let that confuse you it has
nothing<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.290> do<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.920> final<00:02:56.250> frame<00:02:56.430> rate

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
nothing to do with the final frame rate

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.920 
nothing to do with the final frame rate
the<00:02:56.760> final<00:02:57.120> frame<00:02:57.270> rate<00:02:57.480> when<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.720> hit<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the final frame rate when you hit the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.250 
the final frame rate when you hit the
animation<00:02:58.560> button<00:02:58.800> will<00:02:59.490> be<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> static<00:03:00.260> 24

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
animation button will be a static 24

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.690 
animation button will be a static 24
frames<00:03:01.470> per<00:03:01.590> second<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.220> case<00:03:02.460> or

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
frames per second in this case or

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.520 
frames per second in this case or
whatever<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:03.990> frame<00:03:04.320> rate

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
whatever you have in this frame rate

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.490 
whatever you have in this frame rate
drop<00:03:04.860> down<00:03:05.070> box<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> think<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.050> clarifies

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
drop down box so I think that clarifies

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.340 
drop down box so I think that clarifies
that<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:09.480> other<00:03:09.690> thing<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.020> want<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.200> show

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
that the other thing that I want to show

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.400 
that the other thing that I want to show
you<00:03:10.410> guys<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:11.040> there<00:03:11.550> are<00:03:11.640> two<00:03:11.910> ways<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.630> when

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
you guys is there are two ways that when

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.010 
you guys is there are two ways that when
you're<00:03:13.560> playing<00:03:13.890> your<00:03:14.130> preview<00:03:14.460> back<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.840> can

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
you're playing your preview back you can

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.260 
you're playing your preview back you can
improve<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.220> frame<00:03:17.610> rate<00:03:17.790> or<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.060> cause

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
improve the frame rate or you can cause

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.100 
improve the frame rate or you can cause
it<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.480> jump<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.490> notice<00:03:21.110> you

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
it to jump up and you can notice you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.260 
it to jump up and you can notice you
might<00:03:22.230> have<00:03:22.320> noticed<00:03:22.560> right<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.270> my

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
might have noticed right now that my

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.300 
might have noticed right now that my
frame<00:03:24.510> rate<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.900> actually<00:03:25.110> really<00:03:25.740> low<00:03:25.950> it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
frame rate is actually really low it's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.380 
frame rate is actually really low it's
been<00:03:26.490> playing<00:03:26.730> for<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.940> while<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.330> the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
been playing for a while and the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.790 
been playing for a while and the
computer<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:27.750> falling<00:03:28.080> behind<00:03:28.230> in

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
computer is really falling behind in

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.760 
computer is really falling behind in
trying<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.310> keep<00:03:29.520> up<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.870> create<00:03:31.650> these

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
trying to keep up and and create these

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.160 
trying to keep up and and create these
each<00:03:32.250> frame<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.540> dropping<00:03:33.750> down<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.020> a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
each frame so it's dropping down to a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.840 
each frame so it's dropping down to a
very<00:03:34.290> low<00:03:34.410> number<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:34.950> we<00:03:35.010> can<00:03:35.130> still<00:03:35.580> stay

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
very low number so we can still stay

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.460 
very low number so we can still stay
synchronized<00:03:36.209> with<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.630> audio<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.350> there's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
synchronized with the audio but there's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.690 
synchronized with the audio but there's
two<00:03:37.590> things<00:03:37.770> we<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:37.920> do<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.520> both

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
two things we can do and they both

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.020 
two things we can do and they both

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
have a refresh sequencer button and let

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.380 
have a refresh sequencer button and let
me<00:03:45.239> pause<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.660> video<00:03:45.870> quickly<00:03:47.090> whenever<00:03:48.090> I

I've<00:04:45.060> noticed<00:04:45.240> with<00:04:45.510> some<00:04:45.690> videos<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.170> seems

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
I've noticed with some videos it seems

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.490 
I've noticed with some videos it seems
to<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.530> set<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.830> 25<00:04:47.430> but<00:04:48.330> for<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:49.020> one<00:04:49.170> is<00:04:49.320> set

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
to be set to 25 but for this one is set

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.340 
to be set to 25 but for this one is set
to<00:04:49.620> 0<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.760> turn<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.150> all<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.390> way<00:04:51.570> up<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:52.140> the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
to 0 but I turn it all the way up to the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.700 
to 0 but I turn it all the way up to the
max<00:04:52.560> which<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:52.860> 50<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.870> appears<00:04:55.620> that

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
max which is 50 and it appears that

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.160 
max which is 50 and it appears that
whenever<00:04:56.040> you<00:04:56.430> do<00:04:56.640> this<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.180> then<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:57.510> go<00:04:57.870> and

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
whenever you do this and then you go and

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.310 
whenever you do this and then you go and
click<00:04:58.500> refresh<00:04:58.770> sequencer<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.810> improves

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
click refresh sequencer that it improves

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.170 
click refresh sequencer that it improves
the<00:05:01.770> quality<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.820> playback

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
the quality of the playback

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.110 
the quality of the playback
significantly<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.500> turn<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.580> 50<00:05:05.910> and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
significantly so I turn this to 50 and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.030 
significantly so I turn this to 50 and
then<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> hit<00:05:06.450> refresh<00:05:06.600> sequencer<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.380> then<00:05:08.010> I

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
then I hit refresh sequencer and then I

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.110 
then I hit refresh sequencer and then I
hit<00:05:08.220> play<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:09.800> it's<00:05:10.800> staying<00:05:11.160> towards<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.610> 24

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
hit play and it's staying towards the 24

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.060 
hit play and it's staying towards the 24
much<00:05:12.600> more<00:05:13.020> than<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.710> was<00:05:13.830> it's<00:05:14.040> not

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
much more than it was it's not

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.270 
much more than it was it's not
fluctuating<00:05:14.700> as<00:05:15.360> much<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.380> that's<00:05:16.560> that's<00:05:16.980> the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
fluctuating as much so that's that's the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.890 
fluctuating as much so that's that's the
other<00:05:17.460> way<00:05:17.669> that<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:17.910> can<00:05:18.000> actually<00:05:18.510> greatly

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
other way that you can actually greatly

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.790 
other way that you can actually greatly
improve<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.650> preview<00:05:20.250> playback<00:05:20.750> now<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:22.110> think

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
improve the preview playback now I think

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.550 
improve the preview playback now I think
that<00:05:23.400> pretty<00:05:23.640> much<00:05:23.790> clarifies<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:25.290> most

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
that pretty much clarifies the most

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.230 
that pretty much clarifies the most
important<00:05:25.980> things<00:05:26.100> about<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.460> playback<00:05:26.880> and

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
important things about the playback and

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.580 
important things about the playback and
I'll<00:05:27.960> see<00:05:28.260> you<00:05:28.380> guys<00:05:28.530> in<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.130> next<00:05:29.280> video
