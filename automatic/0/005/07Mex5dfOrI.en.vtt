the standard first move the first move I
would<00:00:27.449> most<00:00:27.630> likely<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.769> la

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

Hanzo i hanzo gets the gets the super

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.979 
Hanzo i hanzo gets the gets the super
transformation<00:03:07.820> which<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.300> godlike<00:03:08.690> card

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
transformation which is the godlike card

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.530 
transformation which is the godlike card
and<00:03:09.260> i'm<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.519> use<00:03:10.700> hansa<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.239> attack

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and i'm going to use hansa to attack

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.590 
and i'm going to use hansa to attack
into<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.350> window<00:03:12.830> which<00:03:13.130> he<00:03:13.340> got<00:03:13.940> from<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
into the window which he got from the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.560 
into the window which he got from the
pot<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.560> duality<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.070> winde<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.090> basically

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
pot of duality and winde is basically

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.330 
pot of duality and winde is basically
going<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.810> summon<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.230> monster<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.829> i<00:03:18.890> will

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
going to summon the monster that i will

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.830 
going to summon the monster that i will
transform<00:03:20.000> with<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.500> i<00:03:21.730> should<00:03:22.730> be

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
transform with and i should be

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.350 
transform with and i should be
transforming<00:03:23.840> into<00:03:24.730> should<00:03:25.730> be<00:03:25.820> transforming

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
transforming into should be transforming

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.479 
transforming into should be transforming
into<00:03:26.450> oh<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.230> unfortunately<00:03:27.680> he<00:03:27.829> summon<00:03:28.100> eagle

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
into oh so unfortunately he summon eagle

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.250 
into oh so unfortunately he summon eagle
so<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.090> best<00:03:29.239> thing<00:03:29.360> I'll<00:03:29.570> transform<00:03:30.019> into

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
so the best thing I'll transform into

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.100 
so the best thing I'll transform into
his<00:03:30.530> basically<00:03:31.100> debris<00:03:31.430> dragon<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.900> is

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
his basically debris dragon that is

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.229 
his basically debris dragon that is
until<00:03:33.890> my<00:03:34.010> opponent<00:03:34.400> made<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.640> fatal<00:03:34.880> mistake

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
until my opponent made the fatal mistake

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.780 
until my opponent made the fatal mistake
of<00:03:35.390> using<00:03:35.510> creature<00:03:35.870> swap<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.500> I'm<00:03:37.070> like<00:03:37.100> okay

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
of using creature swap and I'm like okay

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.319 
of using creature swap and I'm like okay
cool<00:03:38.150> I'll<00:03:38.390> just<00:03:38.750> chain<00:03:39.049> two<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.860> then<00:03:40.820> use

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
cool I'll just chain two and then use

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.180 
cool I'll just chain two and then use
the<00:03:41.540> super<00:03:41.750> transformation<00:03:42.380> get<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.890> debris

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
the super transformation get the debris

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.920 
the super transformation get the debris
dragon<00:03:43.579> in<00:03:43.670> attack<00:03:43.730> mode<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.450> you're<00:03:44.900> just

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
dragon in attack mode and you're just

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
honest to my hand which is really really

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.909 
honest to my hand which is really really
broken<00:04:44.599> but<00:04:45.379> unfortunately<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:46.669> should<00:04:47.539> I

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
broken but unfortunately I should I

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.290 
broken but unfortunately I should I
decided<00:04:48.919> to<00:04:49.099> just<00:04:49.280> overcome<00:04:49.729> it<00:04:49.849> to<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.060> board

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
decided to just overcome it to the board

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.379 
decided to just overcome it to the board
the<00:04:51.289> reason<00:04:51.590> being<00:04:51.940> basically<00:04:52.940> if<00:04:53.270> my

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
the reason being basically if my

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.899 
the reason being basically if my
opponent<00:04:53.630> top<00:04:54.289> stacks<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.770> dark<00:04:55.009> hole<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.550> he

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
opponent top stacks a dark hole and he

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.760 
opponent top stacks a dark hole and he
has<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> monster<00:04:56.389> in<00:04:56.569> his<00:04:56.810> hand<00:04:57.050> I'll<00:04:57.470> lose

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
has a monster in his hand I'll lose

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.379 
has a monster in his hand I'll lose
anyway<00:04:58.099> because<00:04:58.340> my<00:04:58.580> life<00:04:58.729> point<00:04:59.000> is<00:04:59.060> too<00:04:59.210> low

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
anyway because my life point is too low

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.749 
anyway because my life point is too low
so<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.259> might<00:05:00.500> as<00:05:00.560> well<00:05:00.710> just<00:05:00.979> do<00:05:01.159> the<00:05:01.280> maximum

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
so I might as well just do the maximum

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.029 
so I might as well just do the maximum
damage<00:05:01.970> i<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.840> then<00:05:02.870> prepare<00:05:03.770> for<00:05:03.949> the

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
damage i can and then prepare for the

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.680 
damage i can and then prepare for the
worst<00:05:04.250> with<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.759> super<00:05:05.000> transformation

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
worst with the super transformation

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.439 
worst with the super transformation
right<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:07.039> my<00:05:07.159> opponent's<00:05:07.639> turn<00:05:07.819> my

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
right and it's my opponent's turn my

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.270 
right and it's my opponent's turn my
opponent<00:05:08.900> didn't<00:05:09.289> have<00:05:09.470> dark<00:05:09.680> hole<00:05:09.860> but<00:05:10.069> he

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
opponent didn't have dark hole but he

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.430 
opponent didn't have dark hole but he
had<00:05:10.520> mind<00:05:10.970> control<00:05:11.419> and<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.780> was<00:05:11.930> really<00:05:12.139> sad

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
had mind control and I was really sad

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.520 
had mind control and I was really sad
because<00:05:12.650> he<00:05:13.009> totally<00:05:13.639> could<00:05:13.759> have<00:05:13.819> gotten<00:05:14.120> my

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
because he totally could have gotten my

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.909 
because he totally could have gotten my
BLS<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:15.800> just<00:05:16.190> removed<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:16.849> BLS<00:05:17.270> using<00:05:18.139> pls

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
BLS and just removed the BLS using pls

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.010 
BLS and just removed the BLS using pls

effect to remove the m7 or something
like<00:05:21.139> that<00:05:21.199> but<00:05:22.099> he<00:05:22.280> did<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.699> use<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.539> get

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
like that but he did you use it to get

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.719 
like that but he did you use it to get
back<00:05:24.139> his<00:05:25.000> junk<00:05:26.000> Synchron<00:05:26.330> using<00:05:26.659> my<00:05:26.780> m7<00:05:27.289> and

I'm basically going to let this go until

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.159 
I'm basically going to let this go until
he<00:05:31.610> synchro<00:05:31.909> summons<00:05:32.270> into<00:05:32.569> something<00:05:32.900> that<00:05:33.139> I

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
he synchro summons into something that I

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.100
