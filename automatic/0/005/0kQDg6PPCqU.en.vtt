00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.350
 First of all b 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:30.980
 lightly coat the white of pb 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.740
 Where I'm painting thinly now 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 To here 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.360
 Put in light and cure 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.809
 After curing for 20 seconds 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.660
 You're welcome 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.870
 After curing this is now curing under this elevated 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.329
 above 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 I will repeat the other color pb No. 6 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.070
 Put the pink of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.130
 I took it with a brush 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.940
 Place a little flows through such a line so that the diagonal 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.290
 Rather than being 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.290
 I will open it with a feeling like hitting it lightly 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.840
 Then pb 8 No. of ho range 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.600
 Ne 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.270
 This color 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.270
 I will go where I left the gap with 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.270
 The series of pb is fine 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.409
 I wonder if it contains pearls that shine brightly 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.720
 Because it is pearl color 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.260
 Well familiar with color and color 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.540
 The gradation can be very beautiful 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.710
 next 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.510
 It is green of the 11th char of pb 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.510
 I will put this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 It may be a bit difficult to see because it is a pale pastel color 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 Pink and orange and green are located in the top of the now 3 fair 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.970
 I will add one more color 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.970
 I No. 12 of eb 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.520
 Even if it's fine if you want it 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.140
 As it becomes gradation, it is all right to have you in random 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.210
 In particular 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:03.300
 As it spreads only by putting even if you are not aware of the gradation 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.300
 It will come training color is familiar 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.190
 Hey orange and the last 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 Between the color of the 12th green 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.849
 pb rock pink a little more 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.849
 can enter 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.710
 Make a note and white 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:50.410
 If you can not see it, you may enter the castle after this 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.410
 where the white of pb is open 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.090
 With or without 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.090
 Please finish with it if the balance is good 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.819
 The color went like this 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.819
 And put in and cure for 20 seconds 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.520
 The effect is 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.000
 When it is over 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:24.650
 Make sure the surface is firmly cured 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.650
 I will repeat the color again where I feel that the color is light 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:37.440
 A not to put a lot of amount at a time if you want to black 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:40.310
 Please cure on top of the thin and overpainted ones, and make another color. 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.620
 If you apply a lot at one time 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.620
 Because it causes curing failure 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.740
 When you want to darken the color 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.740
 Repeat times while curing 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.360
 If you want to make it look fluffy , even if it is applied once, the color appears completely at all 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.990
 I think it's good 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.990
 If you want to make it clearer and darker, apply twice. 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160
 I painted it twice so I will put it in the light again 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.150
 It also cures for 20 seconds 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.950
 If the effect is over, here is true 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.169
 I will be under pressure 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.120
 all 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.729
 I will put things in the form of stars 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.889
 Overall 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.889
 Apply clear gel lightly 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.210
 there 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.139
 Shell 's 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.490
 I will keep 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.490
 It is Toba want 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.470
 Such as pearl here 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.470
 I think 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.689
 r is 8 Stutz what size is also a variety of 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.919
 I put together 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.770
 If you put stones and parts like this one more time 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:32.350
 Put in light and cure 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.350
 Please cure well for 20 seconds 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.150
 If the effect is over 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:43.620
 Clear gel 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.620
 And then applied to the entire the most clear gel will fill the entire Sea 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:07:00.150
 There is a sense of asperity in the one that contains gold such as ramen from the color and pearl containing glitter 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:05.580
 Because it may remain, it is also to make the surface smooth 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:07.420
 Apply the most clear gel of c once before painting the top of the finish teach 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.080
 I finish beautifully 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:17.030
 Put in the light again and cure 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:19.930
 When the effect is over , apply t top gel on top 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.930
 I will go to the finish 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:34.900
 Because the top gel of p is a smooth type 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.900
 Please be careful because it is easy to escape and become for many brush 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.500
 Please see and add elements while painting 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.569
 I 'll paint it all over, so I'll put it in the light again 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:49.470
 The last is 

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:52.220
 Please put in for 30 seconds and make poison firmly 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.460
 When the last school song is over 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.180
 FLET 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:08:00.240
 Let me be a child 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.240
 Wipe off Wipe uncured gel firmly 

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.480
 It is completed by
