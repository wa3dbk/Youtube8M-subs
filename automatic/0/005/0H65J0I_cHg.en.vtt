00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
then I was scheduled to do it and that

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.120 
then I was scheduled to do it and that
would<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.730> been<00:02:36.880> an<00:02:37.000> absolute<00:02:37.510> blast<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.830> I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
would have been an absolute blast so I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.220 
would have been an absolute blast so I
didn't<00:02:39.580> turn<00:02:39.760> down<00:02:40.030> tough<00:02:40.420> enough<00:02:40.660> because<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
didn't turn down tough enough because I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.680 
didn't turn down tough enough because I
have<00:02:41.560> heat<00:02:41.830> with<00:02:41.980> Vincent<00:02:42.400> man<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:43.420> was<00:02:43.569> my

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
have heat with Vincent man that was my

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.770 
have heat with Vincent man that was my
first<00:02:44.019> reality<00:02:44.489> television<00:02:45.489> hosting<00:02:46.299> gig<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
first reality television hosting gig and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.990 
first reality television hosting gig and
I<00:02:46.900> absolutely<00:02:47.170> loved<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.640> helped<00:02:48.910> get

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
I absolutely loved it and it helped get

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.309 
I absolutely loved it and it helped get
the<00:02:49.150> other<00:02:49.299> gigs<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.110> now<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:51.220> as<00:02:51.489> well<00:02:51.760> so

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
the other gigs that I now do as well so

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.660 
the other gigs that I now do as well so
scheduling<00:02:53.319> problems<00:02:53.769> prevented<00:02:54.250> me<00:02:54.640> from

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
scheduling problems prevented me from

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.270 
scheduling problems prevented me from
doing<00:02:54.940> tough<00:02:55.480> enough<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.049> didn't<00:02:56.799> turn<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.130> down

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
doing tough enough I didn't turn it down

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.690 
doing tough enough I didn't turn it down
for<00:02:57.849> any<00:02:58.120> other<00:02:58.330> reason<00:02:58.720> than<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.739> wish<00:03:00.610> I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
for any other reason than that wish I

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.370 
for any other reason than that wish I
could<00:03:00.849> have<00:03:00.940> done<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.209> too<00:03:01.780> bad<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.049> couldn't

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380
