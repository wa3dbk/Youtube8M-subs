pickpocketed Orpik locked one of the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.040 
pickpocketed Orpik locked one of the
chests<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.850> 650<00:00:23.850> thieving<00:00:24.480> experience

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and that I to chests better world now

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.660 
and that I to chests better world now
the<00:00:27.990> reason<00:00:28.349> why<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.529> wasn't<00:00:29.070> popular<00:00:29.220> back

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the reason why this wasn't popular back

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.580 
the reason why this wasn't popular back
then<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.199> released

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
then because this was released

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.790 
then because this was released
originally<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.669> 2007<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.649> had

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
originally in 2007 was because you had

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.970 
originally in 2007 was because you had
to<00:00:34.980> wait<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.540> 40<00:00:37.020> seconds<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to wait what was it 40 seconds when you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
to wait what was it 40 seconds when you
switch<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> world<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.629> don't<00:00:39.960> have

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
switch the world and now we don't have

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260 
switch the world and now we don't have
to<00:00:40.410> wait<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.460> keep<00:00:41.700> logging<00:00:42.120> in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to wait so we can just keep logging in

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.470 
to wait so we can just keep logging in
and<00:00:42.360> logging<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.820> picklock<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.090> chest

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and logging out and picklock this chest

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.979 
and logging out and picklock this chest
for<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:46.520> 200,000<00:00:47.520> experience<00:00:48.030> an<00:00:48.210> hour<00:00:48.360> now

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
for over 200,000 experience an hour now

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
for over 200,000 experience an hour now
I'm<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.230> sure<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.710> faster<00:00:50.340> than

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
I'm not sure if this is faster than

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
I'm not sure if this is faster than
pyramid<00:00:50.969> blended<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.899> don't<00:00:52.500> remember

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pyramid blended because I don't remember

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.549 
pyramid blended because I don't remember
the<00:00:53.219> rates<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.640> level<00:00:53.969> 91<00:00:54.300> plus<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> do

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the rates for level 91 plus but I do

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.490 
the rates for level 91 plus but I do
know<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.190> level<00:00:56.430> 8<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> 1<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.570> 160

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
know from level 8 to 1 you get like 160

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.900 
know from level 8 to 1 you get like 160
or<00:00:58.739> 180<00:00:59.190> thousand<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.840> close<00:01:01.230> or

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
or 180 thousand so it's very close or

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.939 
or 180 thousand so it's very close or
you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.059> even<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.690> same<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.229> pyramid

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
you know even the same as pyramid

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.789 
you know even the same as pyramid
plundered<00:01:05.430> however<00:01:06.030> only<00:01:06.450> four<00:01:07.049> people<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
plundered however only four people can

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.280 
plundered however only four people can
do<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.189> no<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.670> than<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.630> there

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
do this no more than that because there

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
do this no more than that because there
are<00:01:10.320> limited<00:01:10.740> amounts<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.220> worlds<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.150> let's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
are limited amounts of worlds so let's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
are limited amounts of worlds so let's
say<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.720> 10<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.320> pick<00:01:13.560> locking<00:01:13.979> these

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
say that I 10 people pick locking these

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.460 
say that I 10 people pick locking these
chests<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> quick<00:01:15.450> hop<00:01:15.689> worlds<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
chests and if you quick hop worlds you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
chests and if you quick hop worlds you
will<00:01:16.650> eventually<00:01:17.189> find<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> chest<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.360> was

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
will eventually find the chest which was

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.820 
will eventually find the chest which was
already<00:01:18.930> looted<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:21.090> obviously

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
already looted so that will obviously

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
already looted so that will obviously
reduce<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> XP<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.880> every<00:01:24.390> single

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
reduce the XP that you get every single

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
reduce the XP that you get every single
hour<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:25.740> Bank<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.640> don't

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
hour and don't Bank if you do this don't

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330 
hour and don't Bank if you do this don't
Bank<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.770> loot<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
Bank just don't because the loot as you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
Bank just don't because the loot as you
can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.790> bad<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> reasons<00:01:31.470> why

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
can see is bad one of the reasons why

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
can see is bad one of the reasons why
I've<00:01:31.770> done<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> wanted<00:01:33.090> some

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I can get a lot of those because

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.060 
I can get a lot of those because

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
this is all all of it it seems that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.649 
this is all all of it it seems that
every<00:02:28.829> single<00:02:29.159> item<00:02:29.340> has<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.700> same<00:02:30.090> droplet

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.380 
have a lower one but I think I just got
unlucky<00:02:37.739> on<00:02:37.950> these<00:02:38.129> ones<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.209> see

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
unlucky on these ones so you can see

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.449 
unlucky on these ones so you can see
you're<00:02:39.840> not<00:02:40.049> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.409> sell<00:02:40.650> frog<00:02:41.190> leather

price but I don't think these are going
to<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.780> worth<00:02:55.049> anything

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
to be worth anything

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.210
