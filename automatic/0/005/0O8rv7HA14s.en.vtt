 I see a piece here as we see 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.619
 So here is a full-fledged wrist 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.109
 and that is exactly what we want now 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 take a closer look and unpack that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.469
 because we already have it with us 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.489

 Wrist watch from the package you can see so 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:53.840

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.899
 here 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 So have a look at some more details 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.310

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.750
