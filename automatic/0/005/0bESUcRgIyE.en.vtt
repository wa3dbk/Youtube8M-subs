00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone with you cuirassier and after 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 I recommend watching my video 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.649
 subscribe to one great channel on 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.690
 which you will find many interesting 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.059
 clips and if you like them 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 be sure to like and subscribe 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.250
 but I will leave the link in the description and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.410
 annotations on the screen and now we 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.510
 hello to everyone with you cuirassier and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 we keep playing the hunger games on 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 lobby games 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 for some reason on the map games lobby as well 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.469
 as on the sollar map, growth is almost always 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.440
 games go very fast bay this 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.440
 it was tough 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 by the way if someone does not know now from 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.530
 the framework can not get anything so 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.510
 You can write in the comments what 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.410
 there is a diamond sword 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.620
 then I repeatedly lught apparently those who 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.980
 This wrote not watched my series until 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.370
 of this this sword and repeatedly lutal and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.059
 there is a button there 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.330
 which framed is diamond but with 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.610
 more recently, no more 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.539
 on the hunger games things out of the framework therefore 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.159
 here so here actually 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.259
 so you can not write it can 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.850
 writing principle okay what not to write 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:26.500
 again so that we have some sort of armor 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.469
 there is so this guy is looking for things here but 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.850
 there are no arrows on it probably 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:37.600
 I will not spend everything for hire 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.789
 normal did not have to go look 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.739
 bib still I need to eat 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.810
 so now here crawl through somehow or 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:49.720
 for the top but this series will be real 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.229
 probably very fast as always 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.890
 Anna 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.860
 you map is happening so it should still 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.689
 something not zahavat so but at the beginning 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.770
 let's see what we have here a bib 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:09.970
 good bib just decomposed yet 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.709
 here these things are boots now 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:20.079
 eat in boots still such 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:23.139
 is someone coming here in my or not? 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:29.010
 i'm going downstairs chattering another chest 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:31.670
 from this side I'll probably go further 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.640
 so this world needs 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.780
 before of course i put that perry can 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.130
 useful for crafting like but I'll go myself 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 now probably already all wet 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:53.360
 also ingots no okay would have been with 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:57.230
 fireplaces than running so where are you talking 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.680
 just sometimes the shock of what i can't 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.310
 get in front of me is a guy i'm very 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.870
 ca n't get me of course 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.670
 repeatedly 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.209
 many said to put the name 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.630
 fov in my field of view yes more there 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.430
 Sotochku or on anything I even 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.290
 honestly say played with such a vision 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.410
 somewhere probably five days clean without 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.970
 records just trained but I realized that 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.519
 eyes get very tired and fast 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.140
 what vision 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.120
 how would we get greased on the sides 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.820
 picture and not very nice somehow 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.100
 watch me personally at least me 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.519
 said that you will get used you will get used but I 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.930
 so not used so I do not 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.549
 in general it seems like well actually 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.190
 my experience I can say that so 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.930
 really got to play a little better 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:04.400
 but still I donâ€™t want to spoil my eyesight 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:09.370
 so I will not play like that 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:15.720
 there little dog let's better let me be 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:18.329
 somehow here so someone climbs let's 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.919
 kill him 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:30.340
 at the beginning so Nuka-Nuka-Nuka Bay 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:34.210
 urgent need down urgent where 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:42.880

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:51.370

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.730
 ran out 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:14.060
 excellent clear pair tactics 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:22.190
