00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello everyone hello dear viewers 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.090
 you Arseniy hsien tripod remember 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 smog which showed us fribberg 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.389
 dust2 map 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.340
 don't mind tsm so here you were not freeberg 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.590
 showed us to turn out to be case 100 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.619
 freeberg just played a smog chip 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.019
 I could just supersky and I remembered 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.710
 literally woke up at night decided to record 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.050
 for you mini guide well and look see 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.020
 and use a really cool chip 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.739
 on dusti very rarely when something 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.960
 someone will come up with something new and so 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.390
 we could smog aim just in the middle 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 raise the scope up but at the same time 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 look at thumb thumb 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 there must be about 3 centimeters from 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.730
 this black strip here and 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 accordingly, I took myself further 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.250
 see for the landmark the drenched be started warm 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 up his and its this underline 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.640
 and accordingly this is an underscore 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.810
 should the left overlap this here 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.310
 Chernen'kii flyspecked here ended with white 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.360
 letters written. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.290
 and further black . texture on yellow 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.200
 well and respectively 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.950
 clamp smog throw and fly 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.610
 flew flew there is contact excellent 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.470
 Well, the same thing friends yes well, here it is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.450
 this smog can be calculated very well with us 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.729
 In the first picture there is very bad 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.920
 and the sniper of course the sniper can of course 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.509
 see but the trick is that I could when 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.750
 starts to disperse by a little bit 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.399
 that's literally starting right now 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.720
 cool shine through the gap 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.229
 flour tulip and so on even if you 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.579
 friends right hand 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.640
 all the same fit resist 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.930
 aim at the center lower down and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.970
 accordingly, this is the left black 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.970
 compare strip 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.230
 and throw you by the way this smog happens 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.790
 also 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.490
 and their attacks on the account thought it was 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.130
 generally able to perfect just yet 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.450
 for example clamping length 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.400
 also falls almost to the patient here 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.380
 there is really a small gap and in principle 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.270
 from here the player can kill for example 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.730
 if you fall under such but in 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.240
 principle for passage for example including but 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.260
 it could for cool i'm not a little bit 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.360
 threw threw here you understand 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:53.490
 jewelry work well here again like this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:56.550
 as something like that and lay down and here he is 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.640
 This could friends from here then power and 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.010
 neatly and start to calculate here 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.870
 so if you can watch the video 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.060
 this is not visible because of the quality though 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.830
 quality should be good but in general 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.350
 dear friends can be seen 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.300
 not bad enough opponents 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.860
 who will fight against you hope 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.700
 could you like it bye bye 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.620
 fingers up do not forget
