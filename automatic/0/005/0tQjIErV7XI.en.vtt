to see comeback is the at least

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.680 
to see comeback is the at least
manageable<00:02:52.280> version<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.760> scavenger<00:02:53.300> this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
manageable version of scavenger this

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.510 
manageable version of scavenger this
scavenger<00:02:53.960> only<00:02:54.410> picks<00:02:54.620> up<00:02:54.770> bullets<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.370> don't

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
scavenger only picks up bullets I don't

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.000 
scavenger only picks up bullets I don't
know<00:02:55.580> what<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.910> fuck<00:02:56.440> that's<00:02:57.440> not<00:02:57.770> that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
know what the fuck that's not that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.920 
know what the fuck that's not that
should<00:02:58.220> be<00:02:58.370> common<00:02:58.730> sense<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:59.360> first<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.840> all

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
should be common sense that first of all

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.200 
should be common sense that first of all
if<00:03:00.020> somebody<00:03:00.350> sees<00:03:01.250> boats<00:03:01.550> on<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.760> ground<00:03:02.030> for

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
if somebody sees boats on the ground for

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.430 
if somebody sees boats on the ground for
their<00:03:02.300> gun<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.600> they<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.810> almost<00:03:02.960> no<00:03:03.140> ammo

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
their gun that they have almost no ammo

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.540 
their gun that they have almost no ammo
that<00:03:03.590> should<00:03:03.740> be<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.860> common-sense<00:03:04.160> thing<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.520> I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
that should be a common-sense thing so I

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.610 
that should be a common-sense thing so I
don't<00:03:04.610> think<00:03:04.850> reap<00:03:05.390> picking<00:03:06.050> up<00:03:06.170> bullets<00:03:06.470> for

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
don't think reap picking up bullets for

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.500 
don't think reap picking up bullets for
your<00:03:06.710> gun<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:07.160> shouldn't<00:03:07.820> be<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> perk<00:03:08.240> that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
your gun it shouldn't be a perk that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.390 
your gun it shouldn't be a perk that
should<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:08.930> be<00:03:08.990> there<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.470> think<00:03:09.830> scavenger

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
should just be there I think scavenger

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.010 
should just be there I think scavenger
should<00:03:11.030> make<00:03:11.240> it<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.720> can<00:03:11.870> pick<00:03:11.990> up

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
should make it so that you can pick up

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.080 
should make it so that you can pick up
your<00:03:12.200> fucking<00:03:12.380> grenades<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.070> bring<00:03:13.730> back<00:03:13.910> the
