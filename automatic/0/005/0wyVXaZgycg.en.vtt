then coming up to the headstock which I
think<00:02:07.850> looks<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.149> little<00:02:08.390> oversized<00:02:08.960> because

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
think looks a little oversized because

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.050 
think looks a little oversized because
of<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> angle<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.520> picture<00:02:10.880> has<00:02:11.000> been
