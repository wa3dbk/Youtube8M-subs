00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
lower mintage government bullion coins

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.920 
lower mintage government bullion coins
that<00:01:42.710> change<00:01:43.710> their<00:01:44.159> appearance<00:01:44.810> annually<00:01:45.810> I

think that's important to seeing a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.679 
think that's important to seeing a
premium<00:01:49.770> increase<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.420> can

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
premium increase that I think can

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109
