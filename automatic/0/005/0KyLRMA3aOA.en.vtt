short video to showcase another all in
one<00:00:14.759> brewing<00:00:15.599> design<00:00:16.220> today's<00:00:17.220> design<00:00:17.699> is

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
one brewing design today's design is

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.929 
one brewing design today's design is
actually<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:19.050> wide<00:00:19.439> or<00:00:20.189> should<00:00:20.550> say<00:00:20.670> one

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
actually just one wide or should say one

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.750 
actually just one wide or should say one
deep<00:00:21.439> three<00:00:22.439> tall<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.730> 12<00:00:24.510> 13<00:00:25.289> 14<00:00:25.760> deep

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
deep three tall and then 12 13 14 deep

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
deep three tall and then 12 13 14 deep
that's<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:27.810> part<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> have

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that's the all in one part you have

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
that's the all in one part you have
every<00:00:28.920> ingredient<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.670> need<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:31.140> works

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
every ingredient that you need it works

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.270 
every ingredient that you need it works
very<00:00:31.500> similar<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.660> here

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
very similar to this one right here

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.680 
very similar to this one right here
actually<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.760> work<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.239> much<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
actually they all work pretty much the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
actually they all work pretty much the
same<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:38.190> only<00:00:38.219> difference<00:00:38.460> between<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
same the only difference between this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.780 
same the only difference between this
one<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.860> far<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
one and this one is a as far as like is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.959 
one and this one is a as far as like is
the<00:00:42.090> design<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> placement<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> hoppers

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the design the placement of the hoppers

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.319 
the design the placement of the hoppers
the<00:00:46.280> choppers<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.460> facing<00:00:47.879> upward<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:50.329> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the choppers are facing upward and the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.260 
the choppers are facing upward and the
location<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.289> item<00:00:52.770> frames<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.969> find

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
location of these item frames and I find

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.060 
location of these item frames and I find
the<00:00:54.420> location<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> item<00:00:55.050> frames<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.920> be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the location of the item frames to be

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.959 
the location of the item frames to be
much<00:00:56.489> better<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.460> would<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
much better up here then it would be to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
much better up here then it would be to
be<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.300> front<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.199> droppers<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
be in front of these droppers because it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.759 
be in front of these droppers because it
can<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.820> difficult<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:04.049> sit<00:01:04.530> here

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
can be a little difficult to sit here

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.359 
can be a little difficult to sit here
and<00:01:05.000> try<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:06.960> locate<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and try to you know locate the the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.810 
and try to you know locate the the
dropper<00:01:08.790> behind<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:10.260> item<00:01:11.040> frame<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
dropper behind the item frame so this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.780 
dropper behind the item frame so this
kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> opens<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.640> also

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
kind of opens that up a bit you can also

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
kind of opens that up a bit you can also
put<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.360> item<00:01:15.659> frames<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> bottom

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
put these item frames down at the bottom

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.170 
put these item frames down at the bottom
here<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.700> either<00:01:17.970> way<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:19.439> easy

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
here you know either way be pretty easy

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.490 
here you know either way be pretty easy
now<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> guys<00:01:21.930> may<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.170> thinking

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
now some of you guys may be thinking

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.910 
now some of you guys may be thinking
well<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> buttons<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.030> none

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
well the buttons kind of make it none

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.380 
well the buttons kind of make it none
three<00:01:25.920> wide<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:27.210> non<00:01:27.650> one<00:01:28.650> deep<00:01:29.119> well<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
three wide or non one deep well you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
three wide or non one deep well you
could<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> same<00:01:31.229> respect<00:01:31.650> replace<00:01:32.159> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
could in the same respect replace this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.050 
could in the same respect replace this
down<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:34.280> replace<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.119> lever<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
down here replace that with a lever and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.940 
down here replace that with a lever and
that<00:01:39.060> right<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:40.259> cause<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that right there will actually cause a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.950 
that right there will actually cause a
you<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.520> an<00:01:41.640> update<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.540> trigger<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you know an update you trigger that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
you know an update you trigger that
that'll<00:01:43.799> that'll<00:01:44.100> work<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.579> same<00:01:44.759> way<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that'll that'll work the same way as a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
that'll that'll work the same way as a
button<00:01:45.450> attached<00:01:46.079> right<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.710> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
button attached right here so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
button attached right here so
technically<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.000> could<00:01:48.240> still<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.899> wide

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
technically it could still be one wide

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.330 
technically it could still be one wide
and<00:01:50.329> since<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.689> put<00:01:51.869> levers<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.950> half

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and since you can put levers on half

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.630 
and since you can put levers on half
slabs<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> three<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> half

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
slabs you can have it three and a half

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690 
slabs you can have it three and a half
high<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> little<00:01:59.399> stipulation

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
high that's just a little stipulation

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.639 
high that's just a little stipulation
anyways<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:02.450> let<00:02:03.450> me<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.659> ahead<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.960> brew<00:02:04.409> some

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
anyways so let me go ahead and brew some

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.139 
anyways so let me go ahead and brew some
up<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.100> guys<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:05.700> I'll<00:02:05.820> show<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
up for you guys and then I'll show you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.820 
up for you guys and then I'll show you
an<00:02:06.899> idea<00:02:07.259> i<00:02:07.320> had<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.979> sorting<00:02:08.789> system<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.560> let's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
an idea i had on sorting system so let's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
an idea i had on sorting system so let's
let's<00:02:11.129> make<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
let's make a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570 
let's make a
shoot<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.420> don't<00:02:13.600> know<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.890> speed<00:02:14.890> potion<00:02:15.100> I've

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
shoot I don't know a speed potion I've

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.160 
shoot I don't know a speed potion I've
actually<00:02:15.820> started<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.390> memorize<00:02:16.840> some<00:02:17.080> of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
actually started to memorize some of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.380 
actually started to memorize some of
these<00:02:17.260> some<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.220> these<00:02:18.310> things<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.850> then

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
these some of these things and then

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.820 
these some of these things and then
redstone<00:02:20.170> extends<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:23.080> Gunpowder

redstone extends it and the Gunpowder
what<00:02:24.130> makes<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.550> splash<00:02:24.850> potion<00:02:25.410> everything

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
what makes it a splash potion everything

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.350 
what makes it a splash potion everything
should<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.860> here<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.240> not<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:29.050> huh

potion yeah I had destroyed this bottle

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.570 
potion yeah I had destroyed this bottle
and<00:02:40.810> they<00:02:40.930> fell<00:02:41.260> into<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.710> thing<00:02:41.950> that's<00:02:42.250> too

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
and they fell into the thing that's too

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.190 
and they fell into the thing that's too
funny<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.990> anyways<00:02:44.290> guys<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> my<00:02:46.660> idea<00:02:46.810> wow

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
funny but anyways guys so my idea wow

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.640 
funny but anyways guys so my idea wow
that's<00:02:47.410> growing<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:49.570> put<00:02:49.840> my<00:02:50.050> sorting

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
that's growing up is to put my sorting

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.280 
that's growing up is to put my sorting
system<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.430> back<00:02:51.640> here<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.240> if<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.140> guys

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
system on the back here and if you guys

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.810 
system on the back here and if you guys
don't<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.620> how<00:02:53.740> my<00:02:53.890> sorting<00:02:54.250> system<00:02:54.610> works

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
don't know how my sorting system works

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.270 
don't know how my sorting system works
let's<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:56.380> know<00:02:56.500> balls<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.070> wall

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
let's just you know balls to the wall

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.280 
let's just you know balls to the wall
let's<00:02:57.520> head<00:02:57.640> over<00:02:57.670> here<00:02:58.000> real<00:02:58.120> quick<00:03:03.450> ok<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:05.170> my

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
let's head over here real quick ok so my

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.720 
let's head over here real quick ok so my
sorting<00:03:05.620> system<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.340> basic<00:03:06.700> unit

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
sorting system this is the basic unit

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.910 
sorting system this is the basic unit
right<00:03:07.210> here<00:03:07.410> ok<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.710> would<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:10.920> you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
right here ok so you would have this you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920 
right here ok so you would have this you
have<00:03:12.160> your<00:03:12.430> your<00:03:12.850> filter<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.780> your

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
have your your filter this is your

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.620 
have your your filter this is your
filter<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.470> then<00:03:15.040> below<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.150> would<00:03:16.390> have

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
filter and then below it you would have

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.080 
filter and then below it you would have
the<00:03:17.080> or<00:03:17.440> facing<00:03:18.190> into<00:03:18.490> it<00:03:18.580> i<00:03:18.670> should<00:03:18.880> say<00:03:19.030> you

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
the or facing into it i should say you

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.360 
the or facing into it i should say you
would<00:03:19.330> have<00:03:19.510> your<00:03:19.750> stuff<00:03:19.990> i<00:03:20.740> think<00:03:21.100> there's<00:03:21.280> a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
would have your stuff i think there's a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.190 
would have your stuff i think there's a
better<00:03:21.640> way<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.940> do<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.360> then<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.780> system

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
better way to do this then this system

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.900 
better way to do this then this system
but<00:03:23.350> i'm<00:03:23.950> just<00:03:24.010> showing<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.430> guys<00:03:24.580> an<00:03:24.820> example

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
but i'm just showing you guys an example

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.250 
but i'm just showing you guys an example
of<00:03:25.510> what<00:03:25.870> I'm<00:03:25.960> talking<00:03:26.260> about<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.810> over

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
of what I'm talking about and then over

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.110 
of what I'm talking about and then over
here<00:03:29.680> actually<00:03:30.010> no<00:03:30.340> actually<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.730> was<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
here actually no actually that was the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.090 
here actually no actually that was the
most<00:03:31.270> compact<00:03:31.630> way<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.230> now<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.070> I

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
most compact way to do it now that I

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.630 
most compact way to do it now that I
think<00:03:33.190> about<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:34.800> yeah<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.920> was<00:03:36.130> actually<00:03:36.610> the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
think about it yeah it was actually the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.450 
think about it yeah it was actually the
most<00:03:36.880> compact<00:03:37.240> way<00:03:37.740> but<00:03:38.740> yeah<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:39.160> use<00:03:39.430> that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
most compact way but yeah you use that

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.810 
most compact way but yeah you use that
design<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:41.590> just<00:03:41.800> make<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.190> filter<00:03:42.670> for

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
design and you just make a filter for

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.880 
design and you just make a filter for
each<00:03:43.030> one<00:03:43.360> you'll<00:03:44.200> have<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.590> use<00:03:44.790> mmm<00:03:45.790> 22<00:03:46.660> items

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
each one you'll have to use mmm 22 items

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.760 
each one you'll have to use mmm 22 items
as<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.980> filter<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:49.210> can<00:03:49.240> use<00:03:49.810> placeholders<00:03:50.530> in

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
as a filter you can use placeholders in

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.460 
as a filter you can use placeholders in
here<00:03:51.240> so<00:03:52.240> when<00:03:52.390> you're<00:03:52.480> making<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.810> filter<00:03:53.170> and

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
here so when you're making a filter and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.620 
here so when you're making a filter and
let<00:03:54.430> me<00:03:54.520> put<00:03:54.730> some<00:03:54.760> hoppers<00:03:55.270> hear<00:03:55.450> what<00:03:55.570> I'm

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
let me put some hoppers hear what I'm

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.750 
let me put some hoppers hear what I'm
showing<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.960> guys<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.740> facing<00:03:57.280> inward<00:03:57.580> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
showing you guys so facing inward and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.250 
showing you guys so facing inward and
then<00:03:58.180> you'd<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.630> water<00:03:58.930> source

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
then you'd have like a water source

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.800 
then you'd have like a water source
going<00:03:59.560> through<00:04:00.340> here<00:04:00.550> with<00:04:01.270> items<00:04:01.570> going

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
going through here with items going

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.020 
going through here with items going
through<00:04:01.990> but<00:04:02.770> in<00:04:02.920> here<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.370> would<00:04:03.490> have<00:04:03.700> let's

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
through but in here you would have let's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.540 
through but in here you would have let's
say<00:04:04.180> fits<00:04:04.420> hoppers<00:04:05.010> instead<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.130> doing<00:04:06.400> like

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
say fits hoppers instead of doing like

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.230 
say fits hoppers instead of doing like
oops<00:04:06.970> oops<00:04:07.180> oops<00:04:07.540> oops<00:04:07.750> oops<00:04:09.030> that's<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
oops oops oops oops oops that's the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.960 
oops oops oops oops oops that's the
whole<00:04:10.420> point<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.900> locking<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.590> thing<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:12.820> let

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
whole point of locking that thing so let

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.210 
whole point of locking that thing so let
me<00:04:13.000> show<00:04:13.240> you<00:04:13.270> this<00:04:13.630> right<00:04:13.930> here<00:04:14.170> instead<00:04:14.950> of

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
me show you this right here instead of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.330 
me show you this right here instead of
putting<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:17.410> whole<00:04:17.620> system<00:04:18.040> with

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
putting like the the whole system with

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.979 
putting like the the whole system with
hoppers<00:04:18.760> which<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.180> would<00:04:19.270> do<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.630> just<00:04:19.750> put

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
hoppers which you would do is just put

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.700 
hoppers which you would do is just put
two<00:04:20.230> hot<00:04:20.500> birds<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:21.010> here<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:22.750> then<00:04:23.110> these

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
two hot birds in here and then these

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.730 
two hot birds in here and then these
would<00:04:24.070> be<00:04:24.840> items<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.110> wouldn't<00:04:26.380> have

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
would be items that you wouldn't have

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.219 
would be items that you wouldn't have
your<00:04:26.889> system<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.669> would<00:04:27.819> have<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.240> 20

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
your system and you would have like 20

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.230 
your system and you would have like 20
or<00:04:29.860> something<00:04:30.250> yeah<00:04:31.150> 20<00:04:32.110> something<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:32.680> that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
or something yeah 20 something like that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.939 
or something yeah 20 something like that
yeah<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.509> that<00:04:34.810> would<00:04:34.960> be<00:04:35.289> your<00:04:35.410> filter<00:04:35.770> so

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
yeah and that would be your filter so

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:36.990 
yeah and that would be your filter so
this<00:04:36.069> way<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.250> wouldn't<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.639> use

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
this way you wouldn't have to use

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.210 
this way you wouldn't have to use
ingredients<00:04:37.240> as<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.990> filter<00:04:38.349> too<00:04:38.560> much<00:04:38.740> um

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
ingredients as the filter too much um

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.670 
ingredients as the filter too much um
and<00:04:40.180> then<00:04:40.690> yeah<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.289> was<00:04:41.319> sort<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:41.620> my

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
and then yeah so that was sort of my

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.920 
and then yeah so that was sort of my
idea<00:04:42.009> for<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.340> automatic<00:04:42.789> sorting<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:43.750> that

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
idea for the automatic sorting but that

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.270 
idea for the automatic sorting but that
kind<00:04:44.139> of<00:04:44.199> brings<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.590> out<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.770> little<00:04:44.979> bit<00:04:45.099> it

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
kind of brings it out a little bit it

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.999 
kind of brings it out a little bit it
actually<00:04:45.639> brings<00:04:45.819> it<00:04:46.060> out<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:47.020> about<00:04:47.050> here

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
actually brings it out to about here

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.559 
actually brings it out to about here
because<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.430> have<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.699> have<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:50.729> spot<00:04:51.729> to<00:04:51.970> block

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
because you have to have a spot to block

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.529 
because you have to have a spot to block
off<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.960> water<00:04:53.199> so<00:04:53.530> other<00:04:54.160> net<00:04:54.490> but<00:04:54.729> but<00:04:55.210> still

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
off the water so other net but but still

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.249 
off the water so other net but but still
it<00:04:55.810> is<00:04:55.960> like<00:04:56.490> completely<00:04:57.490> compact<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.449> I<00:04:59.080> may

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
it is like completely compact and I may

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.620 
it is like completely compact and I may
release<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> video<00:04:59.860> with<00:05:00.370> automatic<00:05:01.060> sorting<00:05:01.449> I

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
release a video with automatic sorting I

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.350 
release a video with automatic sorting I
may<00:05:02.199> do<00:05:02.319> that<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:02.680> who<00:05:02.830> knows<00:05:03.000> but<00:05:04.000> yeah<00:05:04.150> let's
