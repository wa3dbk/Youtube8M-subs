it's<00:04:04.580> all<00:04:04.700> factory<00:04:05.270> two<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.490> might<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.800> might

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
it's all factory two so I might I might

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.850 
it's all factory two so I might I might
build<00:04:10.220> not<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.120> year<00:04:11.510> but<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.350> will<00:04:12.620> need<00:04:12.830> a

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
build not this year but I will need a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.530 
build not this year but I will need a
lot<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.100> storage<00:04:13.430> for<00:04:13.730> supplies<00:04:14.090> when<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.390> do

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
lot of storage for supplies when I do

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.660 
lot of storage for supplies when I do
leave<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.740> I<00:04:15.800> was<00:04:16.010> thinking<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.460> putting

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
leave so I was thinking of putting

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.870 
leave so I was thinking of putting
shelves<00:04:17.270> on<00:04:17.870> top<00:04:18.169> here<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:19.549> building

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
shelves on top here and just building

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.810 
shelves on top here and just building
shelves<00:04:20.210> across<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:21.049> going<00:04:21.320> up<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.400> can<00:04:22.580> put

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
shelves across and going up so I can put

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.650 
shelves across and going up so I can put
my<00:04:23.000> my<00:04:23.990> supplies<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:25.419> think<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.479> would<00:04:26.570> be

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
my my supplies I think it would be

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.219 
my my supplies I think it would be
better<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:28.390> don't<00:04:29.390> think<00:04:29.540> I'll<00:04:29.660> be<00:04:29.750> using<00:04:29.780> that

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
better I don't think I'll be using that

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.490 
better I don't think I'll be using that
much<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:31.040> mean<00:04:31.220> I'll<00:04:31.310> stop<00:04:31.640> somewhere<00:04:32.030> ISM<00:04:32.500> but

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
much I mean I'll stop somewhere ISM but

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.680 
much I mean I'll stop somewhere ISM but
nothing<00:04:34.490> I'll<00:04:34.610> be<00:04:34.729> building<00:04:35.120> shelves<00:04:35.390> instead

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
nothing I'll be building shelves instead

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:48.670 
nothing I'll be building shelves instead
so<00:04:38.690> if<00:04:38.930> we<00:04:39.050> come<00:04:39.320> around<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.800> way<00:04:47.350> we<00:04:48.350> got<00:04:48.470> two

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
so if we come around this way we got two

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.000 
so if we come around this way we got two
