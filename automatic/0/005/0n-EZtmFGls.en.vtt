sequences<00:00:47.879> much<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.360> books<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
sequences much like books but a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.490 
sequences much like books but a
connectome<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> network<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
connectome is more like a network so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
connectome is more like a network so
it's<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> simple<00:00:53.340> one-dimensional<00:00:53.789> object

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's not a simple one-dimensional object

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.650 
it's not a simple one-dimensional object
it's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.079> tangled<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.710> web<00:00:56.059> like<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> internet

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it's a tangled up web like the internet

one<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> major<00:00:59.070> slogans<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.270> book<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
one of the major slogans of this book is

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
one of the major slogans of this book is
that<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:02.100> than<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.430> genes<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that you are more than your genes you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
that you are more than your genes you
are<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.870> connectome<00:01:05.420> everyone<00:01:06.830> knows<00:01:07.830> about

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
are your connectome everyone knows about

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.100 
are your connectome everyone knows about
the<00:01:08.310> power<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.909> genes<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.570> influence<00:01:09.990> your

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the power of the genes to influence your

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
the power of the genes to influence your
destiny<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.280> look<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:12.030> tall<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
destiny the way you look how tall you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.490 
destiny the way you look how tall you
are<00:01:13.010> what<00:01:14.010> diseases<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.640> might<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.500> but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
are what diseases you might get but

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
are what diseases you might get but
intuitively<00:01:16.830> people<00:01:17.520> also<00:01:17.700> grasp<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.630> not

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
intuitively people also grasp that's not

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
intuitively people also grasp that's not
all<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.939> memory<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> your

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
all there is to it your memory of your

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.219 
all there is to it your memory of your
first<00:01:21.869> kiss<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.100> genome

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
first kiss that's not in your genome

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.660 
first kiss that's not in your genome
because<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.530> genome<00:01:25.890> hasn't<00:01:26.250> changed<00:01:26.610> since

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
because your genome hasn't changed since

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.510 
because your genome hasn't changed since
you<00:01:26.850> were<00:01:26.880> born<00:01:27.829> somehow<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.890> memory<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you were born somehow that memory is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.499 
you were born somehow that memory is
inside<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.450> brain<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> where<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.509> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
inside your brain and where is that it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
inside your brain and where is that it
might<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.079> connectome<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.950> pattern

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
might be in your connectome the pattern

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
might be in your connectome the pattern
of<00:01:35.670> connections<00:01:36.180> between<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.750> brains

of connections between your brains

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.859 
of connections between your brains
neurons<00:01:37.640> what<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.909> hope<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> learn<00:01:39.450> what

being made in Alzheimer's disease and
Parkinson's<00:01:46.380> disease<00:01:46.880> because<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.329> in

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
Parkinson's disease because we know in

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.440 
Parkinson's disease because we know in
those<00:01:48.689> cases<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.530> neurons<00:01:50.520> degenerate<00:01:51.180> and

those cases that neurons degenerate and
die<00:01:51.689> there's<00:01:52.619> clear<00:01:52.979> evidence<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
die there's clear evidence that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.330 
die there's clear evidence that
something<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.210> wrong<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> brain

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
something is going wrong in the brain

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.780 
something is going wrong in the brain
but<00:01:56.340> most<00:01:56.610> mental<00:01:57.030> disorders<00:01:57.509> schizophrenia

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
but most mental disorders schizophrenia

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.969 
but most mental disorders schizophrenia
bipolar<00:01:59.790> disorder<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.619> look<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
bipolar disorder if you look at the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.520 
bipolar disorder if you look at the
brains<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.549> people<00:02:03.049> they<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.290> totally

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
brains of these people they look totally

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.710 
brains of these people they look totally
normal

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
normal

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.510 
normal
and<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.470> opinion<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.950> have<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.250> see

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
and so in my opinion you have to see

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.930 
and so in my opinion you have to see
what's<00:02:10.820> abnormal<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> chance<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
what's abnormal to have a chance of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.850 
what's abnormal to have a chance of
really<00:02:13.940> treating<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:14.900> even<00:02:15.080> curing<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
really treating it or even curing it and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.880 
really treating it or even curing it and
that's<00:02:16.700> what<00:02:17.230> studying<00:02:18.230> connectomes<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.770> all

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
that's what studying connectomes is all

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
answers about how to live your life we

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.250 
answers about how to live your life we
may<00:02:33.680> not<00:02:33.890> give<00:02:34.130> satisfying<00:02:34.790> once<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:36.110> we

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
may not give satisfying once but we

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.410 
may not give satisfying once but we
believe<00:02:36.650> strongly<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.220> we<00:02:37.610> will<00:02:38.030> have<00:02:38.060> those

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
believe strongly that we will have those

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.699 
believe strongly that we will have those
answers<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.770> science<00:02:40.190> will<00:02:40.340> progress<00:02:40.550> and

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
answers that science will progress and

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.060 
answers that science will progress and
I'd<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.040> have<00:02:43.190> people<00:02:44.530> understand<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
I'd like to have people understand the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.949 
I'd like to have people understand the
quest<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.520> we're<00:02:46.700> on<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.120> actually<00:02:47.300> join<00:02:47.780> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
quest that we're on and actually join in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.110 
quest that we're on and actually join in
that<00:02:48.080> quest<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.680> understand<00:02:49.430> ourselves<00:02:49.550> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
that quest to understand ourselves and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.030 
that quest to understand ourselves and
to<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> means<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.560> change<00:02:51.650> ourselves

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
to have the means to change ourselves

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.000 
to have the means to change ourselves
for<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.730> better<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.870> when<00:02:57.050> I<00:02:57.080> first<00:02:57.470> started

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
for the better so when I first started

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.490 
for the better so when I first started
out<00:02:58.160> studying<00:02:58.459> neuroscience<00:02:59.300> I<00:03:00.020> was<00:03:00.260> driven

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
out studying neuroscience I was driven

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.880 
out studying neuroscience I was driven
purely<00:03:00.950> by<00:03:01.480> curiosity<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.680> Greek

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
purely by curiosity the Greek

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.090 
purely by curiosity the Greek
philosophers<00:03:04.430> said<00:03:04.640> know<00:03:04.910> thyself<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
philosophers said know thyself and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.780 
philosophers said know thyself and
neuroscience<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.190> about<00:03:07.459> knowing<00:03:08.030> yourself

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
neuroscience is about knowing yourself

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.690 
neuroscience is about knowing yourself
but<00:03:10.790> now<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.860> think<00:03:13.130> much<00:03:13.519> of<00:03:13.550> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
but now I and I think much of the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.479 
but now I and I think much of the
neuroscience<00:03:14.209> community<00:03:14.330> has<00:03:14.989> also<00:03:15.890> thought

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
neuroscience community has also thought

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.680 
neuroscience community has also thought
more<00:03:16.760> about<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.150> practical<00:03:17.600> implications

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
more about the practical implications

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.910 
more about the practical implications
not<00:03:18.440> just<00:03:19.340> know<00:03:19.940> thyself<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.959> how<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.709> i

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
not just know thyself but how can i

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.979 
not just know thyself but how can i
change<00:03:22.220> myself<00:03:22.550> how<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:23.420> we<00:03:23.540> change<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
change myself how can we change the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.400 
change myself how can we change the
brains<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.620> other<00:03:24.769> people<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.180> really

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
brains of other people this is really

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.470 
brains of other people this is really
the<00:03:27.410> practical<00:03:27.830> consequence<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.480> knowledge

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
the practical consequence of knowledge

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.400 
the practical consequence of knowledge
about<00:03:29.769> what<00:03:30.769> we<00:03:30.920> are<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.989> question<00:03:33.110> a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
about what we are so the question a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.430 
about what we are so the question a
change<00:03:33.769> has<00:03:34.190> become<00:03:34.640> much<00:03:35.000> more<00:03:35.350> important<00:03:36.350> in

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
change has become much more important in

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.530 
change has become much more important in
my<00:03:36.620> mind<00:03:36.890> than<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.190> used<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.400> be<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.790> believe

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
my mind than it used to be I believe

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.050 
my mind than it used to be I believe
that<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.110> quest<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.560> know<00:03:39.739> ourselves<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.640> to

that the quest to know ourselves and to

that the quest to know ourselves and to
change<00:03:41.600> ourselves<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.500> one<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.489> most

change ourselves is one of the most

change ourselves is one of the most
exciting<00:03:44.120> stories<00:03:44.890> for<00:03:45.890> Humanity
