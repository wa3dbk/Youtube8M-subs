00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.469 
so yeah I'm doing is just getting it
down<00:04:59.220> there<00:04:59.690> so<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.870> can't<00:05:01.260> see<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:02.479> section

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
down there so you can't see the section

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.339 
down there so you can't see the section
of<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.050> hair<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.419> that<00:05:06.599> will<00:05:06.750> look<00:05:06.840> like<00:05:06.900> this

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
of the hair so that will look like this

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.700 
of the hair so that will look like this
is<00:05:07.500> an<00:05:07.800> all-natural<00:05:08.190> style<00:05:09.560> there's<00:05:10.560> one
