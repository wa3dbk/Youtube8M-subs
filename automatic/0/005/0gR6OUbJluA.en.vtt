 It is a gasoline engine of the telephone hole 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.130
 Especially the degree is good 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.550

 We have Yatsuko together 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.470
 Fine, but the car is really usually drag feeling 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.560
 This cloth 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.560

 The woman counter will come out 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.110

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.800
 Such feeling and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.800
 Ghan and the mirror 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:50.400
