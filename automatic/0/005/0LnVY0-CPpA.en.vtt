00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
to me and so I thought to myself why did

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.940 
to me and so I thought to myself why did
it<00:02:09.250> not<00:02:09.369> matter

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
it not matter

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
me that that person had me to comment

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.940 
me that that person had me to comment
about<00:02:11.750> me<00:02:11.959> looking<00:02:12.230> better<00:02:12.379> with<00:02:12.620> longer<00:02:12.920> hair

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
about me looking better with longer hair

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.190 
about me looking better with longer hair
and<00:02:13.459> why<00:02:14.030> didn't<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.420> bother<00:02:14.599> me<00:02:14.840> because<00:02:14.989> I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and why didn't it bother me because I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.460 
and why didn't it bother me because I
know<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:16.450> before<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:18.019> would<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.290> made<00:02:18.440> a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
know that before it would have made a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.960 
know that before it would have made a
difference<00:02:18.920> especially<00:02:19.129> when<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.580> first<00:02:19.819> got

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
difference especially when I first got

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.820 
difference especially when I first got
my<00:02:20.030> hair<00:02:20.330> cut<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:21.080> would<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.379> made<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.560> huge

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
my hair cut it would have made a huge

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.020 
my hair cut it would have made a huge
difference<00:02:21.980> if<00:02:22.280> someone<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.670> telling<00:02:22.819> me<00:02:23.000> that

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
difference if someone is telling me that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.180 
difference if someone is telling me that
I<00:02:23.180> looked<00:02:23.510> better<00:02:23.660> with<00:02:23.870> longer<00:02:24.170> hair<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.650> so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
I looked better with longer hair and so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.759 
I looked better with longer hair and so
in<00:02:25.790> thinking<00:02:26.030> about<00:02:26.269> why<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:27.170> didn't<00:02:27.470> affect

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
in thinking about why it didn't affect

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.800 
in thinking about why it didn't affect
me<00:02:27.920> much<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.340> came<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.150> with<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.330> couple<00:02:29.569> reasons

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
me much I came up with a couple reasons

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.780 
me much I came up with a couple reasons
why<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.230> didn't<00:02:30.680> matter<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.920> me<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.760> just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
why it didn't matter to me and I just

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.910
