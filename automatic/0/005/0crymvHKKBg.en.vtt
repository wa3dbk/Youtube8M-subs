DTS<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.549> had<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> misfire<00:00:06.810> code<00:00:07.200> which<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.770> p0

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
DTS I had a misfire code which was p0

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.910 
DTS I had a misfire code which was p0
303<00:00:09.389> which<00:00:09.840> means<00:00:10.170> cylinder<00:00:10.590> number<00:00:10.800> three

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
303 which means cylinder number three

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.220 
303 which means cylinder number three
with<00:00:11.639> misfiring<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> second

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
with misfiring and that is the second

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.310 
with misfiring and that is the second
one<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> back<00:00:13.889> over<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:15.020> okay<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
one on the back over here okay but I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.599 
one on the back over here okay but I
just<00:00:16.500> want<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> make<00:00:16.800> another<00:00:17.070> quick<00:00:17.220> repair

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
just want to make another quick repair

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
spark plugs to note you know change your

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880 
spark plugs to note you know change your
ignition<00:00:23.670> coil<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.600> your<00:00:24.779> Cadillac<00:00:25.140> DTS<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
ignition coil in your Cadillac DTS it is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.210 
ignition coil in your Cadillac DTS it is
very<00:00:26.130> simple<00:00:26.580> very<00:00:27.330> easy<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.980> one

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
very simple very easy to do you have one

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.609 
very simple very easy to do you have one
to<00:00:29.369> ten<00:00:29.789> millimeter<00:00:30.240> bolt<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.840> take

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to ten millimeter bolt right here take

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.950 
to ten millimeter bolt right here take
that<00:00:31.650> out<00:00:31.980> pop<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.579> coil<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> then

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that out pop up your coil and then

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.569 
that out pop up your coil and then
change<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> spark<00:00:34.590> plug<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.340> simple

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
change the spark plug it's that simple

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.330 
change the spark plug it's that simple
you<00:00:35.820> could<00:00:35.969> probably<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> front<00:00:36.750> set<00:00:37.020> up

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
you could probably do the front set up

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
you could probably do the front set up
probably<00:00:38.340> 10-15<00:00:39.149> minutes<00:00:39.450> yourself<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
probably 10-15 minutes yourself it is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.270 
probably 10-15 minutes yourself it is
that<00:00:40.379> easy<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:41.780> okay<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> had<00:00:43.860> cylinder

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that easy to do okay so I had cylinder

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.040 
that easy to do okay so I had cylinder
number<00:00:44.520> three<00:00:44.640> misfiring<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> one

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
number three misfiring which is this one

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920 
number three misfiring which is this one
right<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> put<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.329> put<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> new

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
right here so I put in this I put a new

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229 
right here so I put in this I put a new
spark<00:00:49.260> plug<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.219> did<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.789> solve<00:00:51.059> my

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
spark plug in it it did not solve my

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.779 
spark plug in it it did not solve my
problems<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> swapped<00:00:52.410> coils<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.100> number

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
problems so I swapped coils from number

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.160 
problems so I swapped coils from number
three<00:00:53.969> number<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:55.520> okay<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> code

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
three number one okay and the code

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
three number one okay and the code
immediately<00:00:58.980> jumped<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> number<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.180> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
immediately jumped to number one so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
immediately jumped to number one so
right<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> knew<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.469> ignition<00:01:01.739> coil

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
right then I knew that the ignition coil

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.420 
right then I knew that the ignition coil
was<00:01:02.430> bad<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.870> ordered<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> new<00:01:04.589> ignition<00:01:05.220> coil

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
was bad so I ordered a new ignition coil

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
was bad so I ordered a new ignition coil
put<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> has<00:01:06.479> soft<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:06.960> misfire

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
put it on and it has soft my misfire

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.179 
put it on and it has soft my misfire
problem<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> change<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.439> back<00:01:10.650> ones

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
problem so to change the back ones

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
problem so to change the back ones
let<00:01:11.790> me<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.920> change

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
let me see on your back here to change

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.130 
let me see on your back here to change
the<00:01:14.400> back<00:01:14.580> ones<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> 10<00:01:15.720> millimeter

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the back ones you have a 10 millimeter

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
the back ones you have a 10 millimeter
bolt<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.030> your

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
bolt right here and you have your

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
bolt right here and you have your
connector<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
connector right here you just want to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
connector right here you just want to
push<00:01:20.520> down<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> connector<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:21.810> pull

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
push down on the connector and then pull

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.760 
push down on the connector and then pull
out<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> coil<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.659> pop<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
out and then the coil will pop up and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.399 
out and then the coil will pop up and
you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.009> change<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> spark<00:01:26.580> plug<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:28.229> not

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you can change the spark plug it's not

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can change the spark plug it's not
too<00:01:28.590> hard<00:01:29.180> it's<00:01:30.180> pretty<00:01:30.390> easy<00:01:30.600> access<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.880> do

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
too hard it's pretty easy access to do

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.899 
too hard it's pretty easy access to do
this<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.619> over<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
this one to do this one over here you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
this one to do this one over here you
might<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.840> loosen<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> secondary

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
might have to loosen up the secondary

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.770 
might have to loosen up the secondary
air<00:01:38.430> valve<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.329> too<00:01:39.540> sure<00:01:39.750> I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
air valve right here I'm not too sure I

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.270 
air valve right here I'm not too sure I
have<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.229> looked<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.829> well<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
have not looked at it that well but I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.999 
have not looked at it that well but I
know<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.640> 2000<00:01:42.210> 2005<00:01:42.750> North<00:01:43.049> Star<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
know the 2000 2005 North Star you you

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.060 
know the 2000 2005 North Star you you
have<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.750> too<00:01:45.960> sure<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
have to but I'm not too sure but you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
have to but I'm not too sure but you
might<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.880> loosen<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
might have to just loosen this up and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.090 
might have to just loosen this up and
then<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> change<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:51.740> another<00:01:52.740> tip
