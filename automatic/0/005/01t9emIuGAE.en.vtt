pretty<00:01:42.439> that<00:01:42.740> was<00:01:42.859> pretty<00:01:43.069> hard<00:01:43.280> ok<00:01:43.819> so<00:01:44.119> I

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
pretty that was pretty hard ok so I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.010 
pretty that was pretty hard ok so I
guess<00:01:44.329> when<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.539> talk<00:01:44.689> about<00:01:44.840> performance

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
guess when we talk about performance

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.719 
guess when we talk about performance
it's<00:01:45.590> all<00:01:45.710> about<00:01:45.950> does<00:01:46.189> it<00:01:46.219> get<00:01:46.429> through<00:01:46.549> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
it's all about does it get through the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.399 
it's all about does it get through the
tree<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:47.389> it<00:01:47.539> really<00:01:47.899> does<00:01:48.109> come<00:01:48.380> down

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
tree and then it really does come down

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.830 
tree and then it really does come down
to<00:01:48.560> because<00:01:49.009> it's<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.280> cordless<00:01:49.609> about<00:01:50.479> battery

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
to because it's a cordless about battery

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.419 
to because it's a cordless about battery
life<00:01:50.929> as<00:01:51.229> well<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:51.530> let's<00:01:51.679> talk<00:01:51.829> about<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.249> out

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
life as well so let's talk about it out

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.940 
life as well so let's talk about it out
there<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.450> South<00:01:53.659> 40<00:01:54.020> how<00:01:54.289> did<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.530> perform

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
there in the South 40 how did it perform

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.039 
there in the South 40 how did it perform
yeah<00:01:55.459> better<00:01:55.700> life<00:01:55.969> is<00:01:56.179> where<00:01:56.389> the<00:01:56.630> downfall

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
yeah better life is where the downfall

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.179 
yeah better life is where the downfall
is<00:01:57.109> gonna<00:01:57.289> be<00:01:57.409> on<00:01:57.499> this<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.679> little<00:01:57.859> bit<00:01:58.009> because

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
is gonna be on this a little bit because

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.340 
is gonna be on this a little bit because
it<00:01:58.340> would<00:01:58.819> only<00:01:58.880> last<00:01:59.179> for<00:01:59.389> about<00:01:59.569> 15<00:02:00.020> minutes

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
it would only last for about 15 minutes

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.099 
it would only last for about 15 minutes
15<00:02:00.499> to<00:02:00.829> 20<00:02:01.189> minutes<00:02:01.600> cutting<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.689> maple<00:02:02.990> it's

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
15 to 20 minutes cutting the maple it's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.739 
15 to 20 minutes cutting the maple it's
gonna<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.560> was<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.859> lot<00:02:04.310> more<00:02:04.520> stress<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.299> so

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
gonna it was a lot more stress on it so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.020 
gonna it was a lot more stress on it so
the<00:02:06.259> battery<00:02:06.529> life<00:02:06.560> was<00:02:07.189> decreased<00:02:07.609> quite<00:02:07.969> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the battery life was decreased quite a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.969 
the battery life was decreased quite a
bit<00:02:08.209> as<00:02:08.330> well<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.780> okay<00:02:09.380> let's<00:02:09.860> talk

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
bit as well on that okay let's talk

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
bit as well on that okay let's talk
about<00:02:10.039> design<00:02:10.520> because<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.940> guess<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.240> first

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
about design because I guess the first

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.149 
about design because I guess the first
thing<00:02:11.540> I'd<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.990> ask<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.920> there<00:02:13.129> a

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
thing I'd have to ask you is is there a

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.860 
thing I'd have to ask you is is there a
battery<00:02:13.459> indicator<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.180> back<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.689> you<00:02:14.780> can

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
battery indicator on the back so you can

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.929 
battery indicator on the back so you can
kind<00:02:15.049> of<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> sense<00:02:15.349> where<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:15.890> are<00:02:16.189> no

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
kind of get a sense where you are no

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.280 
kind of get a sense where you are no
battery<00:02:17.269> indicator<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:17.959> it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
battery indicator on it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
battery indicator on it
sense<00:02:18.620> comes<00:02:18.890> from<00:02:19.189> it's<00:02:19.370> starting<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.819> bog

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
sense comes from it's starting to bog

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.399 
sense comes from it's starting to bog
down<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.599> tell<00:02:20.810> pretty<00:02:20.930> quickly<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
down you can tell pretty quickly that

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.080 
down you can tell pretty quickly that
the<00:02:21.500> battery<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.799> giving<00:02:22.099> out<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.670> this

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the battery is giving out on it this

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.619 
the battery is giving out on it this
night<00:02:23.299> cat<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.629> just<00:02:23.750> goes<00:02:24.760> right<00:02:25.760> okay<00:02:26.569> so

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
night cat it just goes right okay so

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.539 
night cat it just goes right okay so
take<00:02:26.900> me<00:02:27.019> around<00:02:27.109> the<00:02:27.349> Machine<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.189> give

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
take me around the Machine and just give

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.679 
take me around the Machine and just give
me<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> tour<00:02:28.879> tell<00:02:29.150> me<00:02:29.209> what<00:02:29.329> you<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.540> and

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
me a tour tell me what you like and

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:30.039 
me a tour tell me what you like and
don't<00:02:29.750> like

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
don't like

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.750 
don't like
I<00:02:30.079> felt<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.650> solid<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:31.250> comfortable

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I felt really solid it's comfortable

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.050 
I felt really solid it's comfortable
it's<00:02:32.060> balanced<00:02:32.629> well<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:34.430> small<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:34.970> I'm

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
it's balanced well it's small so I'm

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.179 
it's balanced well it's small so I'm
able<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.329> get<00:02:35.510> into<00:02:35.810> those<00:02:35.930> real<00:02:36.379> small<00:02:36.829> areas

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
able to get into those real small areas

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.160 
able to get into those real small areas
which<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.519> which<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.120> did<00:02:38.269> add<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.510> kind<00:02:38.689> of<00:02:38.750> climb

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
which I which I did add to kind of climb

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.500 
which I which I did add to kind of climb
into<00:02:39.379> my<00:02:39.470> trees<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.159> and<00:02:40.430> start<00:02:41.150> cutting<00:02:41.299> him

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
into my trees and and start cutting him

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.550 
into my trees and and start cutting him
up<00:02:41.629> so<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.920> was<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.280> was<00:02:43.400> excellent

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
up so for that it was it was excellent

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.740 
up so for that it was it was excellent
being<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.650> novice<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:47.000> first<00:02:47.209> couple<00:02:47.510> times<00:02:47.599> I

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
being a novice the first couple times I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.720 
being a novice the first couple times I
was<00:02:47.870> grabbing<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.469> the<00:02:48.739> guard<00:02:48.980> here<00:02:49.340> rather

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
was grabbing the the guard here rather

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.750 
was grabbing the the guard here rather
than<00:02:49.969> this<00:02:50.180> right<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.129> quickly<00:02:52.489> learned

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
than this right but I quickly learned

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.300 
than this right but I quickly learned
that<00:02:52.939> that's<00:02:53.720> what<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.049> I<00:02:54.139> needed<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.620> be

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
that that's what what I needed to be

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.479 
that that's what what I needed to be
grabbing<00:02:55.549> yeah<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.819> want<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.090> behind<00:02:56.480> it

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
grabbing yeah you want to be behind it

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.349 
grabbing yeah you want to be behind it
yeah<00:02:58.489> exactly

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
yeah exactly

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.119 
yeah exactly
okay<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:02:59.720> gonna<00:02:59.810> pull<00:03:00.049> this<00:03:00.169> off<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.409> uh<00:03:00.650> it's

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
okay I'm gonna pull this off and uh it's

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.589 
okay I'm gonna pull this off and uh it's
got<00:03:01.280> charge<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.819> start<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.150> up<00:03:02.209> for<00:03:02.419> me<00:03:02.540> if

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
got charge to it start it up for me if

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.270 
got charge to it start it up for me if
you<00:03:02.689> would<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.859> take<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.220> little

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
you would you just take this little

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.860 
you would you just take this little
button<00:03:04.639> you<00:03:04.669> push<00:03:04.909> it<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.239> as<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.389> safety<00:03:05.599> thing

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
button you push it in as a safety thing

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.869 
button you push it in as a safety thing
and<00:03:08.169> quiet<00:03:09.169> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.349> set<00:03:09.590> well<00:03:10.129> it's<00:03:10.489> not<00:03:10.700> loud

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
and quiet on the set well it's not loud

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.869 
and quiet on the set well it's not loud
certainly<00:03:11.510> not<00:03:11.919> so<00:03:12.919> you<00:03:12.980> could<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:13.340> out<00:03:13.519> early

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
certainly not so you could get out early

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.220 
certainly not so you could get out early
in<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.000> morning<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.419> probably<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.049> work

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
in the morning and probably do the work

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.349 
in the morning and probably do the work
without<00:03:15.639> making<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:16.700> neighbors<00:03:16.970> mad<00:03:17.150> right

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
without making the neighbors mad right

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.199 
without making the neighbors mad right
okay<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:17.959> what<00:03:18.139> about<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.709> oil<00:03:18.739> function<00:03:19.639> you

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
okay so what about the oil function you

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.940 
okay so what about the oil function you
had<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.599> do<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.200> even<00:03:21.829> though<00:03:21.889> it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
had you do have to even though it's

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.559 
had you do have to even though it's
electric<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.609> do<00:03:22.729> have<00:03:22.909> to<00:03:23.030> keep<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.359> chain

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
electric you do have to keep the chain

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.780 
electric you do have to keep the chain
lubricated<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.500> there<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> little<00:03:25.340> bulb<00:03:25.579> on

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
lubricated so there is a little bulb on

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.789 
lubricated so there is a little bulb on
top<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.239> prime<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.810> yeah<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.409> have<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.560> push

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
top to prime that yeah you have to push

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.339 
top to prime that yeah you have to push
it<00:03:27.829> once<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.400> twice<00:03:28.430> every<00:03:28.699> 20<00:03:29.479> to<00:03:29.599> 30<00:03:29.870> seconds

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
it once or twice every 20 to 30 seconds

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.309 
it once or twice every 20 to 30 seconds
of<00:03:30.470> operation<00:03:31.129> it's<00:03:31.729> a<00:03:31.819> manual<00:03:32.239> one<00:03:32.479> so<00:03:32.959> you

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
of operation it's a manual one so you

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.379 
of operation it's a manual one so you
have<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.590> remember<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:34.069> do<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.370> okay<00:03:34.879> I<00:03:35.030> see<00:03:35.359> a

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
have to remember to do it okay I see a

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.390 
have to remember to do it okay I see a
little<00:03:35.599> bit<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.750> oil<00:03:35.900> here<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.260> there<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.949> when

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
little bit of oil here and there it when

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.520 
little bit of oil here and there it when
I<00:03:37.430> picked<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:37.909> up<00:03:38.000> off<00:03:38.180> my<00:03:38.419> workbench<00:03:39.139> I<00:03:39.319> saw

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
I picked it up off my workbench I saw

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.409 
I picked it up off my workbench I saw
this<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:39.769> puddle<00:03:40.639> of<00:03:40.819> oil<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.269> it

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
this little puddle of oil on it

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.409 
this little puddle of oil on it
obviously<00:03:42.199> continues<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.849> leak<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.209> the

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
obviously continues to to leak out the

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.759 
obviously continues to to leak out the
bottom<00:03:44.720> well<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.079> guess<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.379> know<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
bottom well I guess you know as the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.710 
bottom well I guess you know as the
blade<00:03:45.979> is<00:03:46.129> going<00:03:46.370> around<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.849> bar<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.329> you're

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
blade is going around the bar and you're

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.750 
blade is going around the bar and you're
oiling<00:03:48.169> it<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.470> gets<00:03:48.650> flung<00:03:49.010> down<00:03:49.250> here<00:03:49.639> and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
oiling it it gets flung down here and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.849 
oiling it it gets flung down here and
probably<00:03:49.879> collects<00:03:50.389> right<00:03:51.169> there<00:03:51.409> right<00:03:51.650> that

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
probably collects right there right that

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.289 
probably collects right there right that
could<00:03:52.010> be<00:03:52.129> yeah<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.459> then<00:03:52.579> drip<00:03:52.819> drip<00:03:53.000> I'm

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
could be yeah and then drip drip I'm

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.509 
could be yeah and then drip drip I'm
gonna<00:03:53.449> put<00:03:53.599> this<00:03:53.720> back<00:03:53.930> on<00:03:54.109> no<00:03:54.260> because<00:03:54.590> nobody

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
gonna put this back on no because nobody

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.259 
gonna put this back on no because nobody
needs<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:55.909> get<00:03:56.030> hurt

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
needs to get hurt

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.439 
needs to get hurt
okay<00:03:57.139> so<00:03:57.199> what<00:03:58.129> about<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.459> battery<00:03:58.790> life<00:03:58.879> you

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
okay so what about the battery life you

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.569 
okay so what about the battery life you
said<00:03:59.629> it<00:03:59.780> was<00:03:59.900> about<00:04:00.229> 15<00:04:00.650> minutes<00:04:00.919> or<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.189> did

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
said it was about 15 minutes or so did

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.009 
said it was about 15 minutes or so did
it<00:04:01.669> live<00:04:01.819> up<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.150> one<00:04:02.299> hour<00:04:02.419> charge<00:04:02.720> time

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
it live up to the one hour charge time

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.849 
it live up to the one hour charge time
it<00:04:03.709> did<00:04:03.949> it<00:04:04.519> charged<00:04:04.819> up<00:04:05.060> in<00:04:05.269> an<00:04:05.629> hour<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.229> the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
it did it charged up in an hour but the

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.580 
it did it charged up in an hour but the
down<00:04:07.069> side<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.329> that<00:04:09.019> it<00:04:09.139> took<00:04:09.319> about

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
down side of that is that it took about

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.849 
down side of that is that it took about
an<00:04:09.859> hour<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.340> 15<00:04:10.699> minutes<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.299> cool<00:04:12.109> down<00:04:12.500> to

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
an hour and 15 minutes to cool down to

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.289 
an hour and 15 minutes to cool down to
the<00:04:12.949> point<00:04:13.189> that<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.459> would<00:04:13.579> start<00:04:13.849> charging

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
the point that it would start charging

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.560 
the point that it would start charging
up<00:04:14.419> so<00:04:14.629> I<00:04:14.659> use<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.530> timed<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.400> okay<00:04:17.150> but<00:04:17.509> I

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
up so I use that I timed it okay but I

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.909 
up so I use that I timed it okay but I
mean<00:04:17.720> does<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:17.930> just<00:04:18.139> sit<00:04:18.320> there<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.530> not

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
mean does it just sit there and not

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.580 
mean does it just sit there and not
charge<00:04:19.389> yeah<00:04:20.389> there's<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.019> there's<00:04:21.440> good

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
charge yeah there's a there's good

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.770 
charge yeah there's a there's good
indicators<00:04:22.039> on<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.789> on<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.240> battery<00:04:23.479> charger

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
indicators on the on the battery charger

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.930 
indicators on the on the battery charger
itself<00:04:24.169> or<00:04:24.349> a<00:04:24.380> talk<00:04:24.680> where<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.310> says<00:04:25.460> there's<00:04:25.880> a

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
itself or a talk where it says there's a

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.580 
itself or a talk where it says there's a
button<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.210> says<00:04:26.300> testing<00:04:26.960> okay<00:04:27.260> I'm<00:04:27.409> that

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
button that says testing okay I'm that

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.029 
button that says testing okay I'm that
light<00:04:27.770> will<00:04:27.979> if<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.120> too<00:04:29.270> hot<00:04:29.450> will<00:04:29.630> blink

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
light will if it's too hot will blink

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.820 
light will if it's too hot will blink
until<00:04:31.039> it<00:04:31.460> cools

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
until it cools

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.320 
until it cools
enough<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.220> charge<00:04:32.460> man<00:04:32.760> sounds<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.180> you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
enough to charge man sounds like you

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.290 
enough to charge man sounds like you
read<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.080> manual<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:34.740> did<00:04:35.010> right<00:04:35.940> it's

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
read the manual I did right it's

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.090 
read the manual I did right it's
something<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.570> be<00:04:36.630> proud<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.870> really<00:04:37.260> okay<00:04:37.950> and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
something to be proud of really okay and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.240 
something to be proud of really okay and
so<00:04:38.430> then<00:04:38.610> what<00:04:39.180> would<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.330> think<00:04:40.250> relatively

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
so then what would you think relatively

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.120 
so then what would you think relatively
short<00:04:41.550> battery<00:04:41.790> life<00:04:42.120> 15<00:04:42.570> minutes<00:04:42.900> or<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.260> a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
short battery life 15 minutes or so a

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.680 
short battery life 15 minutes or so a
lot<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.490> cooldown<00:04:44.970> time<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.480> there<00:04:45.570> any

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
lot of cooldown time is there any

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.760 
lot of cooldown time is there any
recommendation<00:04:46.260> you'd<00:04:46.380> make<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
recommendation you'd make to the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.860 
recommendation you'd make to the
manufacturer<00:04:47.640> or<00:04:47.760> maybe<00:04:47.940> about<00:04:48.120> batteries
