Megan chair method after the fact if you
don't<00:02:08.769> get<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:08.979> all<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.099> way<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.429> size

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
don't get it all the way this size

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.529 
don't get it all the way this size
you're<00:02:09.789> going<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.970> wind<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.209> with<00:02:10.390> some

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
you're going to wind up with some

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.930 
you're going to wind up with some
blotchiness<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:12.069> put<00:02:12.250> on<00:02:12.310> your<00:02:12.370> first<00:02:12.700> coat

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
blotchiness so put on your first coat

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.990 
blotchiness so put on your first coat
there<00:02:13.769> let<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.860> dry<00:02:15.130> for<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.700> little<00:02:15.880> bit

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
there let it dry for just a little bit

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.180 
there let it dry for just a little bit
for<00:02:16.390> speed<00:02:17.290> cig<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.709> video<00:02:17.950> I'm<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.130> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
for speed cig in this video I'm going to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.380 
for speed cig in this video I'm going to
go<00:02:18.280> ahead<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.459> put<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.700> my<00:02:18.790> second<00:02:19.090> coat<00:02:19.209> right

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
go ahead and put on my second coat right

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.069 
go ahead and put on my second coat right
away<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.730> second<00:02:22.090> coat<00:02:22.239> needs<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.569> be<00:02:22.690> very

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
away the second coat needs to be very

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.470 
away the second coat needs to be very
very<00:02:23.170> thick<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.549> lay<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:24.970> much<00:02:25.209> thicker

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
very thick so lay it on much thicker

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.199 
very thick so lay it on much thicker
than<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.780> typically<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.670> very<00:02:27.670> very<00:02:27.910> thick

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
than you typically would very very thick

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.740 
than you typically would very very thick
and<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.920> moving<00:02:30.129> very<00:02:30.340> quickly<00:02:30.599> while<00:02:31.599> it's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
and then moving very quickly while it's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.020 
and then moving very quickly while it's
still<00:02:31.959> wet<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.160> open<00:02:33.430> up<00:02:33.489> your<00:02:33.640> flocking

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
still wet you just open up your flocking

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.170 
still wet you just open up your flocking
make<00:02:34.150> sure<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.390> open<00:02:34.540> up<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:36.180> perforated

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
make sure you open up the perforated

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.670 
make sure you open up the perforated
side<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.660> sprinkle<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.860> lot<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.720> nail<00:02:40.989> now

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
side and sprinkle a lot on that nail now

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.869 
side and sprinkle a lot on that nail now
it<00:02:41.799> helps<00:02:42.010> if<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.280> something<00:02:42.459> laid<00:02:42.700> down

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
it helps if you have something laid down

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.280 
it helps if you have something laid down
to<00:02:43.090> catch<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.450> excess<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:44.019> way<00:02:44.110> you're<00:02:44.260> not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to catch the excess that way you're not

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.589 
to catch the excess that way you're not
being<00:02:44.590> wasteful<00:02:45.099> but<00:02:45.640> sprinkle<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.150> lot<00:02:46.360> when

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
being wasteful but sprinkle a lot when

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.819 
being wasteful but sprinkle a lot when
you<00:02:46.690> think<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:46.989> enough<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:47.709> you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
you think you have enough on there you

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.979 
you think you have enough on there you
probably<00:02:48.069> don't<00:02:48.430> sprinkle<00:02:48.790> some<00:02:49.060> more<00:02:49.269> your

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
probably don't sprinkle some more your

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.160 
probably don't sprinkle some more your
entire<00:02:50.549> tip<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.760> your<00:02:51.940> thumb<00:02:52.000> or<00:02:52.569> finger<00:02:52.600> needs

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
entire tip of your thumb or finger needs

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.309 
entire tip of your thumb or finger needs
to<00:02:53.319> be<00:02:53.440> covered<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.519> flocking<00:02:55.260> now<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
to be covered in the flocking now the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.720 
to be covered in the flocking now the
next<00:02:56.620> step<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.400> tricky<00:02:57.700> part

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
next step and this is the tricky part

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.390 
next step and this is the tricky part
you<00:02:57.970> need<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> press<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.599> into<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.049> nail

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
you need to press it into the nail

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.550 
you need to press it into the nail
without<00:03:00.400> smudging<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.239> powder<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.840> usually<00:03:02.410> do

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
without smudging the powder I usually do

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.490 
without smudging the powder I usually do
outside<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.549> then<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.720> stripe<00:03:05.019> right<00:03:05.170> down<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
outside and then a stripe right down the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.280 
outside and then a stripe right down the
middle<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:06.120> get<00:03:07.120> as<00:03:07.239> much<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.630> flunking

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
middle to get as much of that flunking

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.410 
middle to get as much of that flunking
pressed<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.769> there<00:03:08.950> as<00:03:09.040> possible<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.760> usually

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
pressed in there as possible I usually

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.750 
pressed in there as possible I usually
do<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.569> about<00:03:10.840> twice<00:03:11.310> make<00:03:12.310> sure<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.639> get

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
do that about twice make sure you get

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.069 
do that about twice make sure you get
the<00:03:12.880> side<00:03:13.060> your<00:03:13.269> nails<00:03:13.419> so<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:13.690> don't<00:03:13.840> end<00:03:13.930> up

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
the side your nails so you don't end up

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.120 
the side your nails so you don't end up
with<00:03:14.230> any<00:03:14.349> bald<00:03:14.620> spots<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.970> tip<00:03:16.180> as<00:03:16.359> well

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
with any bald spots and the tip as well

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.020 
with any bald spots and the tip as well
now<00:03:18.130> sometimes<00:03:18.340> if<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:18.669> notice<00:03:18.910> yourself

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
now sometimes if you notice yourself

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.520 
now sometimes if you notice yourself
pressing<00:03:19.599> too<00:03:19.810> hard<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.200> press<00:03:20.349> all<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
pressing too hard and you press all the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.589 
pressing too hard and you press all the
way<00:03:20.620> down<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.980> powder<00:03:21.299> excuse<00:03:22.299> me<00:03:22.389> down<00:03:22.510> to
