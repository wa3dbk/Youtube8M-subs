00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
let me show you guys the wire right here

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.360 
let me show you guys the wire right here
these<00:02:35.680> are<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.489> coil<00:02:36.849> wired<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.370> long

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
these are it's a coil wired so it's long

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.699 
these are it's a coil wired so it's long
but<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.180> make<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.450> even<00:02:40.629> longer<00:02:40.840> because

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
but you can make it even longer because

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.589 
but you can make it even longer because
it's<00:02:42.040> coiled<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.329> this<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.510> really

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
it's coiled and I think this is really

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.599 
it's coiled and I think this is really
nice<00:02:44.019> because<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.440> really<00:02:44.560> compact<00:02:45.129> as<00:02:45.400> well

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
nice because it's really compact as well

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.710 
nice because it's really compact as well
and<00:02:46.680> both<00:02:47.680> sides<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.670> heads<00:02:49.090> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
and both sides of the heads that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.589 
and both sides of the heads that
connected<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> your<00:02:51.069> iPod<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.420> the

connected to your iPod and to the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.990 
connected to your iPod and to the
headphones<00:02:52.959> are<00:02:53.470> gold-plated<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.879> that's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
headphones are gold-plated so that's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.780 
headphones are gold-plated so that's
really<00:02:55.269> nice<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.430> one<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.579> greatest

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
really nice and one of the greatest

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
really nice and one of the greatest
thing<00:02:58.030> about<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.389> is<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.720> most<00:02:59.409> headphones

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
thing about is is that most headphones

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
thing about is is that most headphones
they<00:03:00.220> have<00:03:00.370> detachable<00:03:00.790> cords<00:03:01.389> like<00:03:01.690> these

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
they have detachable cords like these

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.399 
they have detachable cords like these
high-end<00:03:02.799> ones<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:04.540> sets<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.989> aside

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
high-end ones and what sets this aside

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.050 
high-end ones and what sets this aside
from<00:03:05.560> other<00:03:05.829> ones<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.459> when<00:03:06.639> you<00:03:06.790> put

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
from other ones is that when you put

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.080 
from other ones is that when you put
this<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.290> can<00:03:08.530> actually<00:03:08.829> lock<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.579> in<00:03:09.730> so

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
this in you can actually lock it in so

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.930 
this in you can actually lock it in so
you<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.450> place<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.500> there<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:12.579> turn

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.819 
you just place it in there and you turn
it<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.299> it's<00:03:13.480> totally<00:03:13.840> luck<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.530> will<00:03:14.650> not

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.470 
good for its price it's 80 bucks on
amazon<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:39.629> again<00:03:40.629> as<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.870> said<00:03:41.069> these<00:03:42.480> cords

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
amazon and again as I said these cords

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.750 
amazon and again as I said these cords
are<00:03:43.599> detachable<00:03:44.199> so<00:03:44.470> if<00:03:44.650> these<00:03:44.859> break<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.430> your

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
are detachable so if these break or your

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.030 
are detachable so if these break or your
headphones<00:03:46.239> break<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.690> can<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.739> ebay<00:03:48.010> I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
headphones break you can go on ebay I

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.640 
headphones break you can go on ebay I
guess<00:03:48.280> by<00:03:48.489> new<00:03:48.699> headphones<00:03:49.180> or<00:03:49.419> if<00:03:50.079> your<00:03:50.290> wire

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
guess by new headphones or if your wire

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.280 
guess by new headphones or if your wire
breaks<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.459> buy<00:03:51.699> replaceable<00:03:52.599> wire<00:03:52.959> and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
breaks you can buy replaceable wire and

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.680 
breaks you can buy replaceable wire and
they<00:03:53.739> also<00:03:53.859> have<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.549> wires<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.329> aren't

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
they also have the wires that aren't

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.170 
they also have the wires that aren't
coiled<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.859> an<00:03:57.010> option<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.459> both<00:03:57.669> but

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
coiled so you have an option of both but

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.670 
coiled so you have an option of both but
when<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.419> buy<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.629> comes<00:03:59.109> with<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.290> coiled

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
when you buy it comes with the coiled

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.589 
when you buy it comes with the coiled
ones<00:03:59.859> few<00:04:00.669> other<00:04:00.879> things<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.329> liked<00:04:01.540> about
