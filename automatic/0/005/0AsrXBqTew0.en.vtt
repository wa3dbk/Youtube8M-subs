00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 today I want to show you how to do 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.480
 paper tape pattern which 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:16.560
 can be used as a pen 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.609
 baskets and how to take a wicker letter 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 fold in half take another 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 tubule 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.179
 for him we also enclose one 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 this part is wrapped and here is such 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.350
 small loop to be seen on 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:42.890
 we get this one on the bottom and bring it here 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.890
 this loop 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.700
 and neatly tighten it all take 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.820
 this little straw 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.390
 skip it between these two 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.140
 brown two 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.500
 and we take this tube 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 we put on top 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:17.300
 and enter here and tighten 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 it turns out mustache 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.909
 next we take this tubule 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.730
 we put on top 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.690
 so here 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.690
 I will not forget this one over this pipe 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.060
 at the bottom of this, I now PM 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:53.950
 take out and gently tighten further 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.950
 take this duct skip between 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 in two 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:15.100
 we drop it up and pour it into this 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:20.459
 pull the eyelet out and tighten it then 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.459
 we take all that side we put on top 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.670
 put the tube on top of greens 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.010
 we lower on a bottom we pass through hot 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.700
 tubules and in this loop 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.700
 we derive 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.890
 and so we can continue with this 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.970
 sides we omit there between two 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.970
 Alko we get 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.050
 we put this on top and skip it from behind 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.140
 this cart 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.140
 So 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.900
 this tube we put on top is we 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.170
 drop down 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.170
 we get back and here again. 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.769
 and neat penkin 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.600
 we get such a particular day for 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:34.020
 tubules and continue 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.860
 Here is such a tape it turned out a little 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.710
 uneven 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 but then she is the glue is applied on 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.360
 whom 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.160
 and even out try it with such 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.160
 get all the luck
