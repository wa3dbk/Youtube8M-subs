well but as I'm here this is how you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
well but as I'm here this is how you
make<00:00:33.300> science<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> second<00:00:34.260> line<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:35.100> just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
make science on the second line you just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.990 
make science on the second line you just
typed<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.239> name<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.200> character<00:00:38.100> so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
typed the name of the character so

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.569 
typed the name of the character so
they're<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.890> bucket<00:00:40.890> page<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.250> spigot

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
they're all on the bucket page or spigot

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.270 
they're all on the bucket page or spigot
page<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.940> think<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.750> both

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
page I think you can get it from both

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.770 
page I think you can get it from both
but<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> second<00:00:45.300> line<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
but it's got to be on the second line so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.500 
but it's got to be on the second line so
if<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.070> won't<00:00:47.219> work<00:00:47.510> but

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
if you don't do that it won't work but

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
if you don't do that it won't work but
what<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.079> want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.440> first<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.270> create<00:00:51.800> the
