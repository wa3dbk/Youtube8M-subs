00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.340
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.010
 shown how to easily windows 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.900
 applications also under ubuntu or under 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.340
 linux can start 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.340
 I will demonstrate this here 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.320
 with read fix version 8 1 spectator 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.669
 asked us to that extent so far 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.930
 exactly this program 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.570
 Of course, each one still works 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.689
 amount of other programs look in the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.059
 description wake york there you will find 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.180
 several listings which programs 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.739
 because, for example, the top25 run the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.080
 I've already called this is supposed to 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.160
 then apparently almost all the games 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.260
 top 25 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.370
 but as I said there is still 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.200
 lots more 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.760
 okay you do not see that much now 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.350
 via my database must retrieve here 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.079
 After developer you can then 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.999
 fight accordingly hereby 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.100
 most absolutely works without 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.870
 problems as well as now you read my 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.649
 fix but we start by doing so 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.670
 first install the wine software 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.869
 I start this first 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.869
 optics package management 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.299
 Enter password 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.980
 looking here 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.340
 then choose 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.290
 then we will see a lot more 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.970
 additionally installed click on 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.970
 Apply 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.130
 it takes a moment now 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.439
 Microsoft 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.399
 start we have to confirm then 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.399
 the whole thing goes on 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 now has become 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.790
 the icon of our reader fix eight here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.170
 changed 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.210
 Colorful is now able to handle problems 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.790
 also to display the icon before because 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.420
 a standard icon for excel files well 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.310
 you can close this here 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
 that here too and now we are in the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.540
 position right mouse button and there we have 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.110
 here with wine windows program starter 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.110
 to open 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.519
 we know that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.519
 in our windows-desktop setup 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.450
 so 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.450
 accept walter 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.700
 click that 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 but so through 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.990
 That's it 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.000
 we can drive 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.380
 click a few now 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.560
 There are no difficulties here 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.370
 finished child we still close something he 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.840
 has some difficulties now 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 gets namely the temporary files 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.070
 he does not get deleted anymore 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.800
 but this is relatively unimportant us can 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.670
 even by hand 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.170
 because joins right now already 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 himself 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.130
 only takes a moment so that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 quite the program started like 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.530
 we get our tooltips okay like that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.390
 Now we have the bird I doubt 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.400
 now that's synonymous with windows 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.080
 Looks like I guess what's here 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 now turquoise in this case 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.230
 will probably be under windows 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.090
 transparent but good with it we can 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.130
 that's how it works otherwise 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.040
 program quite easily if I 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.030
 mark that here now 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.030
 and let go 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.950
 when he is still working here 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.830
 who now 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.810
 read aloud and that what I here 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.730
 have marked that is the content of this 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.810
 software 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.410
 I'm just waiting here until now 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.820
 what to hear but now reads 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.200
 so that we also see them before you 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.790
 in the text and I get it too 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.860
 Of course, they hear that over headphones 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.930
 does not show that the whole problem 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.010
 that works who rest is program 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.810
 specifically i can speak a different language 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.070
 Select has English and so on 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.720
 but nothing to do with wine 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.080
 So it works absolutely without problems 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.459
 also sound and her video with the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.109
 assumption that this also under 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:25.480
 Windows is not quite like that 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.480
 So it's okay
