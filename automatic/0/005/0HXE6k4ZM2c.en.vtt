00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.340
 I'm feeling this surprisingly box 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.090
 parts 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.090
 How many 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.920
 What is work hard, which has posted a Gundam production videos 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.620
 Big 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.530
 Model of making 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.930
 There is a lot but I will 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.390
 I have been bought 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 rtx 65 bullet tank 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.590
 Early Type Mobile Suit Gundam 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.370
 This is the initial of cancer tank that came out to Jiorijin 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 It is good that I bought this, but clearly 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.850
 Watch the box 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.579
 A little 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.750
 Same 1/144 voice 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.760
 Here 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.760
 Char's dedicated Zak- Dioridine version 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.770
 By comparison, this front song is together but 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.700
 There was height 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.700
 Clearly different 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.579
 Quite different 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.120
 What is 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.310
 There should be a lot of parts simply 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.040
 No, I this 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.000
 Overwintering in a giant rock tank 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.270
 And is not it like this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.170
 The colors of the parts are not all that much 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.869
 It also forms I 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.930
 Well these are a little sketchy person is gone or so if there are parts of the multi-leg joints 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.810
 Than does not mean that if there 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.270
 Kedomo I thought that Na whether quite make Innovation crispy 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 Hmmm 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.620
 Look at the side of this past 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.060
 I want you to Tsu Anbaka 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.060
 For now I would like to open it because I can not help but say various things without looking inside 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.470
 It has entered Chile Mitch Jii' 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 It is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.650
 There Yes 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.340
 The number of parts may not be so much 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.599
 Ummm 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.350
 The harp is big and it 's different from that 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:26.100
 So it is a little might be whether the box was also increased 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.620
 This little park or something 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.560
 But Oh 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.560
 Big pants 2 also decided pants 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.290
 The box may have been a bit bigger because of that 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.990
 I opened the contents and took out a part 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.360
 so 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:50.990
 The part of the cho body is here It is a gray part of this color 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.340
 And I think that this side is part of the waist 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.500
 It is a very big par 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.720
 This is finished in pretty good feeling even just to put ink in the are also turned off firmly mold 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.750
 Are n't you sure? 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.220
 Here located in the parts of the joint portion of the arm, such as those covered by the high-cloth representation as a representation 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.670
 Will be a party 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.310
 It feels like this, I guess you can express something pretty clothy 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.170
 Well Well that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.880
 It might be better than Thunderbolt version 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:26.410
 Also here is a part of the body part, but par 2 of various accessories 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:31.810
 It looks like the part I want to sell it does here 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.920
 I think that one place where everyone track of parts is anxious fine if you have made it like this 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.090
 It is- 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.379
 Finance is usually of plastic Well that I'm not Toka rubber 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.950
 It looks like this is a body and parts similar to him 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:50.270
 The design of the marking seal is like this 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:56.300
 The color of parts is also less 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:59.760
 Even though I was not enclose the Do a little hawk or assembled reasonably easy 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.220
 I'm unexpectedly designed firmly 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.750
 this is 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.640
 Just put in the mirror 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.250
 I feel that the feeling is likely to be a tough feeling Above all the parts are big and also 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.260
 A little 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.100
 It was a bit surprising that the box was big 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:26.810
 I mean Ademo this is usually that or scale model 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.650
 If you are making a knitting between stopping Toka aerospace bar is not it make cool really and make a hole 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.030
 Isn't it 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.050
 The base case is more like a model than a gunpla. 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.050
 Than there is air 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.430
 8 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.460
 If this also sticks 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.380
 It does not may surely take time 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.380
 I would like to go home or not 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.539
 Hm 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.509
 I Hey Let's doing to hear only this 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:03.219
 I also without at all Toka gate tried a little Tashi heard only part of Imari Thailand 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.219
 Although the key is only 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.670
 It is better 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.770
 It feels like you're wondering what to do with it 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.770
 The parts are like this 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:37.810
 The boob is so sunny and sunny 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.680
 If it's not easy, I wo n't come up with a case that touches on these mimicry parts 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.480
 me 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.450
 Is whether the thing 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.450
 If you think that one by one this kind of painting 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:54.350
 It feels pretty creepy 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.910
 Notebook As for my schedule, this area is old and spray is small as usual 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.350
 Say I went to say painted Gochatto in Weathering Master 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.740
 I'm thinking about things 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.740
 Tethering is always always this wind set 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.330
 I'm using a metallic f set 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.760
 This track part and this time 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.960
 It is a weathering master of another color 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:22.350
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:25.110
 I think there are a lot of d sets and a more sets, so this side and this side also usually 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.910
 I do not use it at all in Gunpla 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:35.300
 I think if you use this time 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:37.370
 It is what Te that dot that has been despised a little It is from a little overall image but peach 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.820
 Quite 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.430
 This time is over but it seems to take time 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.660
 What 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:52.630
 kidd Well I do not know unless Dodo is going back and starts making 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:55.750
 In the mean time, I can not give you a part of it, but it is overwintering 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:07:02.540
 All parts of this side towards the homepage 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:04.580
 I think it's economic phase by taking a picture, so please check it there too 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.370
 By say 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:14.810
 Of Mobile Suit Gundam salt lysine version 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.810
 Gun tank early type I think that I want to produce again in the future
