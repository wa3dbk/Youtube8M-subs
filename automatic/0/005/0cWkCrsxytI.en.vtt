00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.150
 I am always Artyom and in this video we'll talk 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.570
 with you about health hard drives hard 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 the disk as you know has electronic and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
 mechanical part ie rotating 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.010
 a disk and accordingly everything that has 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.930
 some mechanical parts have such 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.390
 property break well electronics of course 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.580
 but mechanics breaks down and even more so 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 says how do we understand and track how 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.680
 says our state of health 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 drive for this we will use 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 applet magic applet under 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.149
 called this utility even I would 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.320
 say and sit life pro version given 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.610
 the moment is 40 193 in every modern 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.600
 hard drive 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.379
 embedded technology called smart 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:59.430
 This technology allows you to track 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.039
 some kind of disk error condition 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 the state of its various attributes and so 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.189
 further mainly mechanics technology 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 appeared a long time ago at ninety 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.710
 the fifth year with the participation of both seagate there 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.560
 western digital and so on for such 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.560
 major giants and in principle from 95 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.549
 everywhere there is this technology she was 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.909
 several versions and in all modern 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.790
 Disks it is download the program 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.950
 run the program cost 300 rubles I 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.979
 I think this is a meager fee just for 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.439
 what it gives you in the end all 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.259
 disk health information 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.180
 if accordingly you do not pay here at 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.979
 I have already several CDs that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.430
 information will be displayed only about 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.040
 one of them that is the free version in 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.100
 principle also workable here with us 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 drive model is displayed 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.060
 brand name farther in size and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.930
 temperature temperature is very interesting 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.390
 here we have such a risk 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.910
 the poet should not allow headquarters drive 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.890
 we overheated 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.599
 the critical temperature is already considered 60 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.050
 degrees forty four i have everything in 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.090
 okay 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.670
 below here we have a very interesting such 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.090
 the attribute how much the disk has worked for us 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.110
 me it's two years 17 days 23 hours either 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.430
 17 thousand nine hundred fifty one hours 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.800
 there is how much we have drive 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.930
 this attribute works interesting by the way 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.090
 leave in the comments to this video 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 how much does your drive work 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.270
 the oldest in the computer will just be 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.790
 interesting to know 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.260
 next is health here 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.850
 7 and 7 percent is all well and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.210
 manufacturer performance 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.980
 apologizing ex tapes i mean everything is good 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.170
 below we can see the attributes of smart 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.680
 now tell you what it is here with us 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.110
 benefits all in Russian completely 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.910
 click for example on the error rate and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.070
 Help displays the frequency of occurrence 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.050
 errors when reading a disk, what it is 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.400
 and immediately we are told that more 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.680
 the number of errors that is less 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.110
 the value of this attribute is bad 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.440
 I have a disk surface condition 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.030
 55 percent is still good in principle 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.850
 Here we can 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.209
 to predict 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.720
 soon for example a quick breakdown 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.000
 our drive and take some measures well 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.610
 In general, in any case, I recommend you 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.500
 back up regularly 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.600
 your most important data so they 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.280
 It turned out such a situation that the disk suddenly 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.760
 refused and the data is not available if 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.470
 they are very important you have some 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.750
 how to restore them and so on 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.709
 it's all quite expensive so it's easier 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.270
 and cheaper to do regular do 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.890
 backups and now 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.630
 software allows you to do 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.880
 it's all a bunch of automatic 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.140
 various programs both free and 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.850
 toll so do not be lazy and 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.340
 set yourself one of the programs which 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.380
 makes backups and will be in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.360
 security what was artem with you 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.450
 subscribe to the channel put your finger 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.450
 up leave comments and bye bye
