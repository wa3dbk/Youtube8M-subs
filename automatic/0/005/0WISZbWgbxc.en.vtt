00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 it's a sad sight 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.690
 unfortunately running romania to the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.189
 city ​​as in the countryside 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 stray dogs with stigmas 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.139
 abuse are everywhere you 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.619
 many of you indignant about the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.029
 situation of these animals in this country 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.170
 today the Romanian authorities have 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.510
 makes new laws vote 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 particularly severe to stem the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 proliferation of these dogs that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.970
 now have no chance of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.769
 survival except those who will have the chance to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 cross nina a young veterinarian 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
 German she has already made many 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.460
 stays in romania thanks to support 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 of a German organization is 30 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.300
 million friends she's going to run a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.430
 sterilization campaign that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.690
 will run here at the suceava refuge 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.340
 many mayors consider 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 that stray dogs constitutes a 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.719
 danger to the population 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.629
 that's why he catches them then the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.430
 locks up in decrepit shelters the law 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.050
 allows to euthanize them if they have 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.050
 not adopted after two weeks 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.710
 but what he forgets too often is 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.960
 that most of these dogs have been 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.340
 castrated by nina and her colleagues and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.260
 that they have made themselves a place in the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.140
 street and in the hearts of people and are 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.850
 in no way aggressive I have horribly 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.220
 shame when I see the tenderness cases these 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.930
 dogs tell us they are opening up to 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.610
 we and does not stop thanking us 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.830
 while what they were subjected to is 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.930
 really awful I think that as 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.460
 that being human we should not 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100
 forget that we have them 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.140
 rendered dependent they have terribly 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.110
 need us and they continue to have 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.680
 blindly trust in us this 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.560
 trust 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.800
 we should never abuse it 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.450
 very very important 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.250
 a week ago these four puppies have 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.830
 been abandoned in front of the refuge in a 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.170
 cardboard box and that unfortunately it 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.759
 happens more and more often people 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.380
 find it normal to get rid 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 so puppies they do not want 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.100
 the problem is that these little ones 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.960
 have very little chance of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.680
 survive in a shelter such as this 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.240
 this is why we are deploying 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.740
 a lot of effort to sterilize 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.330
 new puppies that are born in this 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.540
 country he just does not want 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.540
 two
