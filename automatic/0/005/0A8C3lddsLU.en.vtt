is<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.750> does<00:03:42.380> debate<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:44.209> has<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.480> be

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
is that does debate and it has to be

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.259 
is that does debate and it has to be
done<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.440> chunks<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.549> have<00:03:46.579> actual

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
done in chunks so that we have actual

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.770 
done in chunks so that we have actual
results<00:03:47.840> are<00:03:47.959> not<00:03:48.110> just<00:03:48.470> ongoing<00:03:48.920> debate<00:03:49.780> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
results are not just ongoing debate it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.949
