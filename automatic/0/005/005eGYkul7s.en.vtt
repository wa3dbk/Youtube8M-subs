00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
want to get some oil

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.580 
want to get some oil
it<00:00:16.080> takes<00:00:16.410> three<00:00:16.949> oil<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.490> five<00:00:17.850> hide<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:19.560> make

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it takes three oil and five hide to make

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.089 
it takes three oil and five hide to make
five<00:00:20.010> five<00:00:20.900> gasoline<00:00:23.390> this<00:00:24.390> thingy<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.289> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
five five gasoline this thingy and you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.929 
five five gasoline this thingy and you
use<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> fuel<00:00:26.910> your<00:00:27.150> fabricator<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.080> your

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
use it to fuel your fabricator in your

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
use it to fuel your fabricator in your
generator<00:00:30.349> when<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.189> you

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
generator when you get that and then you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.690 
generator when you get that and then you
use<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.759> advanced<00:00:33.120> crafting<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:33.840> well<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
use it for advanced crafting as well of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.580 
use it for advanced crafting as well of
course<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> maintain<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.230> machines

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
course so you can maintain your machines

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
course so you can maintain your machines
I'm<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:40.950> sure<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.790> high

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
I'm pretty sure you know how to get high

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
I'm pretty sure you know how to get high
just<00:00:42.420> kill<00:00:42.660> animals<00:00:43.219> dinosaurs<00:00:44.930> oil<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
just kill animals dinosaurs oil is a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
just kill animals dinosaurs oil is a
little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.860> harder<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.059> find<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
little bit harder to get you can find it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.459 
little bit harder to get you can find it
under<00:00:48.629> water<00:00:50.570> yeah<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.870> five

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
under water yeah here we go five

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
under water yeah here we go five
gasoline<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.320> find<00:00:56.059> find<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.390> oil<00:00:57.690> on

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
gasoline you can find find the oil on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.910 
gasoline you can find find the oil on
the<00:00:57.930> water<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:59.010> ores<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.910> you'll<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.510> oil

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
the water in in ores and you'll see oil

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
the water in in ores and you'll see oil
floating<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.579> towards<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> surface

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
floating from the on towards the surface

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
floating from the on towards the surface
in<00:01:04.670> yeah<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.360> long<00:01:07.070> stream<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.640> they're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
in yeah in like a long stream so they're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
in yeah in like a long stream so they're
pretty<00:01:11.790> easy<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> locate<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.930> you're

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
pretty easy to locate when you're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
pretty easy to locate when you're
already<00:01:13.200> underwater<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> would

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
already underwater but I would

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.789 
already underwater but I would
definitely<00:01:15.240> suggest<00:01:15.780> taming<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.979> Megalodon<00:01:17.640> or

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
definitely suggest taming a Megalodon or

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.760 
definitely suggest taming a Megalodon or
something<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:21.110> my<00:01:22.110> hurt<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.560> are

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
something like that my hurt they are

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.880 
something like that my hurt they are
adding<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.369> new<00:01:23.610> water<00:01:24.180> dinosaurs<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.740> week

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
adding two new water dinosaurs this week

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.819 
adding two new water dinosaurs this week
which<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.040> guess<00:01:29.280> also<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.090> used<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.829> for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
which I guess also can be used for for

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.410 
which I guess also can be used for for
diving<00:01:32.220> around<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.729> otherwise<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.390> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
diving around but otherwise you can just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.830 
diving around but otherwise you can just
level<00:01:33.840> your<00:01:33.900> oxygen<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.610> find<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> recipe<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
level your oxygen or find the recipe so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.270 
level your oxygen or find the recipe so
if<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> special<00:01:38.130> food<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:40.280> make

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
if there's a special food that make

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.780 
if there's a special food that make
makes<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.150> oxygen<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.369> slower

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
makes your oxygen like go way slower

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.920 
makes your oxygen like go way slower
than<00:01:45.030> usual<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.930> that's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
than usual then you do so that's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.499 
than usual then you do so that's
actually<00:01:49.320> how<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.479> gasoline<00:01:53.149> oil<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
actually how you get gasoline oil is the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
actually how you get gasoline oil is the
hard<00:01:54.720> part<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:56.700> places<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> close

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
hard part but some places it's so close

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.280 
hard part but some places it's so close
to<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.520> beach<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.750> actually<00:02:00.930> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to the beach that you can actually just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
to the beach that you can actually just
swing<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.240> mine<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
swing down and and mine it just to get a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.910 
swing down and and mine it just to get a
few<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:06.149> island<00:02:07.250> northeast<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> map

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
few on the island northeast and the map

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.190 
few on the island northeast and the map
like<00:02:10.920> right<00:02:11.370> here

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
like right here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
like right here
you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.810> find<00:02:18.989> one<00:02:19.440> or<00:02:19.830> two

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you can you can you can find one or two

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
you can you can you can find one or two
like<00:02:20.580> really<00:02:21.150> close<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> edge<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
like really close to the edge where you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.690 
like really close to the edge where you
can<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:23.099> just<00:02:23.129> fly<00:02:23.610> fly<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.599> island<00:02:25.700> just

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
can you just fly fly to the island just

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.240 
can you just fly fly to the island just
swim<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.360> mine<00:02:28.200> that's<00:02:28.500> what<00:02:28.739> we<00:02:28.890> did

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
swim out and mine that's what we did

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.550 
swim out and mine that's what we did
a<00:02:29.280> couple<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.849> times<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.599> get<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.930> thing

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
a couple of times just to get this thing

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.880 
a couple of times just to get this thing
running<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:34.019> that's<00:02:34.709> basically<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> guys

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
running so that's basically it guys

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.390 
running so that's basically it guys
pretty<00:02:37.890> easy<00:02:38.099> but<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.849> again<00:02:39.150> pretty<00:02:39.750> hard

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
pretty easy but then again pretty hard

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.229
