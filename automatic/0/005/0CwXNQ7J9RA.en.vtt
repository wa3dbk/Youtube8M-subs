hi<00:00:01.380> folks<00:00:01.650> it's<00:00:02.399> me<00:00:02.730> again<00:00:04.940> so<00:00:05.940> I'm<00:00:06.720> now<00:00:06.990> going

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
hi folks it's me again so I'm now going

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.490 
hi folks it's me again so I'm now going
to<00:00:07.350> be<00:00:07.470> testing<00:00:08.960> SSD<00:00:10.910> sort<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> speeds<00:00:12.440> on<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
to be testing SSD sort of speeds on the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589 
to be testing SSD sort of speeds on the
Thunderbolt<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.120> give<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> good

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
Thunderbolt so you can see give a good

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.810 
Thunderbolt so you can see give a good
idea<00:00:15.929> now<00:00:16.400> on<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> black<00:00:17.699> magic<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.900> selected

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
idea now on the black magic are selected

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.820 
idea now on the black magic are selected
this<00:00:20.820> drive<00:00:21.320> which<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:23.449> kingston<00:00:24.680> 120<00:00:25.680> gig

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this drive which is a kingston 120 gig

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.040 
this drive which is a kingston 120 gig
SSD<00:00:26.599> ssdnow<00:00:27.800> 200<00:00:28.800> v<00:00:29.369> plus<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.779> don't<00:00:30.960> be

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
SSD ssdnow 200 v plus so we don't be

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
SSD ssdnow 200 v plus so we don't be
some<00:00:31.260> Thunderbolt<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
some Thunderbolt so we're going to do a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.730 
some Thunderbolt so we're going to do a
quick<00:00:32.910> test<00:00:33.469> here<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.530> go

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.470 

as<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.720> high

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
as you can see it's a pretty high

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.960 
as you can see it's a pretty high
reaching<00:00:45.480> speeds<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:48.350> 145<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.770> read<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.730> about

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
reaching speeds of 145 and read is about

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.310 
reaching speeds of 145 and read is about
200<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.990> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.890> good<00:00:53.870> you're<00:00:54.870> using

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
200 and this is pretty good you're using

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.720 
200 and this is pretty good you're using
it<00:00:55.560> for<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.800> sort<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.840> under<00:00:57.840> three<00:00:58.080> weeks

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
it for about sort of under three weeks

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.030 
it for about sort of under three weeks
so<00:00:59.730> yeah<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> mean<00:01:00.240> it's<00:01:00.420> an<00:01:00.570> empty<00:01:00.720> dry<00:01:01.080> but

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
so yeah I mean it's an empty dry but

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.390 
so yeah I mean it's an empty dry but
it's<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.490> bad<00:01:02.700> so<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.360> do<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:05.220> know<00:01:05.340> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it's not bad so I can do you know it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800 
it's not bad so I can do you know it
would<00:01:05.490> be<00:01:05.520> good<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:05.820> video<00:01:06.240> work<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> all

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
would be good for video work and all

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.730 
would be good for video work and all
that<00:01:06.960> sort<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> thing<00:01:07.370> now<00:01:08.840> anyways<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that sort of thing now anyways that's a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.880 
that sort of thing now anyways that's a
test<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.300> it<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.870> connected<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.620> Oh

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
test now I have it here connected to Oh

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.060 
test now I have it here connected to Oh
Sees<00:01:14.160> add<00:01:14.370> agility<00:01:14.610> 3<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.200> we're<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:16.800> going<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
Sees add agility 3 so we're now going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.880 
Sees add agility 3 so we're now going to
do<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.550> clone<00:01:18.090> test<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.260> first<00:01:19.440> drive<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
do a clone test so the first drive is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.870 
do a clone test so the first drive is
the<00:01:21.110> old<00:01:22.110> c's<00:01:22.380> ad<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.100> second<00:01:23.430> drive<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the old c's ad and the second drive is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.020 
the old c's ad and the second drive is
the<00:01:24.500> instant<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> shot

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.780 

this<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.170> how<00:01:33.500> fast<00:01:33.860> Thunderbolt<00:01:34.790> is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.720 

on<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.450> system

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
on the system

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.020 
on the system
as<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.780> see

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
as you can see

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.340 
as you can see
it's<00:01:43.630> covered<00:01:43.900> over<00:01:44.140> almost<00:01:44.440> 500<00:01:45.250> Meg<00:01:45.460> in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's covered over almost 500 Meg in

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.550 
it's covered over almost 500 Meg in
under<00:01:47.350> 8<00:01:47.530> 17<00:01:48.490> 18<00:01:48.820> seconds<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.640> about<00:01:52.560> according

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
under 8 17 18 seconds is about according

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.260 
under 8 17 18 seconds is about according
to<00:01:53.590> my<00:01:53.770> calculations<00:01:53.799> is<00:01:54.460> about<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.909> gig<00:01:55.150> in

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
to my calculations is about a gig in

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.249 
to my calculations is about a gig in
minute<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.450> copy<00:01:58.630> speed<00:01:59.020> and

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
minute so that's your copy speed and

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.600 
minute so that's your copy speed and
that's<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.710> benefit<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.159> using<00:02:00.840> Thunderbolt

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that's the benefit of using Thunderbolt

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.360 
that's the benefit of using Thunderbolt
setups

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
setups

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.460 
setups
there<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.940> go

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.530 

you
