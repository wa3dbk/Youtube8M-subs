00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020 
here and you're outside of the map now
you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.990> anything<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you can do anything from here but you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
you can do anything from here but you
say<00:01:12.270> again<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:13.080> jump<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> train<00:01:14.280> tracks

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
say again don't jump on the train tracks

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.779 
say again don't jump on the train tracks
because<00:01:15.090> i<00:01:15.479> did<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.990> ended<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.680> falling<00:01:17.340> now

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
because i did and ended up falling now

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.270 
because i did and ended up falling now
this<00:01:18.659> only<00:01:18.960> works<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:21.350> EXO<00:01:22.350> survival<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this only works on EXO survival just

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.209 
this only works on EXO survival just
because<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.390> more<00:01:25.140> hover<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.740> EXO

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
because you will have more hover in EXO

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.420 
because you will have more hover in EXO
survival<00:01:26.399> so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.259> maybe<00:01:28.530> try<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.009> online

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
survival so you can maybe try it online

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
survival so you can maybe try it online
but<00:01:30.000> i<00:01:30.270> don't<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.380> work<00:01:31.439> because

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
but i don't think it will work because

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
but i don't think it will work because
you<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.930> less<00:01:33.930> hover<00:01:34.920> ability<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:36.240> there

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you have less hover ability right there

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.389 
you have less hover ability right there
