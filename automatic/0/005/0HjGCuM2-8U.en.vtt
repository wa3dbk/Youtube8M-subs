00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
perfectly also my other tip is to leave

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.069 
perfectly also my other tip is to leave
a<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:05.340> amount<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.790> space<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.299> between<00:02:06.329> your

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
a good amount of space in between your

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.219 
a good amount of space in between your
subject<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.860> backdrop<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
subject and your backdrop so that you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.300 
subject and your backdrop so that you
don't<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.500> any

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
don't get any

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.150 
don't get any
