gas vapor smell and you do we've had the
trunk<00:00:20.430> open<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.910> couple<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.150> weeks<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
trunk open for a couple of weeks now and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.179 
trunk open for a couple of weeks now and
you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.140> still<00:00:22.410> smell<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> regular

you can still smell it on a regular

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.359 
you can still smell it on a regular
basis<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.500> what<00:00:25.500> we're<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> do<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
basis so what we're going to do first is

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
basis so what we're going to do first is
fold<00:00:26.640> down<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> panel<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.349> give<00:00:28.470> you

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
fold down this panel now they give you

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
fold down this panel now they give you
access<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.599> recirculation<00:00:30.599> system

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
access to all the recirculation system

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
access to all the recirculation system
we've<00:00:31.199> got<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.759> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.969> one-way<00:00:33.360> valve

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
we've got here this is a one-way valve

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.560 
we've got here this is a one-way valve
and<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> best<00:00:34.590> way<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> check<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.480> used<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and the best way to check is used to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
and the best way to check is used to
blow<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:37.050> black<00:00:37.350> hand<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> should<00:00:38.460> be

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
blow into black hand and you should be

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.920 
blow into black hand and you should be
able<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> blow<00:00:38.879> into<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> when<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.719> pull

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
able to blow into it and when you pull

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.200 
able to blow into it and when you pull
it<00:00:40.050> off<00:00:40.170> blowing<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> yellow<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.059> you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
it off blowing the yellow in and you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.639 
it off blowing the yellow in and you
should<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.540> move<00:00:42.750> along<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.290> makes<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
should not move along and that makes it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.450 
should not move along and that makes it
a<00:00:43.770> one-way<00:00:44.070> valve

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a one-way valve

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.220 
a one-way valve
I'm<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> remove<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.780> lay<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I'm just going to remove this and lay it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.389 
I'm just going to remove this and lay it
out<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> trunk<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
out of the trunk so you can see it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:01:08.600 
out of the trunk so you can see it
better<00:01:05.780> see<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.070> kind<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.220> wraps<00:01:08.430> around

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
better see how the kind of wraps around

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
better see how the kind of wraps around
the<00:01:08.790> top<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.420> hooks<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.990> plastic<00:01:10.530> -

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the top and any hooks to this plastic -

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.250 
the top and any hooks to this plastic -
that's<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.250> loose<00:01:11.549> fitting<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that's a pretty loose fitting and that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
that's a pretty loose fitting and that
may<00:01:13.470> actually<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.890> where<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.280> issue<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
may actually be where an issue is it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.170 
may actually be where an issue is it
doesn't<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> clamp<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> factory

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
doesn't have a clamp from the factory

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
doesn't have a clamp from the factory
this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> those<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> hooks<00:01:19.020> -<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> see

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
this is those of hooks - as you can see

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.120 
this is those of hooks - as you can see
it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> piece<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.060> hose<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.630> adapter<00:01:22.130> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's a piece of hose and adapter and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
it's a piece of hose and adapter and
then<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.430> got<00:01:23.610> another<00:01:24.330> piece<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.720> hose

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then we got another piece of hose

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
then we got another piece of hose
another<00:01:25.439> one-way<00:01:25.830> valve<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> goes

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
another one-way valve and then it goes

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270 
another one-way valve and then it goes
back<00:01:26.970> down<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.360> gaming<00:01:27.720> back<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
back down to gaming back around then it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
back down to gaming back around then it
goes<00:01:29.369> back<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.670> again<00:01:30.119> why<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.479> stepped<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
goes back up again why they stepped it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
goes back up again why they stepped it
so<00:01:31.020> many<00:01:31.140> times<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:31.829> know<00:01:32.119> we're<00:01:33.119> gonna

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so many times I don't know we're gonna

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
so many times I don't know we're gonna
put<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> back<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.530> was

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
put it back just like the way it was

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859 
put it back just like the way it was
with<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> same<00:01:35.610> doctors<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
with all the same doctors in it but

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
with all the same doctors in it but
we're<00:01:36.990> gonna<00:01:37.079> use<00:01:37.170> silicone<00:01:37.799> hose<00:01:38.040> rather

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
we're gonna use silicone hose rather

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
we're gonna use silicone hose rather
than<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> cloth<00:01:38.909> braided<00:01:39.299> hose<00:01:39.890> then<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> take

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
than the cloth braided hose then I take

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
than the cloth braided hose then I take
the<00:01:41.250> hoses<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.720> me<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> Phillips

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the hoses off this for me the Phillips

00:01:43.110 --> 00:02:12.610 
the hoses off this for me the Phillips
head<00:01:43.259> screwdriver

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.990 

you<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.770> see<00:02:13.950> when<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.070> pulled<00:02:14.340> them<00:02:14.460> off

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you can see when we pulled them off

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.970 
you can see when we pulled them off
why<00:02:15.600> don't<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.020> tube<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.740> got<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
why don't have this tube in it we got to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.740 
why don't have this tube in it we got to
make<00:02:17.100> sure<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.640> goes<00:02:17.820> back<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> top

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
make sure that that goes back in the top

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.160 
make sure that that goes back in the top
when<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.600> circulator<00:02:21.600> back<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.990> its

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
when we put the circulator back on its

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.540 
when we put the circulator back on its
going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.320> go<00:02:22.410> back<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.860> top<00:02:23.070> two<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.460> we've

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
going to go back in the top two so we've

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.240 
going to go back in the top two so we've
got<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.760> remember<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:25.010> replace<00:02:26.010> this

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
got to remember to do that replace this

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710 
got to remember to do that replace this
hose<00:02:26.460> here<00:02:26.490> which<00:02:26.970> actually<00:02:27.150> goes<00:02:27.450> back<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
hose here which actually goes back to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.840 
hose here which actually goes back to
the<00:02:27.930> tank<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.250> come<00:02:29.370> back<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
the tank we got to come back here and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.980 
the tank we got to come back here and
pull<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.120> gasket<00:02:30.420> off<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.870> will

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
pull this gasket off and then that will

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.570 
pull this gasket off and then that will
allow<00:02:37.170> us<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.320> fold<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.740> side<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> carpet

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
allow us to fold this side of the carpet

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.020 
allow us to fold this side of the carpet
down<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.580> goes<00:02:41.760> through<00:02:42.000> here

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
down you can see it goes through here

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.060 
down you can see it goes through here
and<00:02:42.660> down<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.200> tank<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:43.890> one

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
and down to the tank and it's just one

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.850 
and down to the tank and it's just one
clamp<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.550> holds<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.440> take<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.680> off

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
clamp that holds it on and take it off

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.960 
clamp that holds it on and take it off
with<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.070> Philips<00:02:47.370> head<00:02:47.459> screwdriver

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.820 

and<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.870> runs<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.260> these<00:02:57.410> little<00:02:57.620> brackets

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and it runs to these little brackets

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.380 
and it runs to these little brackets
right<00:02:58.190> here<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.550> see<00:02:58.700> someone's<00:02:59.030> bent<00:02:59.240> this

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
right here you see someone's bent this

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:12.870 
right here you see someone's bent this
one<00:02:59.570> down<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.410> one<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.770> bends<00:03:00.950> over<00:03:01.160> to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.250 

it's<00:03:13.880> pretty<00:03:14.120> much<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.450> that's<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.810> rule<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it's pretty much it that's the rule of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.720 
it's pretty much it that's the rule of
our<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.770> two<00:03:15.950> lines<00:03:16.220> we're<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.610> mess

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
our the two lines we're going to mess

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.030 
our the two lines we're going to mess
with<00:03:16.880> replacing<00:03:17.420> today<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.680> know<00:03:18.830> we're

with replacing today you know we're
gonna<00:03:19.130> go<00:03:19.340> cut<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> lines<00:03:19.880> make<00:03:20.720> up<00:03:20.870> like

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140

and put them back in okay we've made our

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.850 
and put them back in okay we've made our
hoses<00:03:25.970> up<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.900> was<00:03:27.080> pretty<00:03:27.380> simple<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.769> was

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
hoses up this was pretty simple it was

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.290 
hoses up this was pretty simple it was
just<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.099> straight<00:03:28.370> hose<00:03:28.610> it's<00:03:28.910> cut<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.120> the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
just a straight hose it's cut to the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.820 
just a straight hose it's cut to the
same<00:03:29.510> length<00:03:29.780> I'm<00:03:29.959> gonna<00:03:30.080> route<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> same

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
same length I'm gonna route it the same

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.009 
same length I'm gonna route it the same
way<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.910> original<00:03:32.330> one<00:03:32.420> was<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.870> I'm<00:03:32.930> gonna

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
way the original one was and I'm gonna

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.720 
way the original one was and I'm gonna
put<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.260> clamp<00:03:33.500> back<00:03:33.800> like<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.220> original<00:03:34.550> was

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
put a clamp back like the original was

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.960 
put a clamp back like the original was
this<00:03:35.660> one<00:03:35.840> was<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.989> little<00:03:36.110> more<00:03:36.319> work<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:37.459> had<00:03:37.940> to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
this one was a little more work I had to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.650 
this one was a little more work I had to
put<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> valves<00:03:38.690> on<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.160> fittings

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
put the valves on it and the fittings

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.759 
put the valves on it and the fittings
when<00:03:41.660> we<00:03:41.720> put<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.019> back<00:03:42.200> together<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:42.680> have

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
when we put this back together you have

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.380 
when we put this back together you have
to<00:03:42.920> make<00:03:43.100> sure<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.489> this<00:03:43.670> stays<00:03:43.819> upright

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
to make sure that this stays upright

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.120 
to make sure that this stays upright
like<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.080> can't<00:03:45.350> have<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.620> leaning<00:03:45.980> over

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
like so you can't have it leaning over

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.949 
like so you can't have it leaning over
like<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.819> has<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.209> make<00:03:47.480> sure<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.690> top

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
like that it has to be make sure you top

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.039 
like that it has to be make sure you top
right<00:03:48.200> make<00:03:48.530> sure<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:49.130> problem

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
right make sure the problem

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.660 
right make sure the problem
we're<00:03:51.049> going<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.200> use<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:52.160> clamps<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.519> we

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
we're going to use the clamps that we

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.400 
we're going to use the clamps that we
sell<00:03:52.850> here<00:03:53.000> International<00:03:53.660> Auto<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.989> edge<00:03:54.140> is

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
sell here International Auto the edge is

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.229 
sell here International Auto the edge is
our<00:03:54.530> rolled<00:03:54.920> over<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.580> you're<00:03:55.700> not<00:03:55.819> sharp

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
our rolled over and you're not sharp

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.059 
our rolled over and you're not sharp
like<00:03:56.510> regular<00:03:56.870> clamps<00:03:57.230> are<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:57.590> we'll<00:03:57.739> cut<00:03:57.980> the

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
like regular clamps are so we'll cut the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.580 
like regular clamps are so we'll cut the
hose<00:03:58.360> it's<00:03:59.360> probably<00:03:59.660> just<00:03:59.750> as<00:03:59.900> best<00:04:00.110> to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
hose it's probably just as best to

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.900 
hose it's probably just as best to
install<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.010> clamp<00:04:01.250> before<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.640> put<00:04:01.819> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
install the clamp before you put the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.500 
install the clamp before you put the
hose<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.420> makes<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.660> little<00:04:02.780> bit<00:04:02.870> easier<00:04:03.370> hey

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
hose on it makes a little bit easier hey

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.610 
hose on it makes a little bit easier hey
red<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.630> slide<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.019> over<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.260> length<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.560> the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
you want to break that clamp it into

you want to break that clamp it into
tight<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.830> certain<00:05:28.540> Frankie<00:05:29.540> I<00:05:29.570> believe<00:05:29.930> this

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
tight a certain Frankie I believe this

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.650 
tight a certain Frankie I believe this
is<00:05:30.260> where<00:05:30.410> a<00:05:30.440> problem<00:05:30.860> was<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:32.270> original

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
is where a problem was the original

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.880 
is where a problem was the original
image<00:05:32.900> did<00:05:33.050> not<00:05:33.200> have<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:33.410> very<00:05:33.680> good

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
image did not have a very good

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.070 
image did not have a very good
connection<00:05:34.070> or<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.610> came<00:05:34.760> off<00:05:35.030> real<00:05:35.270> easy<00:05:35.540> and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
connection or it came off real easy and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.750 
connection or it came off real easy and
I<00:05:36.410> think<00:05:36.620> that's<00:05:37.070> where<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.310> vapors<00:05:37.640> were

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
I think that's where the vapors were

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.810 
I think that's where the vapors were
escaping<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:39.320> silicone<00:05:39.800> hose<00:05:40.040> does<00:05:40.460> fit<00:05:40.790> a

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
escaping the silicone hose does fit a

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.750 
escaping the silicone hose does fit a
lot<00:05:41.000> tighter<00:05:41.590> hopefully<00:05:42.590> that's<00:05:42.800> gonna<00:05:42.980> solve

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
lot tighter hopefully that's gonna solve

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.060 
lot tighter hopefully that's gonna solve
the<00:05:43.940> problem<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:45.110> if<00:05:45.260> it<00:05:45.380> doesn't<00:05:45.620> I'll<00:05:45.920> go

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
the problem and if it doesn't I'll go

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.240 
the problem and if it doesn't I'll go
back<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.490> put<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.640> small<00:05:46.940> clamp<00:05:47.300> on<00:05:47.540> it<00:05:47.830> or<00:05:48.830> zip

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
back and put a small clamp on it or zip

00:05:49.250 --> 00:06:02.790 
back and put a small clamp on it or zip
tie

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.230 

to<00:06:03.800> make<00:06:03.980> sure<00:06:04.160> this<00:06:04.370> positions<00:06:04.940> itself

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
to make sure this positions itself

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.780 
to make sure this positions itself
properly<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:08.210> that's<00:06:08.300> it<00:06:08.510> we're<00:06:08.750> done
