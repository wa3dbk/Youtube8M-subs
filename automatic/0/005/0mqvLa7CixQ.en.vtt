 hi there, this is the channel odyssey kati and 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.059
 Sergey My name is Sergey today we 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.020
 talk about how to choose 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.020
 tent place 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.650
 the place for the tent should be flat and 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.160
 so looking for a flat place ahead let's go 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.160
 let's go look 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.239
 if there are stones on the court the car just 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.200
 them if there is a sharp bitch lying around 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.200
 then remove them 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.269
 night on the knots back bruised if 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.019
 protruding roots then put something 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.120
 soft 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.149
 or make pot still from branches with 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.149
 leaves 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:25.510
 do not put a tent on an anthill you them 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:25.510
 crush here they are there small 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.410
 if together where you put put 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.310
 tent there pits need to pour and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.310
 align proceed 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.170
 lie down and head up 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.170
 slope 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.740
 because if you lie down the opposite then with 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.740
 in the morning you can wake up with a swollen head 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.920
 no girl wrong do not put 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.720
 camp in the grooves of the night sudden 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.860
 rain can flood your tent 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.360
 do not put a tent near the fire 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.450
 the distance from the fire to the tent should 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.420
 be at least three meters 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:26.000
 because the tent is very painful for a long time 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.000
 let's burn from count 3 meters and 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:44.260
 put the tent away from the water as 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.790
 the water is cool and a lot of mosquitoes are not 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.490
 put a tent on the trail 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.590
 night of you may not spotyknutsya 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.610
 forget that it is better to put a tent in 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.500
 the shadows if you caught a thunderstorm then put 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.770
 tent away from the trees 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.530
 especially standing alone recommend not 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.250
 less than 15 meters there is an interesting 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.590
 statistics suddenly lightning beats most often 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 and never got to the birch tree 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.370
 case of rain you need to dig a tent 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.370
 dig a groove 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.280
 but first you need to put a tent 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.770
