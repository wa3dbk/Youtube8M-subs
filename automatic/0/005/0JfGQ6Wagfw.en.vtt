 nice for you dad girl I'll do you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 little things about the kraft technique but that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 beautiful lightning 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.320
 then the app primarily the good new 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.670
 draft should come to mind 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 a long time ago when two arrivals a thousand 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.769
 tutor tutorials subscribers on request 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 now one I'm telling you to do two his 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.789
 request if not b bombed of things 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.739
 however, a hashtag could be created from 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.030
 put in the kraft tech in which 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.050
 ask for a discussion of something 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.640
 could be like what the cable 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 best to use to carry 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 electricity how that thing works 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.789
 there that I showed in that episode 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.870
 got a shit 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.239
 and then the inherent question I recommend 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.860
 write the subject or if you don't know 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.240

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.710
 known town kraft 4 and the lava of 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 beautiful and the magic ars 3 neither the two 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.320

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.650

 rast 3 and the and the magic in the case though 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.230
 even the other fashions not only fashions me 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.110
 they are passionate because they don't have so many 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.220
 implications that we say those who join together 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.959
 to the other fashions of the pack, however, they are 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.269
