 I'm not chatting 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.689
 now that you are an honorary member of the Pythagorean society 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 I can reveal the secrets of the star 5 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 the two shorter segments added together danix 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.980

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.060
 aura 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.609
 the sum of the second and third segments 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.950
 results in the length of the fourth 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 the new cd sectional doors 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 but this is only the principle 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.980
 in the five-pointed star is the secret of the construction of the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.230
 golden rectangle that the Greeks appreciated both for its magnificent 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.610
 proportions than for its magic qualities 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.180
 the star contains an almost infinite series of golden rectangles

 I loved 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.870
 it is a fascinating geometric figure 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 it can mathematically reproduce an infinite number of times 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 all these rectangles have the same proportion

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.249
 this figure also contains a spiral that repeats endlessly 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.249
 the proportions of section a 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.470
 for the ancient Greeks the golden rectangle was the mathematical principle of the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.570
 beauty 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.679
 we find it in classical architecture 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.079
 the parthenon the most famous monument from Hellenic architecture contains 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.079
 many golden rectangles

 man 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.340

 r 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:01.969
 in the following centuries the golden rectangle continued to be the quintessence 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.259
 of architectural perfection throughout the western world 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 the cathedral of notre dame scenes from an example 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 the Renaissance painters knew the magic secret well 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.310
 and to this day the golden rectangle is an important place in our culture 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.849
 modern painters have also rediscovered the magic of his 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.849
 proportions 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.929

 nature is always a mathematical society 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.310
 but remember Donald Duck 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.310
 and in mathematics there is the concept of 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.960

 the profusion of nature geometric shapes 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.599

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.069
 everything is arranged according to mathematical deformed numbers
