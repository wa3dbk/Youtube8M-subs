00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.770 
crazy like it's a pattern in the span of
like<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.520> really<00:02:39.670> simplified<00:02:40.180> equation<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.660> it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
like a really simplified equation of it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.860 
like a really simplified equation of it
is<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.410> span<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.650> 10<00:02:42.610> minutes<00:02:42.870> we've

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
is that in the span of 10 minutes we've

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.699 
is that in the span of 10 minutes we've
spoken<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.880> 32,000<00:02:45.880> engaged<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:47.260> positive

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
spoken to 32,000 engaged like positive

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.440 
spoken to 32,000 engaged like positive
thinking<00:02:48.280> student<00:02:48.820> leaders<00:02:49.090> who<00:02:49.240> actually

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
thinking student leaders who actually

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.320 
thinking student leaders who actually
want<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.810> go<00:02:49.959> out<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.820> activate<00:02:51.820> change<00:02:52.120> in

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
want to go out and activate change in

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.660 
want to go out and activate change in
our<00:02:52.450> world
