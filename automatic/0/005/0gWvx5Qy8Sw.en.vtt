00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
collector this is definitely worth

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.220 
collector this is definitely worth
getting<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
getting because it's one of the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
getting because it's one of the
creepiest<00:00:40.800> looking<00:00:41.100> helmets<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> game

lackluster we got resolute provides

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.900 
lackluster we got resolute provides
unstoppable<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.649> fist<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> havoc<00:00:47.340> this

shoulder charge on the same build which

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
shoulder charge on the same build which
has<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.940> usefulness<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:55.350> also<00:00:55.500> got

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
has got some usefulness it's also got

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.150 
has got some usefulness it's also got
infusion<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> inverse<00:00:57.120> shadow<00:00:57.949> both<00:00:58.949> of

infusion and inverse shadow both of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.439 
infusion and inverse shadow both of
those<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.640> limited<00:01:00.239> usefulness

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
those are going to be limited usefulness

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.490 
those are going to be limited usefulness
in<00:01:00.989> PvP<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.190> useful<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.699> pv<00:01:03.059> ii<00:01:03.500> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
in PvP a little more useful in pv ii but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
in PvP a little more useful in pv ii but
this<00:01:04.619> thing<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.129> gets<00:01:05.460> outclassed<00:01:05.939> by

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this thing really gets outclassed by

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
this thing really gets outclassed by
things<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.659> armamentarium<00:01:07.260> even<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
things like the armamentarium even the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
things like the armamentarium even the
helm<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> most<00:01:08.820> light<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.659> unless<00:01:09.990> you're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
helm of the most light so unless you're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
helm of the most light so unless you're
a<00:01:10.229> collector<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.950> unless<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.640> like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a collector or unless you really like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
a collector or unless you really like
the<00:01:12.000> look<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.540> i'd<00:01:12.750> probably<00:01:13.290> give<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the look of it i'd probably give this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
the look of it i'd probably give this
one<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> pass<00:01:14.210> next<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.330> got<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> bones<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.229> EO

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
one a pass next we got the bones of EO

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.820 
one a pass next we got the bones of EO
this<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.549> most<00:01:17.880> fun<00:01:18.619> exotics<00:01:19.619> in

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this is one of the most fun exotics in

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.179 
this is one of the most fun exotics in
the<00:01:20.159> game<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> discipline<00:01:21.000> roll<00:01:21.210> 151<00:01:22.200> isn't

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the game the discipline roll 151 isn't

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
the game the discipline roll 151 isn't
bad<00:01:23.490> i<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.060> maxes<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.600> around<00:01:25.110> its

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
bad i think that maxes out around its

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.670 
bad i think that maxes out around its
166<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.750> awful<00:01:28.140> roll<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
166 so it's not an awful roll it's not a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
166 so it's not an awful roll it's not a
great<00:01:29.100> role<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> key<00:01:30.720> thing<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:31.259> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
great role but the key thing about this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.700 
great role but the key thing about this
is<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.250> exotic<00:01:32.729> perk<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.750> found<00:01:34.140> by<00:01:34.409> law

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is the exotic perk not found by law

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
is the exotic perk not found by law

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
control which allows you to speed around

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.130 
control which allows you to speed around
the<00:01:48.990> map<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:50.100> fun<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> use<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the map it's a very fun way to use a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.219 
the map it's a very fun way to use a
hunter<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.670> super<00:01:54.119> useful<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.750> high-level

PvE<00:01:55.950> play<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:57.060> super<00:01:57.509> useful<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:58.079> PvE<00:01:58.500> but

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
PvE play not super useful in PvE but

definitely<00:02:10.709> recommend<00:02:11.129> picking<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.969> up<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
definitely recommend picking this up and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.580 
definitely recommend picking this up and
playing<00:02:12.689> with<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.019> because<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.349> think<00:02:13.500> you'll

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
playing with it because I think you'll

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
playing with it because I think you'll
have<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.769> lot<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.950> fun<00:02:14.129> with<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.659> next<00:02:15.659> for<00:02:16.109> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
have a lot of fun with it next for the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
have a lot of fun with it next for the
Warlocks<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.799> got<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> void<00:02:17.189> Bank<00:02:17.430> vestments

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

strength<00:02:18.689> role<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.290> 159<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.909> very<00:02:21.269> high<00:02:21.510> i

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
strength role of 159 is not very high i

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.679 
strength role of 159 is not very high i
think<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.349> maxes<00:02:22.829> out<00:02:22.920> let's<00:02:23.129> see<00:02:23.280> here

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
think that one maxes out let's see here

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.449 
think that one maxes out let's see here
181<00:02:24.689> so<00:02:24.959> that's<00:02:25.140> that's<00:02:25.859> not<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.129> very<00:02:26.310> good

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
181 so that's that's not a very good

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.089 
181 so that's that's not a very good
role<00:02:26.879> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.329> strength<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.920> is

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
role on the strength but this is

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.800 
role on the strength but this is
definitely<00:02:29.370> worth<00:02:29.790> having<00:02:30.269> if<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.540> haven't

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
definitely worth having if you haven't

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.420 
definitely worth having if you haven't
