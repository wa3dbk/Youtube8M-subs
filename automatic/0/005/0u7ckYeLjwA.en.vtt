00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.610

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.930
 I'm not very good at the heights of 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.930

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.630

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 up to the bicycles to see how I climb 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.930

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.050
 and we did it 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.810
 as they do not put a sign that says here 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.880
 we are at war I had no other option 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.880
 to choose a side and fight for my life 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.449
 goodbye 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.840

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.780

 Enough inof with so much foreign 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.110
 turning around I hoped it looked good 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.930
 Of course now I did opt for the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.770
 rest so I went straight to 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.770
 the hotel's hot springs 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.850
 and the nightlife in the snow is a 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.650
 safety pin 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.050

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.900
