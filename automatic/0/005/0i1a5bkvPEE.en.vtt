sounds I've got the speaker stuck on the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.619 
sounds I've got the speaker stuck on the
floor<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> maybe<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.329> can't

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
floor here so much and maybe we can't

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.869 
floor here so much and maybe we can't
hear<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.260> well<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.640> with

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
hear that so well so what we can do with

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
hear that so well so what we can do with
this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.840> rotate<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> view

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this is we can rotate that to that view

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
this is we can rotate that to that view
and<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.649> three<00:00:59.010> different<00:00:59.190> windows<00:00:59.820> then

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and we get three different windows then

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
and we get three different windows then
we<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> chat<00:01:00.660> window<00:01:01.160> open<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
we can have a chat window open and so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.350 
we can have a chat window open and so
that<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.769> connect<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> chat<00:01:05.700> show<00:01:06.150> which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that will connect to the chat show which

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
that will connect to the chat show which
is<00:01:06.510> nice<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> other<00:01:07.140> live<00:01:07.350> stuff<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.890> you
