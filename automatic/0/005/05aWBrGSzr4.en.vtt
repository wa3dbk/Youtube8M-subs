now the next item is the flashlight any
time<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> flashlight<00:02:04.109> you<00:02:04.500> should

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
time you have a flashlight you should

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
time you have a flashlight you should
store<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> batteries<00:02:05.520> outside<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
attention of other drivers now as far as
