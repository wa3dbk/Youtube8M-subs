00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello and welcome to mini machine 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.779
 today we will talk about a real 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 mini machine the shuttle ds 61 as I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.750
 Assume it is a machine that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 did not have a public vocation 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.480
 shottle confirmed it was a good 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.190
 gear industrial use 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.660
 now there are a lot of interests 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.770
 around this of this gear all 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 simply because it is compact and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.199
 who can ship very processors 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.599
 very very powerful and suddenly I'll be there 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.810
 think about a more implementation 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.730
 massive with the individuals of this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 little ds 61 which is my faith enough 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.360
 interesting let's go the detail is all from 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.680
 then in the box we have 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.090
 obviously the machine itself see 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 you can see it's really all 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.520
 small compared to my hand from the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 documentation with a nice doc in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.989
 French which explains well in detail 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.050
 all the elements that to know about 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.280
 the angel to pilots on a cd of the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.870
 thermal paste simply because 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.579
 the machine is delivered without a processor 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.989
 so it will have to be installed 1 and for 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.640
 install it you have to put some dough 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.409
 thermal to facilitate contact 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.979
 between the processor and the system of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.600
 dissipation a big fat chargers that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.310
 Looks like a big laptop charger 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 for once to see when we can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.650
 even have processor weights 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.750
 very powerful this machine needs 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.549
 able to feed them and so a little 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.880
 cable a small power cable that is a 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.830
 rather traditional flat cable 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.820
 for the machine itself for its 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.560
 package we discover a craft that in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.710
 himself is pretty much enough 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.049
 pretty impressive compact 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.460
 in many ways, especially 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.890
 robustness is really dangerous that has 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.420
 been built to be sturdy and one 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.610
 feel the industrial side in the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.070
 design that is not necessarily it's not 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.600
 necessarily the most beautiful gear you 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.479
 to meet is rather a 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.440
 industrial design 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.869
 now it's really a machine that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.670
 is super robust and that is intended for 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.979
 to be shipped just about anywhere in 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.570
 any conditions we will do 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.070
 the detail right away from what the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.020
 up 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.810
 to start with so this this hull 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.509
 made of very strong metal 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.280
 there that is really really the machine 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.739
 is quite heavy it's really all in 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 metal is really very solid first 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.239
 thing that we notice so this is this 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.440
 double aeration there on the top there is 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.910
 two fans below so that's 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.739
 not at all a gear that is fanless there 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.569
 there is an active ventilation system 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.560
 in now will have to see a little 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.830
 little that can give 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.630
 we have openings on each side a 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.730
 wii is also in the back and on the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.880
 below we notice these two species of 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.730
 here are the system 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.170
 snagging visa of the machine so in 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.860
 do we have small thumb screws here 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 we can remove 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.400
 we hang his two little tabs 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.660
 at the back of a screen and we will be able to 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.739
 attach the case to the back of a hall 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.330
 to repeat in the fangs for it 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.560
 take take the step of class it is 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.650
 also a solution to be able to 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.549
 fixed is simply under a piece of furniture 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.890
 or in any solution 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.340
 really boarded we can go the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.480
 hide a little bit anywhere at the level of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.340
 connectivity we have a set that is 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.519
 rather rich in the facade we find ourselves 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.220
 with two usb 2.0 ports a micro port a 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.070
 headphone port a sdhc card reader 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.459
 full size and power button 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.380
 which is used to start the machine is 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.150
 everything on the back side by cons 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.000
 has a lot of things connectors 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.130
 of USB port network ports 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.319
 3 0 recognize their blue color 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.319
 feature a hdmi output a 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.450
 dvi output two serial ports are 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.829
 also present which testifies well to 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.660
 this industrial side no one 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.889
 do not use serial ports today 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.430
 it's really to drive two 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.739
 robots or things ddd robot others 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.019
 it's really the remains of the world 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.459
 industrial who are on this machine 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.010
 Also note that there is a port 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.079
 antitheft that is well placed which located on 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.790
 the side here and who once he is 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.590
 fixed and not only prevents the machine 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.180
 to be stolen but in addition to fishing 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.130
 the opening of the gear cover including 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.930
 to avoid going rummage what 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.150
 is inside 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.920
 so we can put two young people 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.310
 each side is so it's really 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.689
 very very securable 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.670
 once we have removed the two small 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.959
 screw there I do them I do them forward 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.519
 once we have removed the two small 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.810
 screws that are at the back of the machine 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:21.430
 we can eclipse the top and open 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:25.060
 the craft here and there we will discover what 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.949
 that there is in the machine to know so 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.610
 here we see a big fat big 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.919
 aluminum heat sink with two 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.979
 fans above a location 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.780
 here for a ssd disk or a disk 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.530
 mechanical in 2.5 inch format 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.259
 the connectivity that serves to connect it to the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.289
 machine and so we froze also removed 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.030
 forward but here we have a small screw and 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.729
 if we take away this little life it's 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:57.009
 we raise those here have it here 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.650
 that this is the extension small 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.509
 support to restore the ssd disk in 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.120
 underneath we discover two locations of 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:07.870
 very standard RAM so this is the 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.310
 memory so-dimm for laptops we have them 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.409
 motherboard slots so 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.289
 attack one recognizes here and there a port 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.710
 mini pci that can be operated in half 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.570
 format 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.340
 it is equipped to be a half size 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.470
 or in full format typically for 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.639
 put a wifi card in the heart of 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.349
 the default gear there is no card 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.940
 wifi to two ethernet ports but there is no 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.030
 wifi card in the machine so if we 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.440
 wants wifi it must be installed for 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.500
 to access the processors it is necessary to remove 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.909
 all the screws that are here and that are 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.940
 spring-mounted will do that all of 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.940
 after 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.080
 that's when we remove the four 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.110
 vices that come on around the socket 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.360
 it's a socket lga1155 when we remove 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.560
 the cases 10 we find here that are 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.610
 we can not lose them 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.290
 so we discover a classic socket 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.480
 two machines in 55 that we will be able 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.030
 so integrate a processor to 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.930
 inside and evolve it 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.600
 also 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.280
 it's very very classical, we notice the 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.330
 dissipation solution is enough enough 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.970
 damn good at shuttle was January 1 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.190
 first part of dissipation that is 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.720
 a copper part with heat pipes 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.180
 who come to carry heat on 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.440
 all the aluminum fins and 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.150
 so this is a solution that should 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.530
 cool despite the compactness of 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.030
 the device 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.040
 as a reminder we can climb in there 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.690
 process a core i7 processor so 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.180
 to really help machines enough 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.650
 powerful and not necessarily in 17 watts 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.960
 but we can go to 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.120
 processors in 65 watts of tdp so 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.890
 really high performance processors 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.080
 so it's very simple to put in 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.850
 work a processor install one or 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.730
 two memory sticks a card 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.730
 pci mini pci-express if you need it 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.430
 a storage on the bucket extension which 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.770
 comes with our firm all we did 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.389
 more than install a system 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.830
 is we are ready for a machine 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.270
 which works so it's a machine 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.319
 we will discover in a test a small 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.150
 little later me what interests me 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:14.900
 with this brood and its evolutionary side 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.159
 we have a real memory socket lga2011 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.259
 Long live the opportunity to put a record 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:22.759
 hard or a ssd 2.5 inches to one's choice 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:25.069
 it's less compact than an intel neck 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.419
 but more scalable in its range 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.669
 in my opinion it is a craft that is 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:30.740
 interesting will want to see how much it will be 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:31.960
 actually marketed if it comes in 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.340
 shop in France for individuals 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.530
 is also how much is the 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.720
 global solution to try to imagine 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.889
 to put that in a living room will look 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.620
 also if it heats 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.780
 if the ventilation is good and if we 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.849
 can imagine having that behind her 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.370
 telly without having a sound of a factory in 

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.659
 permanence with you so here is a 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.620
 test that happens very soon on mini 

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:53.620
 machine soon
