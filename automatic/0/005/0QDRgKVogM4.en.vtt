00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.290
 a brief presentation of the editor 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.160
 keolis produced with ttx technology 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:28.900
 for yeast gs we say old 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.660
 non-profit model wanted this bearer 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.680
 because bmw has always been a 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.420
 important brand then used the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.340
 better than at the moment there is what 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.320
 it is used in motogp and is used 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.489
 in super bacteria precisely ti pikes peak is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.190
 basically a double mount 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.800
 tube gives great advantages because 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.620
 manages to work at lower pressure 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.539
 lower to an internal balance e 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.770
 much more for which the feeling the 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.390
 feeling of the pilot and other for those 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.670
 which are also our tests too 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.640
 personal because I wine this bike that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.410
 the increase in comfort is enormous 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 increases security because death 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.090
 much more stable so you're more 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.979
 comfortable that you are safer in 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.930
 especially the passenger not having you that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.330
 do not have dry shots in the apples here 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.000
 piece of the road or in the thousand says 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.710
 when it loads there is not this 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.450
 feeling of having to drive a 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.070
 chopper will do much much more what it is 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.479
 however with the sway that yes 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.450
 triggers some pd on the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.970
 street and has the main feature 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.439
 to make driving more discs enjoyable 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.299
 to death remains and sustained e 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.799
 simultaneously it remains slightly 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.079
 we also do on a journey of 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.579
 hundreds of miles when you arrive 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.549
 the difference just having your back to 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.530
 pieces and instead is still feeling with 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.140
 the desire to do another way 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.780
 We are fully adjustable region 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.579
 then compression and return and the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.920
 manettino that is screwed through 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:10.060
 printing to the outside for 3 to load the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.670
 spring to understand a rear e 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:19.030
 also the requested motorcycle material of 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:22.090
 ttx technology so i guess i give you a 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 advice is a good area and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.040
 asking you to try it because when 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.300
 you make kilometers is really a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.520
 important investment for the back 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.620
 for health especially the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.239
 motorcyclist for the pleasure of driving 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.239
 the death of sending the death of a kingdom 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.129
 would complain about problems
