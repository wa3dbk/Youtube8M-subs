00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 if there is a problem in the private sphere 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.359
 thanks to this moment a bit too easy but it is not that 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.070
 just because the football is always something happening it is something going on 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.390
 that you woke up extended once but once 19 17 this was not our blood 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.119
 but it is true that the beernem johan jesus is wearing 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 that's all too 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.079
 the closing post 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.140
 at least that it has been the intention in other areas that they stress 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.440
 finally turned because you think the right to health insurance allowance click send 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.140
 no time for a photo session rotterdam is a press conference 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.590
 the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.320
 I personally also find a moment with us on human rights 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 3 I analyze 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 that situation 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.410
 mmm teen challenged the decision not to the situation yet but i don't want to 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.350
 so say you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 paul kieve not opposed at all 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 you are a warm-blooded man yes 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.300
 only slightly was that you check with checked store 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.370
 let it influence a decision for a while 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.680
 but what appears from a warm-blooded 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.050
 so if you think so 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.050
 vemke with the people 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.950
 but that does not mean that it influences in the decision he must 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.980
 you turn it off 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.520
 was a big difference 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.510
 between b those few hours that spend or that panic that I know I'm somewhere 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.100
 different 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.490
 more people might be very important 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.720
 I think the most important thing 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.080
 the foundation 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.260
 always little 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.740
 why not him 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 being the friend so special is that the church in their spending 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.899
 bosworth in friendship 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.789
 the moment you need them or see them here 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.139
 until 2014 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.949
 what should you be there and then you can also say everything 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.949
 you are also changing 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.489
 make the friendship stand out 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.579
 yes what time you notice i am 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.029
 The fixed net said that does not concern a keeper who brought dynamo no mistakes 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:32.649
 that I have 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.939
 too little football with us 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.509
 But he doesn't say too little 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.629
 but if you coke it was just because it is no longer retelling 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.409
 most errors 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.719
 in the cube the error would be more dangerous 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.719
 That is why the wrong change is for the future 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.349
 what is your opinion 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.989
 but now that the bus is a bible medieval later what belongs to it 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.719
 I think something dekker has here 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.789
 who knows can see 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.749
 when we are all together 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.869
 much further goes with all together 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.549
 and who will lead at some point 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.199
 I think that policy for the greatest father 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.199
 I think so but I think for example you are not there 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.199
 can think that i got from him 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.969
 throwing in the trash that you would at one point became a collective agreement 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.349
 spreading a kind of people should help 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.649
 that is still laughing that situation sees all the qualities got in white 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.279
 cloth 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.699
 but you believe there is an obsessed good god 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.789
 cuckoo culture believe in god in the goodness of god of course they can 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:39.959
 help and shine there 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.959
 you are, however, a forest on the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.999
 I'm not complaining 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.690
 terribly important interest from heaven 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.539
 and that cannot be otherwise 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.749
 all you have to do and on Thursday the profession to which it belongs 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.499
 he also played a role in debates with klaas faber 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.659
 the practice international of pride 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.299
 We are glad that you regularly have contact with a woman that you like you 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.579
 something has to decide 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.989
 talk to him 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.659
 well not aware 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.659
 but i'm sure if switzerland it's balanced 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.469
 go over the case 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:16.979
 I point out 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.579
 That's why I'm not going to know where you are standing on a legitimate fire 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.809
 so then I sometimes think books get the doctrine of faith 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.409
 I understand that he sometimes talks 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.939
 asks for advice 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.269
 I mean that is not the reason you sit down they demand a place to sleep 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.020
 i think i am about afghanistan problem is that your head 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.710
 I am now 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.960
 in the catacombs of the other I hope she is the result 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.670
 patron saint our village the players stepped up and neighborhood investigations 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.030
 my life
