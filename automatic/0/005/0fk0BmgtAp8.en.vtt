00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.040
No No No 8 is too less! No way!

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.000
9.. is also not profitable for me. Raise it a bit more!

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.880
10! Yes 10 is final. Lock it! Done deal!

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.120
Yeya! Sold it! The entire thing in 10!

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.900
What exactly did you sell?

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.900
I sold it in 10 crore!

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.320
Yes yes but what exactly? Tellme! I may also buy 3 4 kgs of it!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.020
Ramzan! I sold Ramzan transmission to “Baba Pampers” in 10 crore!

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.680
10 CRORE????

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.040
I knew about the inflation in Ramzan but never knew you can sell Ramzan itself in such high price!

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.140
*dance*

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.260
This is no time to wake people up for sehri!

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:18.660
*Oil, Juice, Clothes, Milk, Makeup, Spices, Easyload! Everything is Islamic. Do buy this offer*

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.640
How can Islam be SO commercial?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.160
This advertisement is brought to you by “Dabbu Dhol”

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.360
Viewers! The prayer call is brought to you by “Polluted Oil Ltd”

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.420
And the prayer for fasting is sponsored by “Lashkara Mascara”

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.680
And I almost forgot to tell you, the prayer for ending the fast…..

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.080
No No No.. I will recite that prayer. “Khatta Juice” have sponsored me for it.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.500
You are mistaken. “Kacha Milk” has sponsored me for it.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.840
Cut this prayer. Leave it. We don’t have a sponsor for this one.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.800
I fail to understand how far we can go to degrade Ramzan.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.700
Hey hey! What are you blabbing about the sponsor?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.340
Do you know your program is also sponsored by “Baba Pamper”

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.780
But sir??

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.480
No no!

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.220
But?

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.120
Shhss. Quiet. They have paid us for this.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.180
Ufhh. “Baba Pamper” you should go for it too!

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.520
How did it go? Wasn’t I perfect?
