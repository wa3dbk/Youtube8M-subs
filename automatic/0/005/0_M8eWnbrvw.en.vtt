00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
of the block it's actually easier than

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
of the block it's actually easier than
doing<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> regular<00:00:39.180> standing<00:00:39.660> problem<00:00:39.809> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
block so it's not a front handspring

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
block so it's not a front handspring
I'll<00:01:03.090> show<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> handspring<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I'll show you for a handspring so you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
in a way the second part to this move is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800 
in a way the second part to this move is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
II just a regular dash ball up this the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
II just a regular dash ball up this the
death<00:01:24.799> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> basic<00:01:26.189> ball<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.640> i

death this is a basic ball so i

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
death this is a basic ball so i
recommend<00:01:26.970> knowing<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.450> knowing<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
recommend knowing this knowing it really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
recommend knowing this knowing it really
well<00:01:28.259> before<00:01:28.409> attempting<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.070> movie<00:01:29.310> okay

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
well before attempting this movie okay

well before attempting this movie okay
so<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> few<00:01:30.930> progressions<00:01:31.470> before

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
so there are a few progressions before

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.980 
so there are a few progressions before
trying<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> confront<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.909> shell<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.600> first<00:01:33.840> one

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

will be a double column you need to have

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.980 
will be a double column you need to have
a<00:01:35.610> solid<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.240> come<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.630> able<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> get

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
that initial push and be able to judge
the<00:01:39.390> distance<00:01:39.570> between<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.110> two<00:01:40.229> objects

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the distance between the two objects

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
the distance between the two objects
you're<00:01:40.860> trying<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> move<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you're trying to do the move over so a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:52.030 
you're trying to do the move over so a
double<00:01:42.899> calm

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.930 

what's<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.250> important<00:01:53.580> at<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> double

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
what's really important at the double

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.050 
what's really important at the double
calm<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.660> first<00:01:55.200> Kong<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.550> ability<00:01:56.940> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
golf okay so to start this move I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.390 
golf okay so to start this move I
recommend<00:02:22.410> starting<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:23.010> something<00:02:23.310> that's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
recommend starting on something that's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.300 
recommend starting on something that's
short<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:24.240> no<00:02:24.480> gap<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.080> between<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
short with no gap in between so if you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.710 
short with no gap in between so if you
