as<00:00:55.710> much<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.670> they're<00:00:56.940> free

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
as much as you want because they're free

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
as much as you want because they're free
they<00:00:58.020> recharge<00:00:58.410> pretty<00:00:58.710> quickly<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.280> can

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
they recharge pretty quickly so you can

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
they recharge pretty quickly so you can
get<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.879> large<00:01:00.180> numbers<00:01:00.719> relatively

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
get them in large numbers relatively

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
get them in large numbers relatively
quickly<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.510> like<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.049> said<00:01:04.290> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
quickly like like I kind of just said I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
quickly like like I kind of just said I
don't<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.900> come<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.229> handy

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
don't know so these will come in handy

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800 
don't know so these will come in handy
especially<00:01:08.030> because<00:01:09.030> Sun<00:01:09.270> comes<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> lot

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
especially because Sun comes a lot

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
especially because Sun comes a lot
slower<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.439> sunflowers<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.159> night<00:01:13.549> problem

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
slower for sunflowers at night problem

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
slower for sunflowers at night problem
with<00:01:14.670> pushers<00:01:15.270> though<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.840> they're<00:01:16.110> really

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
with pushers though is they're really

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
with pushers though is they're really
short<00:01:16.830> range<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.670> they're<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:18.270> strong

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
short range and they're not very strong

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.070 
short range and they're not very strong
I<00:01:20.630> mean<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> expect<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.500> three<00:01:22.799> no

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
I mean what can you expect the three no

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
I mean what can you expect the three no
but<00:01:25.080> thankfully<00:01:25.650> since<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.430> plant<00:01:26.640> them

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
but thankfully since you can plant them

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.270 
but thankfully since you can plant them
so<00:01:26.909> quickly<00:01:28.009> they<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.549> come<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.729> handy

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.350 

it's<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.400> about<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> timing<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's all about the timing and the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.569 
it's all about the timing and the
placement<00:01:39.619> yeah<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.280> son's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
placement yeah you can see my son's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
placement yeah you can see my son's
really<00:01:42.150> coming<00:01:42.450> slow<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.110> there's<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.470> but

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really coming slow like there's one but

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
really coming slow like there's one but
it's<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.640> slow<00:01:45.090> which<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.049> why<00:01:46.290> I'll

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it's really slow which is why I'll

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.139 
it's really slow which is why I'll
definitely<00:01:46.680> need<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.399> two<00:01:47.460> rows<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
definitely need my two rows that I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.889 
definitely need my two rows that I
usually<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:50.090> otherwise<00:01:51.090> I'll<00:01:51.240> never<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.720> any

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
usually do otherwise I'll never get any
