00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:13.210
 ah ah 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.439
 hello and welcome to the site of 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.240
 chooz of the year points like and we're going 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.950
 we continue with the cost of Christmas 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.419
 so last time we did a 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.419
 courses with this design there 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 today we will continue with that 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.110
 there next 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 so I'll start by putting some 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.790
 white white of white on my nails 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.850
 for now peace I will use the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.989
 fos green home pretty girls it's 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.900
 the first time I use I am 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:57.730
 not very fan of the glass so there I 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:01.690
 I'm going to see what I'm doing 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:08.890
 always take my stamp to the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:18.760
 place I spend there was on the return 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:24.549
 of the screen but I do remake recalled 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:30.640
 that we recover with the buffer and we 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.970
 tampon especially the nail here it is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.660
 cleans the trader 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.310
 so that's what it gives for 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.950
 Nothing 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 so we have small leaves of holly 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.979
 so there then I cleaned all the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.259
 outline of my nails 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.850
 where I've stamped everything in green for 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.439
 once onovo you at the angles without 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.990
 clean the goal it's going to be to dismiss 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:56.030
 little red balls so here I have 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.470
 took glitter to red metallic mm 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.720
 so if you do not want masters 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.220
 you leave them like that you can 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.539
 possibly put on top 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.399
 also I do it quickly but take 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.500
 a red liner for example and then do 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.979
 your little dots or do it on the back 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 thing toul 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.410
 it may be more practical 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.640
 besides that collide and iron 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.000
 with red arches over 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 example if you want to have renderings 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.650
 more end 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.079
 and so you do that especially the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.079
 nails and huila no 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:57.530
 for people who start nail art 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.140
 and who do not know yet 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.610
 buy 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.160
 when they were offered two thing to there 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.900
 they are not hotter than that or steam 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.239
 I did not see the usefulness of the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.410
 fingers thing toul yet that makes 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.120
 part of tools really buy 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.349
 really first when we when we 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.760
 start in the bars it's really 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:27.130
 super helpful and ting and we can do 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:27.130
 lots of stuff including points 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.920
 at least I think it's a lot of 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.329
 all of a sudden that's what it gives to 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.599
 this decoration is always 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.290
 relatively simple after sugars 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.700
 barley is the holly leaves so 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.719
 this one I'm doing with small 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.629
 glitter if you really want some 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.879
 reflections of red reflections and that it 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.069
 do a little bit 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.180
 go there I'm waiting for my points 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.909
 red it's a little bit before 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.859
 pass my my top coat we always do 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:07.209
 attention with the standing of a sudden at 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:12.010
 middle a lot on the sides and we do not 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.260
 touch bigger and so once that 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.859
 you have finished let yourself dry and 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.169
 then you pass oil for good 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:28.210
 moisturize everyone small culture 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:32.610
 hit it there too and so that's it 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.610
 for that small of course Feuilloux 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.090
 so ditto I put you all the pictures 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.969

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.439

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.429
 new christmas decoration 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.379
 I do not know what I'm going to do yet 

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:55.429
 but I would even be tempted by 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:58.279
 the wind for small 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:05:00.439
 I do not know there are a lot of stuff 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.549

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.679
