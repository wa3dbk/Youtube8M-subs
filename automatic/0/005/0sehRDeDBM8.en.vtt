00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.829 
a craft stamp pad to fill an open space

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
inks to see what kind of results you're

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
inks to see what kind of results you're
going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.789> get<00:01:20.969> here<00:01:21.390> I've<00:01:21.539> stamped<00:01:21.780> whisper

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
going to get here I've stamped whisper

going to get here I've stamped whisper
white<00:01:23.060> from<00:01:24.060> Stampin<00:01:24.420> Up<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
white from Stampin Up and this is the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.649 
white from Stampin Up and this is the
snow<00:01:29.340> cap<00:01:29.549> from<00:01:29.820> Adirondack<00:01:30.450> Ranger

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.059 

and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.799> this<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.039> frost<00:01:36.460> white<00:01:37.859> from<00:01:38.859> color

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
and then this is frost white from color

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.789 
and then this is frost white from color
box<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:40.899> just<00:01:41.109> kind<00:01:41.259> of<00:01:41.289> gives<00:01:41.350> me<00:01:41.530> an

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
box and this just kind of gives me an

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.620 
box and this just kind of gives me an
idea<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.189> what<00:01:42.640> kind<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.880> coverage<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.329> can<00:01:43.479> get

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
idea of what kind of coverage I can get

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.209 
idea of what kind of coverage I can get
from<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> different<00:01:44.170> inks<00:01:44.439> you'll<00:01:44.920> see<00:01:45.069> that

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
from the different inks you'll see that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.529 
from the different inks you'll see that
the<00:01:45.340> snow<00:01:45.520> cap<00:01:45.729> white<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.090> quite<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.329> bit

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
the snow cap white is quite a bit

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.669 
the snow cap white is quite a bit
lighter<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.950> whisper<00:01:48.759> white<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.469> color<00:01:50.469> box

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
lighter than whisper white and color box

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.099 
lighter than whisper white and color box
I<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.899> water<00:01:53.259> brush<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.920> one<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.310> just<00:01:54.609> a

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
I use a water brush this one is just a

a little bit more subtle coverage and it

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.570 
a little bit more subtle coverage and it
actually<00:03:44.080> works<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:44.530> conjunction<00:03:44.830> with<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
actually works in conjunction with the

two different kinds of pads you can

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.780 
two different kinds of pads you can
