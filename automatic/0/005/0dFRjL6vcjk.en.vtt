using the vertical brush it's a lot

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.250 
using the vertical brush it's a lot
easier<00:05:23.130> if<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.570> didn't<00:05:24.780> have<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.020> vertical

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.140 
brush you'd be definitely bending your
paintbrush<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:34.010> also<00:05:35.010> causing<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.640> bristles

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
paintbrush and also causing the bristles

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.660

to<00:05:36.450> spread<00:05:37.230> apart<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.890> not<00:05:38.040> keep<00:05:38.340> its<00:05:38.550> shape

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
to spread apart and not keep its shape

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.660 
to spread apart and not keep its shape
so<00:05:39.360> that's<00:05:40.170> why<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.530> like<00:05:40.830> having<00:05:41.280> this<00:05:41.400> side
