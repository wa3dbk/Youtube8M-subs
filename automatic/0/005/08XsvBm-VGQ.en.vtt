00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
order to knock that back end off now I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
order to knock that back end off now I
was<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> little<00:01:03.570> difficult<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.260> first<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.920> know

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
was a little difficult at first you know

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
was a little difficult at first you know
it<00:01:05.280> takes<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.729> time<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> take<00:01:06.360> some

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
it takes some time and take some

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.940 
it takes some time and take some
practice<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> literally<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
practice but you literally just want to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
practice but you literally just want to
start<00:01:08.220> ramming<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.869> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
start ramming into things I know it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
start ramming into things I know it's
gonna<00:01:10.140> sound<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.710> stupid<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:12.030> as

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
gonna sound really stupid but it's as

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.170 
gonna sound really stupid but it's as
simple<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.500> once<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
simple as that and once you do that that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
simple as that and once you do that that
back<00:01:15.509> end<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.990> gonna<00:01:16.110> pop<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.100> we

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
back end is gonna pop right off and we

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
back end is gonna pop right off and we
found<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.939> simple<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
found it's really simple to do it on you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
found it's really simple to do it on you
know<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.860> big<00:01:20.820> cylinder

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
areas you hit those once twice maybe

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
areas you hit those once twice maybe
three<00:01:25.830> four<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.460> five<00:01:26.490> however<00:01:27.060> many<00:01:27.360> times<00:01:27.420> it
