00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.429
 gradually 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.390
 in 2008 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.480
 probably would lead 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 expeditions 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.380
 generally 14 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.510
 all this will spawn equipment 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 I keep searching for a source in the area 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.190
 Yuri Seagull Cabinet Source 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 it was known that no 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.320
 yes what will be the source 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319
 the same force 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.530
 roof installation 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.460
 I believe that among students 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 I want to say we lost 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.870
 Lenin is not always the case 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 In November 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 we have a fire hazard 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 they will choose restructuring 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
 as the best 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.670
 this time can meet to 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 now I am only asking my own 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 rolled steel 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 there were rumors 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.490
 you know what i will do 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 except he is not 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.559
 this is seen during the test
