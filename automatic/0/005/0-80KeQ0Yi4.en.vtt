I<00:05:06.800> really<00:05:07.460> don't<00:05:07.610> i<00:05:08.199> think<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:09.770> universe

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
I really don't i think that the universe

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.749 
I really don't i think that the universe
one<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.880> closer<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.509> g1<00:05:11.840> than<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.650> one<00:05:12.860> and

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
one is closer to g1 than that one and

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.999 
one is closer to g1 than that one and
that's<00:05:14.090> unusual<00:05:14.330> because<00:05:14.840> universe<00:05:15.380> make

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
that's unusual because universe make

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.800 
that's unusual because universe make
them<00:05:16.159> look<00:05:16.280> like<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.759> but<00:05:16.909> not<00:05:17.120> quite<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.659> same
