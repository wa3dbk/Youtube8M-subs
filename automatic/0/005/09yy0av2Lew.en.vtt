00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.140
 hi all beetle then blueberries 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.390
 home furniture is often affected by small 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.519
 beetle thrower nicknames it can 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.009
 detect by a small hole on 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.310
 furniture surfaces from holes 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.300
 yellowish dust is poured out 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.269
 representing crushed 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.789
 wood passed through the intestines of beetles 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.300
 the same whale blueberries grind exclusively 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.090
 dry wood adult beetles 35 long 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.190
 millimeters displayed at the beginning of May and 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.340
 the first two or three weeks live in no way 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.590
 feeding and not destroying the wood then 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.289
 females lay their eggs in old moves 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.620
 or on a rough wood surface 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.480
 in the cracks and cuts and hare weeks through 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.600
 two short white larvae hatch 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.449
 that bump inside the wood and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.719
 doing out twisty moves and more often 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.269
 total along the layers of wood than before 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.340
 the pest will be detected the more successful 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.480
 the fight against it therefore follows at least 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.610
 twice a year 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.460
 inspect the furniture especially at the bottom 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.890
 parts to prevent the appearance of the beetle 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.140
 then blueberries need to make sure that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.810
 the apartment did not accumulate wooden flom 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.850
 and in the coals often air the room is not 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.700
 should be brought indoors furniture on 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.860
 which there are summer hole not 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.040
 treating it with pre chemical 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.980
 substances recommended one to two times 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.900
 year wipe non varnished 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.030
 unpainted pieces of furniture with a rag 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.050
 moistened in fluoride solution or 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.450
 silicon fluoride sodium 200 250 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.100
 grams per bucket of hot water solution 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.600
 thoroughly stirred and after cooling 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.730
 used to process furniture 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.920
 infected bugs sharpened nicknames 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.100
 larvae extermination should be applied 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.030
 mixtures of three parts of turpentine with one 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 parts of kerosene saturated solution 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.770
 naphthalene in gasoline petroleum jelly 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.930
 the latter are most suitable for 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 processing items intended for 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.740
 food storage as it is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.560
 not 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.080
 has a smell beetles then kettles do not destroy 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.290
 only wooden furniture but also whole houses 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.090
 turns into dust if in the floor or in 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 small wooden walls appeared 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.460
 round holes and heaps below them 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.880
 brown dust is a sure sign that 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.530
 blueberry whales appeared in the apartment 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.810
 along with them the fight can be compositions 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.150
 above it is also possible 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.000
 apply a solution consisting of three 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.330
 parts of turpentine of one part of naphthalene and 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.270
 one part of the tar if the bugs settled 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.540
 thick logs at home when processing 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.140
 infected sites need to use more 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.350
 I wish everyone good luck for now 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.350
 until
