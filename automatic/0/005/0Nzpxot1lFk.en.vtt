check the engine coolant level and tell

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
check the engine coolant level and tell
me<00:00:49.290> how<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.680> check<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> engine

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
me how you will check that the engine

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.959 
me how you will check that the engine
has<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> correct<00:00:51.030> level<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.850> do

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
has the correct level so what we do

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
has the correct level so what we do
first<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.450> identify<00:00:55.020> where<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.739> engine

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
first is identify where the engine

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
first is identify where the engine
coolant<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.180> pointing

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
coolant is that's the one I'm pointing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470 
coolant is that's the one I'm pointing
out<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.899> now<00:00:59.059> the<00:01:00.059> way<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.450> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
out right now the way you're going to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
out right now the way you're going to
recognize<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.079> thing<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.500> by<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> symbol<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
recognize this thing is by the symbol on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.790 
recognize this thing is by the symbol on
top<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:03.030> looks<00:01:03.360> like<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> thermometer<00:01:04.050> symbol

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
top it looks like a thermometer symbol

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.900 
top it looks like a thermometer symbol
that's<00:01:05.190> how<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.430> remember<00:01:05.759> it's<00:01:05.850> about

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
that's how you remember it's about

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's how you remember it's about
temperature<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> word<00:01:07.020> coolant<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
temperature and the word coolant then we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
temperature and the word coolant then we
go<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.569> side<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.890> container<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
go down to the side of the container and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.059 
go down to the side of the container and
you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> line<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.679> coolant

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.069 
you can see a line here the coolant

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.710 
you can see a line here the coolant
should<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.280> filled<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.970> line<00:01:15.209> that's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
should be filled up to that line that's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.169 
should be filled up to that line that's
as<00:01:15.869> simple<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> answer<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.800> be<00:01:17.179> don't

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
as simple as the answer can be don't

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.660 
as simple as the answer can be don't
complicate<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 

next<00:01:24.060> question<00:01:24.450> identify<00:01:25.140> where<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
next question identify where the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.740 
next question identify where the
windscreen<00:01:26.160> washer<00:01:26.310> reservoir<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.390> tell

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
windscreen washer reservoir is and tell

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.910 
windscreen washer reservoir is and tell
me<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.050> will<00:01:28.260> check<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.620> windscreen

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
me how you will check the windscreen

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.640 
me how you will check the windscreen
washer<00:01:29.250> level<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.530> I'm

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
washer level so this is the one that I'm

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.080 
washer level so this is the one that I'm
pointing<00:01:31.830> out<00:01:32.130> here

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
pointing out here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.330 
pointing out here
this<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.390> identified<00:01:36.260> by<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:36.860> funny-looking

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
this is identified by this funny-looking

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
this is identified by this funny-looking
symbol<00:01:38.150> it's<00:01:38.390> men<00:01:38.570> represent<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> windscreen

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
symbol it's men represent the windscreen

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.340 
symbol it's men represent the windscreen
and<00:01:40.000> something<00:01:41.000> spraying<00:01:41.630> up<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.900> top<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.230> it

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and something spraying up on top of it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.210 
and something spraying up on top of it
so<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.920> can<00:01:42.950> make<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.760> what<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:44.000> will

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
so you can make of that what you will

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.440 
so you can make of that what you will
next<00:01:46.220> we<00:01:46.370> have<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.580> figure<00:01:46.820> out<00:01:46.940> how<00:01:47.120> we<00:01:47.180> can

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
next we have to figure out how we can

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.660 
next we have to figure out how we can
see<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.990> level<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.440> on<00:01:48.950> most<00:01:49.130> cars<00:01:49.430> it's

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
see the level and on most cars it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.400 
see the level and on most cars it's
see-through<00:01:50.240> container<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.230> can

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
see-through container so you can

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.710 
see-through container so you can
actually<00:01:51.530> see<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.100> level<00:01:52.660> inside<00:01:53.660> the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
actually see the level inside the

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.750 
actually see the level inside the

next question open the bonnet identify
where<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.480> would<00:02:04.600> check<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.020> oil<00:02:05.050> level<00:02:05.290> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
where you would check the oil level and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.800 
where you would check the oil level and
tell<00:02:06.610> me<00:02:06.760> how<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:06.970> would<00:02:07.210> check<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.720> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810

this thing that I'm pointing at down
here<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.610> called<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.000> dipstick<00:02:22.330> believe<00:02:22.780> it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
here is called the dipstick believe it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.360 
here is called the dipstick believe it
or<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.380> that's<00:02:23.560> what<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.860> use<00:02:23.890> to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
or not and that's what you use to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.840 
or not and that's what you use to
actually<00:02:24.640> measure<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.330> level<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.690> oil<00:02:26.850> what

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
actually measure the level of oil what

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.520 
actually measure the level of oil what
we<00:02:27.940> need<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.270> now<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.540> pull<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.990> dipstick

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
we need to do now is pull this dipstick

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.490 
we need to do now is pull this dipstick
out<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:31.000> quite<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.210> long<00:02:31.510> piece<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.870> metal<00:02:32.350> so

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
out it's quite a long piece of metal so

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.620 
out it's quite a long piece of metal so
to<00:02:33.160> pull<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.730> thing<00:02:33.910> all<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> way<00:02:34.300> out<00:02:34.450> as

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
to pull that thing all the way out as

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.030 
to pull that thing all the way out as
we've<00:02:34.930> been<00:02:35.020> driving<00:02:35.260> around<00:02:35.500> there's<00:02:35.920> lots

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
we've been driving around there's lots

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.650 
we've been driving around there's lots
of<00:02:36.130> oil<00:02:36.280> splashed<00:02:36.700> around<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.390> we<00:02:37.480> can't

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
of oil splashed around on it so we can't

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.510 
of oil splashed around on it so we can't
get<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.840> good<00:02:37.990> measurement<00:02:38.140> until<00:02:38.830> we<00:02:39.280> clean<00:02:39.490> it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
get a good measurement until we clean it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.970 
get a good measurement until we clean it
so<00:02:40.210> use<00:02:40.660> piece<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.990> tissue<00:02:41.170> make<00:02:41.680> sure<00:02:41.800> that's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
so use piece of tissue make sure that's

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.830 
so use piece of tissue make sure that's
all<00:02:42.220> cleaned<00:02:42.520> off

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.640 

now<00:02:47.590> if<00:02:47.709> we<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> closer<00:02:48.250> look

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
now if we have a closer look

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.929 
now if we have a closer look
be<00:02:48.739> able<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> see<00:02:49.159> on<00:02:49.280> top<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.700> there's<00:02:49.849> a

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
be able to see on top that there's a

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.720 
be able to see on top that there's a
maximum<00:02:50.510> mark<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.470> minimum<00:02:51.920> mark<00:02:52.189> we<00:02:52.489> want

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
maximum mark and a minimum mark we want

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.160 
maximum mark and a minimum mark we want
the<00:02:52.819> oil<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.150> between<00:02:53.480> these<00:02:53.750> two<00:02:53.810> when<00:02:54.140> we

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
the oil to be between these two when we

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.270 
the oil to be between these two when we
take<00:02:54.379> our<00:02:54.560> measurement

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.369 

so<00:02:59.280> we<00:02:59.519> put<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.329> dipstick<00:03:00.510> back<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.079> make<00:03:01.349> sure

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
so we put the dipstick back in make sure

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.440 
so we put the dipstick back in make sure
it<00:03:01.739> goes<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> way<00:03:02.609> down<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.150> properly

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
it goes all the way down and properly

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.179 
it goes all the way down and properly
engages<00:03:03.989> no<00:03:04.230> good<00:03:04.379> putting<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.680> halfway<00:03:05.040> in

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
engages no good putting it halfway in

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.240 
engages no good putting it halfway in
and<00:03:05.900> when<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.989> pull<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> out<00:03:07.379> you're<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.189> to

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and when you pull it out you're going to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.759 
and when you pull it out you're going to
find<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.640> somewhere<00:03:09.299> halfway<00:03:10.109> up<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.560> is

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
find that somewhere halfway up there is

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.580 
find that somewhere halfway up there is
our<00:03:11.760> level<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.659> that's<00:03:12.870> exactly<00:03:13.349> what<00:03:13.469> we

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
our level and that's exactly what we

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.199 
our level and that's exactly what we
want<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.829> see<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.129> between<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.640> maximum<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
want to see it's between the maximum and

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.509 
want to see it's between the maximum and
the<00:03:15.269> minimum<00:03:15.359> marks<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.019> we<00:03:16.079> saw<00:03:16.260> before<00:03:16.519> if

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
the minimum marks that we saw before if

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.610 
the minimum marks that we saw before if
there's<00:03:18.329> not<00:03:18.420> enough<00:03:18.480> all<00:03:19.049> you've<00:03:19.260> got<00:03:19.379> to<00:03:19.500> do

there's not enough all you've got to do

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.619 
there's not enough all you've got to do
is<00:03:19.890> fill<00:03:20.430> some<00:03:20.640> up<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.090> filler<00:03:21.299> cap<00:03:21.480> that

cars<00:03:54.070> you'll<00:03:54.640> see<00:03:54.970> max<00:03:55.840> printed<00:03:56.740> there<00:03:57.010> and

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
cars you'll see max printed there and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.730 
cars you'll see max printed there and
just<00:03:58.330> out<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.570> shot<00:03:58.959> underneath<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.530> you

just out a shot underneath that you

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.520 
just out a shot underneath that you
would<00:03:59.920> see<00:04:00.190> min<00:04:00.880> or<00:04:01.239> minimum<00:04:01.810> printed<00:04:02.290> so

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
would see min or minimum printed so

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.809 
would see min or minimum printed so
pretty<00:04:02.860> obvious<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.400> should<00:04:03.580> be<00:04:03.670> between

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
pretty obvious that it should be between

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.690 
pretty obvious that it should be between
those<00:04:04.120> two<00:04:04.390> levels<00:04:04.750> very<00:04:05.380> easy

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
those two levels very easy

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.280 
those two levels very easy
