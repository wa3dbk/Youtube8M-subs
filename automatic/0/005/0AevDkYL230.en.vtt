00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
to draw classic sonic you start with his

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.670 
to draw classic sonic you start with his
mouthpiece<00:00:06.299> which<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> basically<00:00:07.319> three

circles<00:00:08.099> together<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:09.210> form<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.630> makes

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
circles together in a form that makes

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.020 
circles together in a form that makes
like<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> watermelon<00:00:10.679> slice<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
like a watermelon slice and in the

like a watermelon slice and in the
middle<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.450> no<00:00:12.719> size<00:00:13.290> mouth<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
middle of no size mouth you have the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.900 
middle of no size mouth you have the
nose<00:00:15.240> which<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.630> an<00:00:15.780> oval<00:00:16.020> colored<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> fully

his eyes are basically two ovals
connected<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> triangle<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.990> I<00:00:24.990> had<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
connected with a triangle and I had to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.050 
connected with a triangle and I had to
redraw<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.460> messed<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
redraw this because I messed up on that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.529 
redraw this because I messed up on that
one<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.980> just<00:00:28.980> took<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.279> thousand<00:00:29.970> tries<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
one and just took a thousand tries to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.350 
one and just took a thousand tries to
redraw<00:00:30.869> when<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> film<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.340> harder<00:00:32.669> drop<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
redraw when I film it's harder drop I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.160 
redraw when I film it's harder drop I
don't<00:00:33.780> know<00:00:33.870> why<00:00:35.420> but<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.600> we'll<00:00:36.809> start<00:00:37.020> with

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
don't know why but now we'll start with

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
don't know why but now we'll start with
his<00:00:37.290> pupils<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.640> ovals

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
his pupils which are two ovals

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
his pupils which are two ovals
you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> place<00:00:40.320> them<00:00:40.469> anywhere<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.250> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
you can place them anywhere you want but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
you can place them anywhere you want but
I<00:00:41.550> place<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.300> he'll<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> looking<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
I place them so he'll be looking at you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.639 
I place them so he'll be looking at you
basically<00:00:48.020> inside<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> draw<00:00:49.620> another

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
basically inside of it you draw another

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.910 
basically inside of it you draw another
circle<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:50.789> color<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:53.989> magic<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
circle and then color it in magic is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
circle and then color it in magic is
mouth<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.329> smile<00:00:59.780> I'm<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
mouth which is the smile I'm going to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
mouth which is the smile I'm going to
fix<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> eyes<00:01:01.530> later<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> feel<00:01:02.730> the

fix the eyes later on this and feel the
right<00:01:03.030> foot<00:01:03.300> anyway<00:01:03.719> back<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.439> ran

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
right foot anyway back to this you ran

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
right foot anyway back to this you ran
off<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.129> no<00:01:05.220> lefty<00:01:05.729> kids<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.540> two

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
off or no lefty kids and then your two

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
off or no lefty kids and then your two
triangles<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.439> 30<00:01:07.619> years<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.159> another

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
triangles with 30 years and another

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850 
triangles with 30 years and another
triangle<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> side<00:01:09.600> bow<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.590> ears

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
triangle in side bow to them the ears

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
triangle in side bow to them the ears
will<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.490> top<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> eyes<00:01:12.210> basically<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
will be on top of the eyes basically and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
will be on top of the eyes basically and
then<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> end<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> left<00:01:14.670> triangle<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
then at the end of the left triangle you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
then at the end of the left triangle you
round<00:01:15.689> off<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.259> three<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.680> triangles

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
round off and make three more triangles

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
round off and make three more triangles
and<00:01:17.310> connecting<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> end<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.479> your

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and connecting it at the end of your

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.490 
and connecting it at the end of your
right<00:01:18.840> cheek<00:01:20.570> where<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> ends<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.350> run

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
right cheek where that ends you can run

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.749 
right cheek where that ends you can run
again<00:01:22.860> basically<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> noodle<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:25.759> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
again basically like a noodle or the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.760 
again basically like a noodle or the
part<00:01:27.030> where<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> hold<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.509> cup<00:01:27.720> or<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> mug<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.590> an

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
part where you hold a cup or a mug at an

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
part where you hold a cup or a mug at an
or<00:01:28.890> desk<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.610> handle<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
or desk all right now handle and at the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749 
or desk all right now handle and at the
end<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> draw<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> black<00:01:32.220> hole<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
end it out you draw a black hole and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
end it out you draw a black hole and
it's<00:01:33.090> basically<00:01:33.450> two<00:01:33.720> old<00:01:34.049> ovals<00:01:34.710> combined

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it's basically two old ovals combined

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
it's basically two old ovals combined
his<00:01:35.670> hands<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.450> circles

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
his hands like circles

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.460 
his hands like circles
I<00:01:38.090> can't<00:01:39.090> let<00:01:39.180> describe<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I can't let describe it this like a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.399 
I can't let describe it this like a
square<00:01:40.860> circle<00:01:41.490> thing<00:01:41.939> his<00:01:42.840> body

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
square circle thing his body

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.300 
square circle thing his body
it<00:01:43.590> connects<00:01:43.979> his<00:01:45.079> mouth<00:01:46.079> park<00:01:46.439> his<00:01:46.829> hand<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it connects his mouth park his hand so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
it connects his mouth park his hand so
this<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> circle<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.570> think

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
this is circle and then you think

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.990 
this is circle and then you think
Spike's<00:01:49.470> behind<00:01:49.950> him<00:01:50.130> which<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.670> triangle

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
Spike's behind him which is one triangle

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.800 
Spike's behind him which is one triangle
with<00:01:51.450> his<00:01:51.600> tail<00:01:51.840> which<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> another<00:01:52.500> triangle

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
with his tail which is another triangle

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.469 
with his tail which is another triangle
and<00:01:53.900> his<00:01:54.560> body<00:01:54.920> has<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.430> little<00:01:55.790> tiny<00:01:55.970> circle

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
and his body has a little tiny circle

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.170 
and his body has a little tiny circle
inside<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.140> for<00:01:57.619> his<00:01:57.770> belly<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.250> I'm

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
inside of it for his belly and I'm

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.670 
inside of it for his belly and I'm
fixing<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.750> spikes<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.229> wasn't<00:02:00.560> too<00:02:00.650> happy

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
fixing the spikes I wasn't too happy

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.070 
fixing the spikes I wasn't too happy
when<00:02:01.130> he<00:02:01.280> came<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.479> wanted<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.810> be<00:02:02.930> that

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
when he came on I just wanted to be that
