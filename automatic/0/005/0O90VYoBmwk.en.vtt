modification<00:01:35.049> these<00:01:36.049> pulleys<00:01:36.799> here<00:01:37.460> were

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
modification these pulleys here were

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.190 
modification these pulleys here were
purchased<00:01:39.079> at<00:01:39.350> Grainger<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:41.079> they're<00:01:42.079> about

and<00:02:01.759> this<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.569> one<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.590> pulleys

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
and this this is one of the pulleys

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.169 
and this this is one of the pulleys
purchased<00:02:04.399> at<00:02:04.549> Lowe's

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
purchased at Lowe's

this<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.959> single<00:02:06.259> turnbuckle<00:02:08.470> purchase

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
this is the single turnbuckle purchase

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.300 
this is the single turnbuckle purchase
it<00:02:09.619> Lowe's<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.329> of<00:02:11.329> course<00:02:11.599> each<00:02:11.900> side<00:02:12.319> has

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
it Lowe's and of course each side has

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.960 
it Lowe's and of course each side has
their<00:02:14.120> own<00:02:14.150> its<00:02:14.599> own<00:02:14.840> separate<00:02:15.260> cable<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.910> is

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
their own its own separate cable this is

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.680 
their own its own separate cable this is
this<00:02:20.299> has<00:02:20.480> really<00:02:20.660> been<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:22.239> good<00:02:23.239> part<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.599> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
this has really been a good part of the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.390 
this has really been a good part of the
modification<00:02:24.549> also<00:02:26.260> putting<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.709> separators

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
modification also putting the separators

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.190 
modification also putting the separators
I<00:02:28.610> had<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.180> one<00:02:29.360> originally<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> first

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
I had this one originally on the first

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.100 
I had this one originally on the first
one<00:02:30.470> but<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.340> put<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.849> one<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.780> one<00:02:32.989> on

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
one but I put this one on this one on

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.229 
one but I put this one on this one on
this<00:02:33.319> end<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.829> also<00:02:34.579> if<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.940> look<00:02:35.060> at<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
this end and also if you look at the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.970 
this end and also if you look at the
bottom<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.019> also<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.769> two<00:02:36.950> on

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
bottom one of that is also it's two on

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.210 
bottom one of that is also it's two on
this<00:02:37.280> side<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.209> non<00:02:38.450> handle<00:02:38.989> side<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
this side the non handle side and on the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.910 
this side the non handle side and on the
handle<00:02:40.670> side<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.810> notice<00:02:42.170> there<00:02:42.739> are

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
handle side if you notice there are

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.819 
handle side if you notice there are
three<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.760> actually<00:02:44.389> there<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.829> there

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
three of that actually there are there

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.190 
three of that actually there are there
are<00:02:46.040> no<00:02:46.579> two<00:02:46.639> again<00:02:47.120> because<00:02:47.569> see<00:02:47.780> actually

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
are no two again because see actually

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.580 
are no two again because see actually
this<00:02:48.319> represents<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.750> does<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.200> bottom

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
this represents as it does on the bottom

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.280 
this represents as it does on the bottom
so<00:02:51.889> it's<00:02:52.040> two<00:02:52.310> accidents<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:53.359> is<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.870> good

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
so it's two accidents this is this good

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.660 
so it's two accidents this is this good
you<00:02:54.380> could<00:02:54.530> probably<00:02:54.709> do<00:02:54.980> without<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.489> one

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you could probably do without this one

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.449 
you could probably do without this one
over<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.840> did<00:02:57.109> put<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.500> keep<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.889> so

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
over here but I did put it to keep it so

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.879 
over here but I did put it to keep it so
it<00:02:58.549> would<00:02:58.670> stay<00:02:58.850> lined<00:02:59.150> up<00:02:59.389> it<00:03:00.049> does<00:03:00.350> move<00:03:00.620> much

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
it would stay lined up it does move much

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.220 
it would stay lined up it does move much
better<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.370> does<00:03:01.519> not<00:03:01.670> bind<00:03:02.030> if<00:03:02.810> wrapped

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
better and does not bind if wrapped

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.229 
better and does not bind if wrapped
properly<00:03:03.829> if<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.609> cables<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.060> wrapped

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
properly if the cables are wrapped

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.490 
properly if the cables are wrapped
around<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:06.049> cylinders<00:03:06.470> properly<00:03:11.319> back<00:03:12.319> to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
around the cylinders properly back to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.360 
around the cylinders properly back to
where<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:12.739> started<00:03:12.769> from

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.610 

now<00:03:20.370> I'm<00:03:20.670> going<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> insert<00:03:21.630> the

now I'm going to insert the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.960 
now I'm going to insert the

piece of plywood I have varnish I did
cut<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.820> hole<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.450> one<00:03:33.690> side<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.100> can<00:03:35.280> be

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
cut a hole in one side so it can be

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.550 
cut a hole in one side so it can be
easily<00:03:35.580> grabbed<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.360> removed<00:03:36.720> otherwise<00:03:37.080> you

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
easily grabbed and removed otherwise you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.440 
easily grabbed and removed otherwise you
have<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.680> push<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:37.890> from<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> bottom<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:39.330> it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
have to push it from the bottom so it

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:50.090 
have to push it from the bottom so it
fits<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:40.760> like<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.470> drops<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:50.010> and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
fits in here like so and drops in and

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.970 
fits in here like so and drops in and
provides<00:03:50.580> your<00:03:51.330> table<00:03:52.220> base<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.520> table<00:03:54.980> you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
provides your table base your table you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.660 
provides your table base your table you
can<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.970> point<00:03:57.830> flatten<00:03:58.830> your<00:03:59.220> clay<00:03:59.610> to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
can at this point flatten your clay to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.030 
can at this point flatten your clay to
this<00:04:00.000> depth<00:04:00.390> right<00:04:00.600> here<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.440> guess

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
this depth right here I guess

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.970 
this depth right here I guess
approximately<00:04:02.790> 3/4<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.720> 7/8<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.350> an<00:04:04.470> inch<00:04:04.680> or

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
approximately 3/4 to 7/8 of an inch or

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.810 
approximately 3/4 to 7/8 of an inch or
you<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:05.940> add<00:04:06.120> spacers<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.190> add<00:04:08.370> spacers

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
you can add spacers you can add spacers

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.190 
you can add spacers you can add spacers
in<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.300> form<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.980> quarter<00:04:10.980> inch<00:04:11.160> plywood

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
in the form of quarter inch plywood

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.420 
in the form of quarter inch plywood
inexpensive<00:04:13.200> plywood<00:04:13.620> which<00:04:13.770> works<00:04:14.070> very

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
inexpensive plywood which works very

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.509 
inexpensive plywood which works very
well<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:16.380> can<00:04:16.440> cut<00:04:16.739> two<00:04:16.950> or<00:04:16.980> three<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.370> those

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
well you can cut two or three of those

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.270 
well you can cut two or three of those
and<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:18.330> you<00:04:18.450> can<00:04:18.660> find<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.200> 1/8<00:04:19.680> inch<00:04:19.950> plywood

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and if you can find it 1/8 inch plywood

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.620 
and if you can find it 1/8 inch plywood
which<00:04:20.820> works<00:04:21.060> very<00:04:21.359> good<00:04:21.660> I've<00:04:22.410> used<00:04:23.630> several

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
which works very good I've used several

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.500 
which works very good I've used several
things<00:04:25.050> plywood<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:26.130> also<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.580> this<00:04:26.790> poly

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
things plywood but also have this poly

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.050 
things plywood but also have this poly
ethyl<00:04:27.840> polyethylene<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.550> shoots<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.000> I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
ethyl polyethylene the shoots that I

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.080 
ethyl polyethylene the shoots that I
have<00:04:30.210> from<00:04:30.360> another<00:04:30.690> job<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:32.040> need<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.760> simply

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
have from another job I need to simply

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.750 
have from another job I need to simply
slip<00:04:33.330> in<00:04:33.510> here<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.490> performance<00:04:35.490> according

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
slip in here and performance according

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.880 
slip in here and performance according
to<00:04:35.940> stick<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.390> it<00:04:36.900> raises<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.380> table<00:04:37.770> up

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
to stick and it raises the table up

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.310 
to stick and it raises the table up
basically<00:04:38.280> on<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:39.030> base<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.660> quarter<00:04:40.140> and

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
basically on the base of a quarter and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.800 
basically on the base of a quarter and
then<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.100> can<00:04:41.280> put<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.580> not<00:04:41.760> only<00:04:42.060> if<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.240> want<00:04:42.570> to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
then I can put in not only if I want to

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.110 
then I can put in not only if I want to
and<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.710> raises<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.160> up<00:04:44.250> another<00:04:47.120> another

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
and that raises it up another another

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.400 
and that raises it up another another
quarter<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.340> even<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:51.110> 1/16<00:04:52.110> inch

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
quarter and I even have a 1/16 inch

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.880 
quarter and I even have a 1/16 inch
piece<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.710> plastic<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.060> use<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.620> rate

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
piece of plastic that I use and I rate

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.680 
piece of plastic that I use and I rate
and<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.640> of<00:04:56.820> course<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.150> raises<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.600> up

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
and and and of course it raises it up

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.409 
and and and of course it raises it up
even<00:04:58.020> more<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.440> this<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.130> estimated<00:04:59.940> about<00:05:00.120> a

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
even more and this is estimated about a

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.780 
even more and this is estimated about a
quarter<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.900> an<00:05:01.020> inch<00:05:01.140> so<00:05:01.890> by<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.160> time<00:05:02.520> you

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
quarter of an inch so by the time you

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
quarter of an inch so by the time you
you<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:05.220> put<00:05:05.460> your<00:05:05.669> spacers<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.360> there<00:05:06.600> and

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
you you put your spacers in there and

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.070 
you you put your spacers in there and
then<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.770> take<00:05:08.460> your<00:05:08.490> your<00:05:09.090> cloth<00:05:09.419> your

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
then you take your your cloth your

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.900 
then you take your your cloth your
canvas<00:05:10.590> cloth<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:12.020> put<00:05:13.020> your<00:05:13.370> clay<00:05:14.370> in<00:05:14.430> here

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
canvas cloth and put your clay in here

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.520 
canvas cloth and put your clay in here
and<00:05:15.060> then<00:05:15.450> flatten<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.500> or<00:05:16.710> roll<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:18.530> ends

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
and then flatten it or roll it it ends

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.800 
and then flatten it or roll it it ends
up<00:05:19.620> being<00:05:19.890> probably<00:05:21.980> 3/16<00:05:22.980> of<00:05:23.160> an<00:05:23.280> inch<00:05:23.400> thick

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
up being probably 3/16 of an inch thick

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.930 
up being probably 3/16 of an inch thick
so<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:24.840> can<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.979> can<00:05:26.160> play<00:05:26.310> around<00:05:26.610> with<00:05:26.760> that

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
so you can you can play around with that

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.490 
so you can you can play around with that
and<00:05:27.180> find<00:05:27.660> what<00:05:27.870> works

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
and find what works

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.550 
and find what works
for<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.540> basically<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.260> only

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
for you and that is basically the only

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.110 
for you and that is basically the only
thing<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:35.070> I'm<00:05:35.220> going<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.490> do<00:05:35.640> differently

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
thing that I'm going to do differently

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.280 
thing that I'm going to do differently
is<00:05:36.720> on<00:05:37.710> my<00:05:37.860> canvas<00:05:38.190> material<00:05:38.940> I'm<00:05:39.060> gonna<00:05:39.300> buy<00:05:40.260> a

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
is on my canvas material I'm gonna buy a

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.730 
is on my canvas material I'm gonna buy a
new<00:05:40.650> piece<00:05:40.950> and<00:05:41.760> I'm<00:05:42.630> going<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:42.990> seam<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.380> on

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
new piece and I'm going to seam it on

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.950 
new piece and I'm going to seam it on
all<00:05:43.950> four<00:05:44.280> sides<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:44.910> I<00:05:44.940> have<00:05:45.150> no<00:05:45.330> graveling

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
all four sides so I have no graveling

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.150 
all four sides so I have no graveling
like<00:05:46.710> this<00:05:47.040> of<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.940> other<00:05:48.180> family<00:05:48.950> but<00:05:49.950> that's

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
like this of the other family but that's

00:05:50.160 --> 00:06:07.100 
like this of the other family but that's
basically<00:05:50.550> it

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.260 

one<00:06:07.680> more<00:06:07.919> important<00:06:08.370> thing<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.789> understand

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
one more important thing to understand

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.070 
one more important thing to understand
is<00:06:09.449> that<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:11.190> cables<00:06:11.729> are<00:06:12.080> different

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
is that the cables are different

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.820 
is that the cables are different
distances<00:06:13.770> from<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.789> side<00:06:15.090> rail<00:06:15.509> and<00:06:15.840> there

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
distances from the side rail and there

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.480 
distances from the side rail and there
that<00:06:17.310> determines<00:06:18.000> by<00:06:19.009> where<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:22.490> cables

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
that determines by where the cables

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.529 
that determines by where the cables
actually<00:06:24.680> start<00:06:25.680> and<00:06:26.509> end<00:06:27.509> up<00:06:27.889> in<00:06:29.539> winding

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
actually start and end up in winding

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.800 
actually start and end up in winding
this<00:06:30.780> cable<00:06:31.349> around<00:06:31.650> here<00:06:32.210> we<00:06:33.210> started<00:06:33.629> from

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
this cable around here we started from

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.230 
this cable around here we started from
the<00:06:34.169> ferrule<00:06:34.949> which<00:06:35.099> is<00:06:35.280> permanently<00:06:35.759> fixed

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
the ferrule which is permanently fixed

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.770 
the ferrule which is permanently fixed
and<00:06:36.389> came<00:06:37.319> across<00:06:39.020> under<00:06:40.020> the<00:06:40.229> top<00:06:40.560> cylinder

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
and came across under the top cylinder

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.570 
and came across under the top cylinder
around<00:06:42.780> and<00:06:44.360> then<00:06:45.360> to<00:06:46.319> the<00:06:46.469> bottom<00:06:46.949> cylinder

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
around and then to the bottom cylinder

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.459 
around and then to the bottom cylinder
down<00:06:48.030> here<00:06:48.770> around<00:06:49.770> one<00:06:50.400> time<00:06:50.699> not<00:06:51.150> twice<00:06:51.509> back

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
down here around one time not twice back

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:57.110 
down here around one time not twice back
up<00:06:53.120> around<00:06:54.120> and<00:06:54.810> then<00:06:55.530> back<00:06:55.770> through<00:06:56.120> here

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
up around and then back through here

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.659 
up around and then back through here
through<00:06:57.599> the<00:06:57.780> pulley<00:06:58.050> down<00:06:59.009> to<00:06:59.310> the<00:06:59.430> pulley

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
through the pulley down to the pulley

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.809 
through the pulley down to the pulley
over<00:07:00.030> here<00:07:00.379> down<00:07:01.379> to<00:07:01.590> the<00:07:01.830> bottom<00:07:01.860> fully<00:07:02.490> and

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 
over here down to the bottom fully and

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.020 
over here down to the bottom fully and
through<00:07:03.240> and<00:07:03.479> then<00:07:04.199> through<00:07:04.650> here<00:07:05.099> and<00:07:05.250> once

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
through and then through here and once

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.909 
through and then through here and once
again<00:07:06.180> that<00:07:06.449> distance<00:07:07.020> from<00:07:07.139> the<00:07:07.289> side<00:07:07.560> rail

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 
again that distance from the side rail

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:13.059 
again that distance from the side rail
to<00:07:07.949> here<00:07:08.430> is<00:07:08.840> determined<00:07:09.840> by<00:07:10.580> where<00:07:11.580> this

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069 
to here is determined by where this

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.290 
to here is determined by where this
particular<00:07:14.069> separator<00:07:14.849> ring<00:07:15.090> this<00:07:15.240> ring

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
particular separator ring this ring

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.269 
particular separator ring this ring
separator<00:07:16.110> is<00:07:16.440> so<00:07:17.370> we<00:07:17.610> came<00:07:17.819> out<00:07:18.979> hope<00:07:19.979> you<00:07:20.130> can

the way to the other side over here and
then<00:07:43.710> tightened<00:07:44.279> and<00:07:44.430> tighten<00:07:45.419> the<00:07:45.509> clip<00:07:47.029> it's

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:48.029 
then tightened and tighten the clip it's

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:50.959 
then tightened and tighten the clip it's
really<00:07:48.509> simple<00:07:48.830> tried<00:07:49.830> several<00:07:50.250> times<00:07:50.430> you're

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:50.969 
really simple tried several times you're

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:55.879 
really simple tried several times you're
confused<00:07:52.219> it<00:07:53.219> really<00:07:54.120> starts<00:07:54.750> from<00:07:54.990> the<00:07:55.590> very

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:55.889 
confused it really starts from the very

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.900 
confused it really starts from the very
top<00:07:56.219> and<00:07:56.490> ends<00:07:57.210> on<00:07:57.360> the<00:07:57.479> bottom
