00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.420
 kick has a triple objective in the first 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.520
 approaching the world of the university 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.110
 and the company so that the jump of a 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.600
 site to another is not very different for 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.520
 the boys the second goal is good 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.039
 publicize the signature and that the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.540
 students perceive us as a site 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.190
 where they develop their professional career 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.260
 and third of course 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.520
 identify talent will identify 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.289
 those students who have a 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 profile that adapts to our 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.320
 needs people with a lot of restlessness 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.749
 for the international issue wanting to 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.429
 face challenges that in the end is what 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.879
 that what they have to do along 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.879
 of the cooker 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 that make this this type of contests me 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.960
 it seems to me it seems great because I think 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.850
 that can help us too 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.489
 I help them and even for 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.710
 recruit people or to know how they are 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 the students who are going to go out later to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.089
 working world the participants always 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.790
 this year all previous years 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.920
 they come very nervous in the end that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.340
 they have to be put in front of partners 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.289
 the signature that already imposes a little have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 what to do the presentation in English 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.110
 is the mother tongue in most 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 the cases although they speak it phenomenal 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.039
 It is not the same and that's good 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.550
 It is always a small obstacle that they have 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.550
 what to overcome 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.200
 the experience has been to jump to the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.119
 reality first what I want is 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.750
 Almelo good fun to learn 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.159
 maximum and of course win and past my 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.429
 expectation is that it is an experience 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.860
 different really we can 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.299
 respond to a very high demand and in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.369
 a very short time also do it in 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.490
 English I think that it is always 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.679
 a good preparation for things that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.450
 can come the future isolate chickens 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.210
 of the world no doubt firm note I said 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.090
 good that finishing the race I will have to 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.830
 try once you are verbier we are 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.470
 impressed because the teams are leaving 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.030
 improving year after year this year the case 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.929
 it was not easy it was a pretty 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.209
 complex 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.069
 in fact the judges when we read it not 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.890
 We had our doubts about how 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.660
 focus it and we were surprised to get to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.040
 the experience of hong kong is going to be the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.650
 best experience we can have in 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.450
 a good business of this kind I think that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.390
 it's an opportunity to compete with 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.920
 very good equipment from all over the world and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.030
 I think it's going to be an opportunity to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 demonstrate what we are worth
