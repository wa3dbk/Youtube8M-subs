think<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.290> beer<00:02:45.590> might<00:02:45.829> have<00:02:45.920> been<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> little

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
think this beer might have been a little

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.009 
think this beer might have been a little
bit<00:02:46.459> ahead<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.700> its<00:02:46.880> time<00:02:46.970> again<00:02:47.660> they

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
bit ahead of its time again they

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.750 
bit ahead of its time again they
released<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.560> beer<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.799> couple<00:02:49.250> years<00:02:49.459> ago<00:02:49.549> I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
released this beer a couple years ago I

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.580 
released this beer a couple years ago I
don't<00:02:50.239> know<00:02:50.359> how<00:02:50.480> well<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:50.750> sold<00:02:51.200> but<00:02:51.500> they

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
don't know how well it's sold but they

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.110 
don't know how well it's sold but they
decided<00:02:51.739> not<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.370> release<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.000> few

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
decided not to release it for a few

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.210 
decided not to release it for a few
years<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.660> think<00:02:54.079> due<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.290> production<00:02:54.560> issues

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
years I think due to production issues

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.610 
years I think due to production issues
and<00:02:55.549> they<00:02:55.940> were<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.209> at<00:02:56.480> capacity<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.470> now

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and they were just at capacity so now

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.979 
and they were just at capacity so now
that<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:58.850> know<00:02:58.880> they're<00:02:59.150> able<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.569> produce<00:02:59.720> it

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
that you know they're able to produce it

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.300 
that you know they're able to produce it
again<00:03:00.200> at<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.470> new<00:03:00.590> brewery<00:03:00.950> at<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.130> bigger

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
again at the new brewery at the bigger

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.729 
again at the new brewery at the bigger
facility<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.750> think<00:03:02.989> Brett<00:03:03.260> beers<00:03:03.530> are

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
facility and I think Brett beers are

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.199 
facility and I think Brett beers are
kind<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:03.980> in<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.220> forefront<00:03:04.609> bread<00:03:04.910> IPA

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
kind of in the forefront bread IPA

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.819 
kind of in the forefront bread IPA
they're<00:03:05.540> kind<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> an<00:03:05.840> upcoming<00:03:06.079> style<00:03:06.620> I

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
they're kind of an upcoming style I

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.530 
they're kind of an upcoming style I
think<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.400> time<00:03:07.609> for<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.910> beer<00:03:08.150> it's
