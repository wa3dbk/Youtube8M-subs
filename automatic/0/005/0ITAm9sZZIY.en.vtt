this winter Todd okay you know I really

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.900 
this winter Todd okay you know I really
think<00:00:07.500> you're<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.220> hear<00:00:08.309> more<00:00:08.550> about<00:00:08.610> on

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
think you're going to hear more about on

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.900 
think you're going to hear more about on
Saturday<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.110> see<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.010> upper<00:00:11.309> eyelid<00:00:11.700> in

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
Saturday how I see the upper eyelid in

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.239 
Saturday how I see the upper eyelid in
terms<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.299> bone<00:00:12.450> caucasian<00:00:13.169> and<00:00:13.259> asian<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:14.219> i

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
terms of bone caucasian and asian but i

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.220 
terms of bone caucasian and asian but i
think<00:00:14.519> we're<00:00:14.820> looking<00:00:14.849> today<00:00:15.570> more<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.200> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
think we're looking today more for a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.590 
think we're looking today more for a
lower<00:00:16.590> fuller<00:00:17.070> brow<00:00:17.430> which<00:00:17.940> may<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.150> sort<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
lower fuller brow which may be sort of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
lower fuller brow which may be sort of
the<00:00:18.720> antithesis<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.530> you've<00:00:19.800> heard<00:00:19.980> this

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the antithesis of what you've heard this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
the antithesis of what you've heard this
morning<00:00:20.570> it's<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.780> different<00:00:21.930> philosophy

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
morning it's just a different philosophy

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
morning it's just a different philosophy
in<00:00:22.530> a<00:00:22.620> different<00:00:22.890> approach<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:24.150> you're

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
in a different approach what you're

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
in a different approach what you're
going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> hear<00:00:24.510> during<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.080> talk<00:00:25.440> is<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
going to hear during this talk is what I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.190 
going to hear during this talk is what I
believe<00:00:26.340> would<00:00:27.030> be<00:00:27.150> helpful<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.600> both<00:00:27.810> people

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
believe would be helpful for both people

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.560 
believe would be helpful for both people
that<00:00:28.530> don't<00:00:29.070> perform<00:00:29.280> Asian<00:00:29.910> eyelids<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.390> well

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that don't perform Asian eyelids as well

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.030 
that don't perform Asian eyelids as well
as<00:00:30.720> those<00:00:30.930> that<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:31.800> sort<00:00:31.950> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
as those that do so I'm going to sort of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
as those that do so I'm going to sort of
divide<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> talk<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.719> we'll<00:00:33.809> get

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
divide the talk and I think we'll get

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.090 
divide the talk and I think we'll get
you<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.410> troubles<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.890> I've

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
you out as in troubles that I've

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.209 
you out as in troubles that I've
encountered<00:00:35.929> so<00:00:36.929> what<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.589> a<00:00:37.620> beautiful

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
encountered so what is a beautiful

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.799 
encountered so what is a beautiful
eyelid<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.670> Asian<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.749> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
eyelid in Asian well I think it's very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
eyelid in Asian well I think it's very
similar<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> Caucasian<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.100> many<00:00:41.280> respects

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
similar to a Caucasian in many respects

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.329 
similar to a Caucasian in many respects
it's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.210> very<00:00:42.420> low<00:00:42.749> full<00:00:43.199> I<00:00:43.409> with<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> very<00:00:44.039> low

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
it's a very low full I with a very low

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.239 
it's a very low full I with a very low
crease<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.589> see<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.219> well

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
crease and you can see that here as well

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:49.489 
crease and you can see that here as well
I<00:00:47.699> think<00:00:48.179> a<00:00:48.449> lo<00:00:48.600> crees<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.019> also<00:00:49.319> more

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
I think a lo crees is also more

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.069 
I think a lo crees is also more
attractive<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> Caucasian<00:00:50.929> so<00:00:51.929> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
attractive at the Caucasian so the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
attractive at the Caucasian so the
anatomy<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> quick<00:00:53.039> resident<00:00:53.609> review

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
anatomy just as a quick resident review

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
anatomy just as a quick resident review
essentially<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.690> happens<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.409> some<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
essentially what happens in some of the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.110 
essentially what happens in some of the
Asian<00:00:56.190> eyelids<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.089> no

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Asian eyelids is that there is no

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
Asian eyelids is that there is no
insertion<00:00:58.050> point<00:00:58.499> for<00:00:59.249> the<00:00:59.989> elevator<00:01:00.989> into

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
insertion point for the elevator into

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.919 
insertion point for the elevator into
the<00:01:01.469> dermis<00:01:01.679> so<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> PO<00:01:03.300> septal<00:01:03.719> fat

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
the dermis so that the PO septal fat

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.630 
the dermis so that the PO septal fat
actually<00:01:04.320> begins<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> descend<00:01:04.979> further<00:01:05.250> down

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
actually begins to descend further down

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.179 
actually begins to descend further down
causing<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.479> narrow<00:01:06.930> palpebral<00:01:07.619> fissure

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
causing that narrow palpebral fissure

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.080 
causing that narrow palpebral fissure
and<00:01:08.689> fuller<00:01:09.689> eyelid<00:01:10.140> contour<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.060> are

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and fuller eyelid contour so there are

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.999 
and fuller eyelid contour so there are
many<00:01:12.270> techniques<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.140> Asian<00:01:13.439> eyelids<00:01:13.829> I

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
many techniques to do Asian eyelids I

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.639 
many techniques to do Asian eyelids I
really<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.030> migrated<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.689> almost<00:01:16.079> entirely

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
really have migrated now almost entirely

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.230 
really have migrated now almost entirely
to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> full<00:01:17.189> incision<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:17.969> to<00:01:18.030> talk

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to the full incision I'm going to talk

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.490 
to the full incision I'm going to talk
to<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.539> about<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:19.380> that's<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.860> case<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:21.500> have

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
to you about why that's the case I have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.170 
to you about why that's the case I have
really<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.890> performed<00:01:23.369> suture<00:01:23.640> techniques<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
really not performed suture techniques I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
really not performed suture techniques I
learned<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.600> Japan<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.289> just<00:01:25.560> figured

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
learned it in Japan but I just figured

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.690 
learned it in Japan but I just figured
with<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.700> variable<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.020> fixation

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
with all the variable and fixation

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
with all the variable and fixation
longevity<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.000> wasn't<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> great<00:01:30.570> option<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
longevity that wasn't a great option I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
longevity that wasn't a great option I
don't<00:01:31.590> use<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> partial<00:01:32.340> decision<00:01:32.670> technique

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
don't use the partial decision technique

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
don't use the partial decision technique
anymore<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> full<00:01:35.009> incision

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
anymore and I really use a full incision

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
anymore and I really use a full incision
technique<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.479> problems<00:01:36.840> I've<00:01:36.960> had<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
technique the problems I've had with the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.590 
technique the problems I've had with the
partial<00:01:37.950> incision<00:01:38.369> technique<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> I've

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
partial incision technique is that I've

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.649 
partial incision technique is that I've
had<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.320> degrees<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.460> I've<00:01:41.820> lost<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> fold

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
had some degrees that I've lost the fold

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.179 
had some degrees that I've lost the fold
and<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:43.829> see<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.130> reason

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and there I don't really see a reason

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
and there I don't really see a reason
there's<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.729> much<00:01:44.909> improvement<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.780> doing<00:01:46.140> an

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
there's not much improvement in doing an

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
there's not much improvement in doing an
abreview<00:01:46.560> incision<00:01:47.189> sometimes<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.090> can

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
abreview incision sometimes you can

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.669 
abreview incision sometimes you can
actually<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.899> incision<00:01:49.289> because<00:01:49.530> it's

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
actually see the incision because it's

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.649 
actually see the incision because it's
so<00:01:49.829> abbreviated<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.450> you're

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so abbreviated and because you're

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.950 
so abbreviated and because you're
banking<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> permanent<00:01:53.570> suture<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> hold

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
banking on a permanent suture to hold

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.289 
banking on a permanent suture to hold
your<00:01:55.229> crease<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.490> lose<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.969> suture

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
your crease if you lose that suture

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.870 
your crease if you lose that suture
you're<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.109> trouble<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.039> full<00:01:59.340> incision

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
you're in trouble with a full incision

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.029 
you're in trouble with a full incision
because<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.600> temporary<00:02:01.200> suture<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> take

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
because it's a temporary suture you take

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.800 
because it's a temporary suture you take
out<00:02:02.249> at<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> end<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.030> week<00:02:03.240> you've<00:02:03.600> got

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
out at the end of one week you've got

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230 
out at the end of one week you've got
fixation<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.859> don't<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.310> fine<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:05.999> it<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
fixation so I don't I'm fine with it and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.570 
fixation so I don't I'm fine with it and
that<00:02:06.329> may

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
that may

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.780 
that may
they<00:02:06.700> feel<00:02:06.910> much<00:02:07.120> more<00:02:07.330> comfortable<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:09.250> really

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
they feel much more comfortable I really

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.670 
they feel much more comfortable I really
like<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> Falls<00:02:10.300> full<00:02:10.720> incision<00:02:11.170> technique<00:02:11.560> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
like the Falls full incision technique I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.610 
like the Falls full incision technique I
think<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.950> works<00:02:12.130> very<00:02:12.250> very<00:02:12.460> well<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.840> give

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
think it works very very well I give

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.590 
think it works very very well I give

really goes over this very well and I

really goes over this very well and I
really<00:02:25.000> almost<00:02:25.540> always<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> small

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
really almost always just do a small

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
really almost always just do a small
fold<00:02:26.890> today<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.610> reasons<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.060> enumerated

this<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> schematic<00:02:29.440> from<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> book<00:02:30.130> that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
this is a schematic from the book that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.800 
this is a schematic from the book that
just<00:02:30.490> gives<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.760> an<00:02:30.820> idea<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.330> how<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
just gives you an idea of how to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.890 
just gives you an idea of how to
approach<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:33.000> some<00:02:34.000> ideas<00:02:34.360> for<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.660> people

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
approach this some ideas for the people

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.690 
approach this some ideas for the people
that<00:02:35.020> actually<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.410> perform<00:02:35.830> Asian<00:02:36.070> eyelids<00:02:36.460> I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
that actually do perform Asian eyelids I

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.730 
that actually do perform Asian eyelids I
would<00:02:36.880> say<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.450> key<00:02:37.660> here<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.380> like

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
would say that the key here is I like

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.200 
would say that the key here is I like
using<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.100> little<00:02:39.310> bit<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.490> marking<00:02:39.910> even

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
using a little bit of marking even

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.030 
using a little bit of marking even
though<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.570> only<00:02:40.840> takes<00:02:41.140> about<00:02:41.230> 30<00:02:41.590> minutes<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
though it only takes about 30 minutes to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.010 
though it only takes about 30 minutes to
do<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.340> because<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.850> use<00:02:43.090> such<00:02:43.330> low<00:02:43.540> doses<00:02:43.990> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
do it because I use such low doses of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.199 
do it because I use such low doses of
lidocaine<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.740> minimize<00:02:45.370> distortion<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
lidocaine to minimize distortion a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.940 
lidocaine to minimize distortion a
little<00:02:46.690> marcaine<00:02:47.110> helps<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.530> carry<00:02:47.770> that

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
little marcaine helps to carry that

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.850 
little marcaine helps to carry that
forward<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.570> raised<00:02:50.050> wheels<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.680> don't

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
forward and I raised wheels I don't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.949 
forward and I raised wheels I don't
thread<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.580> needle<00:02:51.730> through<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> risk

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
thread the needle through so that I risk

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.230 
thread the needle through so that I risk
I<00:02:53.140> don't<00:02:53.290> risk<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.650> hematoma<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.820> helps

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
I don't risk a hematoma and that helps

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.560 
I don't risk a hematoma and that helps
minimize<00:02:55.990> distortion<00:02:56.520> anytime<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.700> get<00:02:57.910> one

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
minimize distortion anytime you get one

other you can't read symmetry so I'll go
in<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.900> add<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> little<00:03:02.380> bit<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.650> one

in there and add a little bit to one
side<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.190> i<00:03:03.310> think<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.270> edema<00:03:04.570> is

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
side of i think that the edema is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.050 
side of i think that the edema is
causing<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.320> distortion<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.370> also<00:03:06.670> be<00:03:06.850> very

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
causing the distortion it also be very

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.330 
causing the distortion it also be very
careful<00:03:07.660> not<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:08.140> allow<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.350> anesthetic<00:03:09.250> to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
drip onto the levator that happens i've

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
drip onto the levator that happens i've
had<00:03:11.410> one<00:03:11.590> or<00:03:11.709> two<00:03:11.739> cases<00:03:12.250> where<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.880> levator

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
had one or two cases where the levator

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.850 
had one or two cases where the levator
has<00:03:13.450> temporary<00:03:13.930> dysfunction<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.650> can't

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
has temporary dysfunction and you can't

has temporary dysfunction and you can't
read<00:03:15.040> symmetry<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:16.480> always<00:03:17.050> work<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.440> tandem

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
read symmetry so always work in tandem

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.890 
read symmetry so always work in tandem
almost<00:03:18.160> everything<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:18.820> do<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.269> facial<00:03:19.450> plastic

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
thinking how to go from back and forth

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.250 
thinking how to go from back and forth
to<00:03:26.320> stay<00:03:26.739> consistent<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.420> really<00:03:28.780> find<00:03:29.080> your

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
to stay consistent and really find your

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.960 
to stay consistent and really find your
fat<00:03:29.440> first<00:03:29.769> if<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.220> don't<00:03:30.370> find<00:03:30.610> your<00:03:30.760> fat

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
fat first if you don't find your fat

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.729 
fat first if you don't find your fat
you're<00:03:31.269> going<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> get<00:03:31.630> into<00:03:31.780> trouble<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.620> is

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
you're going to get into trouble that is

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.190 
you're going to get into trouble that is
your<00:03:32.950> safety<00:03:33.220> landmark<00:03:33.850> be<00:03:34.090> on<00:03:34.209> after<00:03:34.690> which

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
your safety landmark be on after which

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.770 
your safety landmark be on after which
you<00:03:36.070> can<00:03:36.280> find<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.670> levator<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.269> find<00:03:37.630> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
you can find the levator but find the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.509 
you can find the levator but find the
fat<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.230> your<00:03:38.380> safety<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.160> thing<00:03:39.489> that

there you make a crease well there's

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.220 
there you make a crease well there's
several<00:04:40.820> problems<00:04:41.180> one<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.840> fact<00:04:42.110> that

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
several problems one is the fact that

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.200 
several problems one is the fact that
because<00:04:43.010> they<00:04:43.160> already<00:04:43.580> have<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.940> narrow

they're<00:04:46.850> not<00:04:47.000> going<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.270> see<00:04:47.419> much<00:04:47.540> change<00:04:47.600> if

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
they're not going to see much change if

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.230 
they're not going to see much change if
you<00:04:48.710> start<00:04:48.950> digging<00:04:49.190> into<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.610> post<00:04:49.850> septal

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
you start digging into the post septal

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.840 
you start digging into the post septal
tissues<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.810> take<00:04:50.990> fat<00:04:51.320> out<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:52.130> also<00:04:52.340> risk

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
tissues and take fat out you also risk

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.320 
tissues and take fat out you also risk
creating<00:04:53.270> an<00:04:53.660> inadvertent<00:04:54.820> fixation<00:04:55.820> in<00:04:56.030> a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
variable fixation of that crease that's

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.800 
variable fixation of that crease that's
a<00:04:58.669> problem<00:04:58.850> they<00:04:59.060> didn't<00:04:59.210> want<00:04:59.360> to<00:04:59.419> crease<00:04:59.630> and

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
a problem they didn't want to crease and

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.360 
a problem they didn't want to crease and
you've<00:04:59.930> got<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.080> crappy<00:05:00.410> crease<00:05:00.770> that's<00:05:01.070> that's

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
you've got a crappy crease that's that's

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.000 
you've got a crappy crease that's that's
terrible<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.870> be<00:05:02.990> careful<00:05:03.440> with<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:03.590> and

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
terrible so be careful with that and

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.800 
terrible so be careful with that and
what<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.280> usually<00:05:04.550> wind<00:05:05.060> up<00:05:05.150> doing<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.600> if<00:05:05.750> a

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
what I usually wind up doing is if a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.780 
what I usually wind up doing is if a
patient<00:05:06.230> comes<00:05:06.260> in<00:05:06.740> without<00:05:06.950> an<00:05:07.400> eyelid

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
patient comes in without an eyelid

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.790 
patient comes in without an eyelid
crease<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.360> they<00:05:08.720> want<00:05:08.960> rejuvenation<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
crease and they want rejuvenation of the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.830 
crease and they want rejuvenation of the
upper<00:05:10.100> eyelid<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.610> offer<00:05:10.820> them<00:05:11.090> two<00:05:11.360> options

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
upper eyelid I offer them two options

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.320 
upper eyelid I offer them two options
option<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:13.100> create<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.580> crease<00:05:13.850> and<00:05:14.120> they<00:05:14.240> have

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
option a I create a crease and they have

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330 
option a I create a crease and they have
to<00:05:14.450> understand<00:05:14.930> what<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.410> means<00:05:15.740> they're

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
to understand what that means they're

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.159 
to understand what that means they're
going<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.820> look<00:05:16.970> slightly<00:05:17.270> different<00:05:17.450> I<00:05:17.900> make

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
going to look slightly different I make

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.320 
going to look slightly different I make
very<00:05:18.560> low<00:05:18.800> prices<00:05:19.220> though<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:19.610> it's<00:05:19.760> not<00:05:20.030> much

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
very low prices though so it's not much

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.240 
very low prices though so it's not much
of<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.600> change<00:05:20.840> but<00:05:21.350> they<00:05:21.500> got<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.890> know<00:05:21.919> that

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
of a change but they got to know that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.760 
of a change but they got to know that
and<00:05:22.460> there<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.790> protracted<00:05:23.770> recovery

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
and there is a protracted recovery

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.320 
and there is a protracted recovery
period<00:05:25.100> with<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.490> because<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:26.060> some<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.270> the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
period with that because of some of the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.030 
period with that because of some of the
swelling<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.870> I'll<00:05:27.380> show<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.740> in<00:05:27.890> a

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
swelling and I'll show you that in a

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.040 
swelling and I'll show you that in a
moment<00:05:28.190> graphically<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.810> other<00:05:29.930> thing

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
moment graphically and the other thing

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.170 
moment graphically and the other thing
if<00:05:30.380> they<00:05:30.560> don't<00:05:30.740> want<00:05:30.950> it<00:05:31.070> fat<00:05:31.520> grafting<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
if they don't want it fat grafting I the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.969 
if they don't want it fat grafting I the
obviously<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:32.900> filter<00:05:33.169> my<00:05:33.350> world<00:05:33.560> through<00:05:33.770> fat

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
obviously I filter my world through fat

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.200 
obviously I filter my world through fat
grafting<00:05:34.370> because<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.669> get<00:05:34.820> great<00:05:35.030> results

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
grafting because I get great results

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.330 
grafting because I get great results
with<00:05:35.510> that<00:05:35.780> but<00:05:36.169> I'll<00:05:36.290> fill<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.770> brow<00:05:37.010> up<00:05:37.220> a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
with that but I'll fill that brow up a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.830 
with that but I'll fill that brow up a
little<00:05:37.550> bit<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:37.970> looks<00:05:38.150> amazing<00:05:38.240> and

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
little bit and it looks amazing and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.750 
little bit and it looks amazing and
that's<00:05:39.290> what<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.560> those<00:05:39.919> are<00:05:40.040> my<00:05:40.130> two<00:05:40.190> options

that's what I those are my two options

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.730 
that's what I those are my two options
and<00:05:40.940> that's<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.330> no<00:05:41.540> snow<00:05:41.900> skin<00:05:42.200> removal<00:05:42.620> by

and that's it no snow skin removal by

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.800 
and that's it no snow skin removal by
itself<00:05:43.040> without<00:05:43.669> a<00:05:43.850> fixation<00:05:44.270> of<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:44.540> crease

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
removal if you don't mean it to create a

the reason they look fake is that brown

the reason they look fake is that brown
