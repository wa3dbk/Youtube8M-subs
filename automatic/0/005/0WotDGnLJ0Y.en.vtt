00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
eventual I think we've all been waiting

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.000 
eventual I think we've all been waiting
for<00:00:49.719> anyone<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.230> was<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.440> fan<00:00:50.589> of<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.829> show

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
beyond 2000 in the 90s will have been

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.020 
beyond 2000 in the 90s will have been
waiting<00:00:53.769> for<00:00:53.920> bated<00:00:54.010> breath<00:00:54.309> for<00:00:54.370> technology

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
waiting for bated breath for technology

giveaway if you're hoping to use the
walkie-talkie<00:01:23.380> watch<00:01:23.950> for<00:01:24.130> any<00:01:24.250> sort<00:01:24.369> of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
walkie-talkie watch for any sort of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.840 
walkie-talkie watch for any sort of
covert<00:01:24.939> activity<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:26.290> quite<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.890> big<00:01:27.159> area<00:01:27.430> yeah

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
covert activity so quite a big area yeah

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.029 
covert activity so quite a big area yeah
but<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.360> means<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:28.899> be<00:01:29.020> pulled<00:01:29.320> out<00:01:29.469> from<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
but that means to be pulled out from the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.249 
but that means to be pulled out from the
watch<00:01:30.219> to<00:01:30.610> operate<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.210> walking<00:01:31.600> talking<00:01:31.840> mode

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
watch to operate in walking talking mode

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.249 
watch to operate in walking talking mode
so<00:01:32.710> what<00:01:32.829> i<00:01:32.860> would<00:01:33.009> do<00:01:33.610> if<00:01:33.850> i<00:01:34.210> had<00:01:34.780> bought<00:01:35.049> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
so what i would do if i had bought the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.170 
so what i would do if i had bought the
watch<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.710> always<00:01:36.219> walk<00:01:36.549> around<00:01:36.579> with<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
watch is always walk around with the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.719 
watch is always walk around with the
aerial<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:37.570> yeah<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.009> people<00:01:39.189> don't<00:01:39.610> know

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
aerial up yeah just so people don't know

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.069 
aerial up yeah just so people don't know
whether<00:01:39.880> I'm<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.119> walkie-talkie<00:01:40.570> or<00:01:40.719> not<00:01:40.899> and

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
whether I'm on walkie-talkie or not and

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.020 
whether I'm on walkie-talkie or not and
this<00:01:41.229> thing<00:01:41.409> it's<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.619> watch<00:01:41.859> feature<00:01:42.219> don't

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030

here's<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.189> thing<00:01:51.399> hmm<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.210> great<00:01:52.479> thing

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
here's the thing hmm the great thing

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.300 
here's the thing hmm the great thing
about<00:01:52.750> walkie-talkies<00:01:53.649> is<00:01:53.890> obviously

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
about walkie-talkies is obviously

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.590 
about walkie-talkies is obviously
they'll<00:01:54.490> each<00:01:54.700> speak<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.060> somebody<00:01:55.240> that's<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
they'll each speak to somebody that's a

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.990 
they'll each speak to somebody that's a
short<00:01:55.810> distance<00:01:55.960> away<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:56.619> was<00:01:57.280> bagging<00:01:57.729> homies

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
short distance away I was bagging homies

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.819 
short distance away I was bagging homies
about<00:01:58.299> his<00:01:58.600> walkie-talkie<00:01:58.990> watches<00:01:59.500> earlier

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
about his walkie-talkie watches earlier

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.679 
about his walkie-talkie watches earlier
today<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.399> experimental<00:02:00.969> is<00:02:01.119> anything

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
today so the experimental is anything

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.340 
today so the experimental is anything
today<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.310> challenge<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.789> set<00:02:04.350> will

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
today is and the challenge is set will

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.130 
today is and the challenge is set will
these<00:02:05.590> walkie-talkies<00:02:06.749> have<00:02:07.749> a<00:02:07.780> better

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
these walkie-talkies have a better

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.310 
these walkie-talkies have a better
distance<00:02:08.710> than<00:02:09.190> yelling<00:02:09.610> range<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:11.080> what

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
distance than yelling range so what

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.540 
distance than yelling range so what
we're<00:02:11.470> going<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.680> do<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.250> give<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.460> an

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
we're going to do just to give you an

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.910 
we're going to do just to give you an
idea<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:12.970> studios<00:02:13.450> here<00:02:14.020> we're<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:14.830> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
idea of the studios here we're going to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.790 
idea of the studios here we're going to
open<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> door<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:16.270> ouh<00:02:16.960> have<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.440> walkie

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
talkie watch so make sure the aerials up

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.880 
talkie watch so make sure the aerials up
don't<00:02:19.750> try<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:19.930> cheat<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.319> experiment<00:02:20.830> you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
don't try and cheat this experiment you

that I'm well aware that the only thing
you<00:02:33.850> really<00:02:34.000> do<00:02:34.240> with<00:02:34.330> walkie-talkies<00:02:34.630> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
you really do with walkie-talkies is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.040 
you really do with walkie-talkies is
just<00:02:35.860> radio<00:02:36.700> somebody<00:02:36.970> go<00:02:37.120> where<00:02:37.480> are<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.900> as

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
just radio somebody go where are you as

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.270 
just radio somebody go where are you as

a kid that's the only point to have a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.740 
a kid that's the only point to have a
walkie-talkie<00:02:39.550> where<00:02:40.060> are<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:40.330> i'm<00:02:40.510> outside

can hear you keep walking yes I can hear

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.440 
can hear you keep walking yes I can hear
you<00:02:56.650> walk<00:02:57.040> further<00:02:57.310> away<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.730> can<00:02:57.970> still<00:02:58.210> see

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
you walk further away I can still see

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.120 
you walk further away I can still see
you<00:02:58.480> I<00:03:03.390> made<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.540> Abby<00:03:04.780> made<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.260> comeback<00:03:05.590> stop

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
you I made a Abby made a comeback stop

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.230 
you I made a Abby made a comeback stop
there<00:03:06.340> stop<00:03:08.490> I'm<00:03:09.490> beginning<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:09.970> lose

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
there stop I'm beginning to lose

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.220 
there stop I'm beginning to lose
reception<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.080> can<00:03:11.380> hear<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:16.690> Mayday

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
reception but I can hear you know Mayday

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.090 
reception but I can hear you know Mayday
Mayday<00:03:17.560> stop<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.490> repeat<00:03:18.820> stop<00:03:19.210> over<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:23.100> think

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
Mayday stop I repeat stop over I think

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.920 
Mayday stop I repeat stop over I think
that's<00:03:24.250> probably<00:03:24.490> about<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.060> limit<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
that's probably about the limit of the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.080 
that's probably about the limit of the
walkie<00:03:26.140> talkie<00:03:26.740> over<00:03:27.310> i'm<00:03:27.460> going<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.670> open<00:03:27.790> the

walkie talkie over i'm going to open the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.360 
walkie talkie over i'm going to open the
door<00:03:28.300> now<00:03:28.450> just<00:03:28.870> yell<00:03:29.290> not<00:03:29.920> on<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.160> walkie

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
door now just yell not on the walkie

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.010 
door now just yell not on the walkie
talkie<00:03:30.820> we'll<00:03:30.970> see<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:31.180> we<00:03:31.240> can<00:03:31.390> hear<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.600> over
