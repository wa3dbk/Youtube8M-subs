00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.010
 My name is Alberto Castro I am a technician in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.110
 the beekeeping of the year 89 and I am director 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 technician at pitt you choose a consultancy 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.740
 integral apiculture we have developed 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 new technologies for the sector 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.180
 beekeeping as the alarm system of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.600
 beehives computer software for the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.750
 traceability and an innovative beehive 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.239
 pollination we form ourselves in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.220
 South America here in Spain 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.930
 unfortunately there are no big centers 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.329
 of training or selection centers 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.630
 beekeeping so we had to go to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.220
 outside of Spain- to form us in 2002 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.970
 we started to develop the software 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.190
 computer 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.200
 in 2006 we started making the system 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.180
 alarm clock the last thing that 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.820
 we have developed has been stations 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.140
 pollination and a project called 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.030
 the path of the bee that we are 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.640
 trying to promote here in 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.460
 extremadura those are the main 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.690
 technological innovations and what we 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.510
 We dedicate mainly is to the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.580
 beekeeping training for the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.100
 trafic cultists like amateur people or 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.450
 semi-professionals happy time and it 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.640
 installed in fuel they liked went 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.250
 first as a result of the development of the first 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.760
 annual beekeeping workshop that is done in 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.560
 Spain 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.660
 and then seeing the possibilities of the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.790
 zone since it's the town was the 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.830
 site that occurs virtually the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.220
 10% of national production and there is more 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.480
 of 350 farms we decided 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.980
 create tools for beekeepers 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.600
 technologies and new techniques such as 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.820
 Queen breeding clients 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.080
 potentials are mainly people who 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.370
 you want to start in the activity 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.090
 agricultural which we do to them 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.320
 investment installation projects and 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.690
 after beekeepers who want 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 specialize in topics other than 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.430
 honey as the queen rearing production 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.100
 of propolis pollen and so on are the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.300
 young people we say more and incorporate 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.480
 these new technologies to their 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.760
 farms because people already from 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.800
 advanced age and with traditional uses 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.620
 It is harder for them not to get close 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.900
 we give workshops and give talks 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.730
 but especially young people who 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.700
 initiates and the one that diversifies above all 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.130
 the production a beekeeper does not form 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.190
 in a year or two the beekeeping material 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.330
 and beekeeping is very easy to grow but 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.050
 control it 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.310
 so yes it is true that there are good 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.780
 helps for those who start the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.240
 peak activity the first aid 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.010
 installation improvement plans premiums 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.980
 pollination is very subsidized the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.900
 beekeeping but lack more training in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.100
 Spain as said before missing a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.470
 national training center 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.870
 even professional training that does not 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.400
 exists in all of Spain 'and what is missing 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.600
 center selection for the theme 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.220
 queens that beekeepers like 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.170
 any other livestock can buy 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.670
 a selected cattle and they have it 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.670
 do them on their own if they know
