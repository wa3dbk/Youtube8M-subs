skeletons don't get any skulls and then

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.770 
skeletons don't get any skulls and then
none<00:04:19.560> come<00:04:19.799> back<00:04:19.950> again<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.940> there's<00:04:21.480> none

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
none come back again so there's none

against so I hope that has something to
do<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.550> because<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:24.930> moment

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
do with that because to this moment

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.020 
do with that because to this moment
there<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.470> no<00:04:25.680> wither<00:04:25.890> skeletons<00:04:26.460> in<00:04:26.610> my

fortress anymore and I never even got

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.010 
fortress anymore and I never even got
one<00:04:29.520> skull<00:04:29.910> just<00:04:30.150> give<00:04:30.300> me<00:04:30.360> one<00:04:30.510> skull<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:30.990> I

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
one skull just give me one skull so I

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.830 
one skull just give me one skull so I
can<00:04:31.230> duplicate<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.920> I'll<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.220> fine

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
can duplicate it and I'll be fine

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.060 
can duplicate it and I'll be fine
brought<00:04:33.840> forward<00:04:34.139> change<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.710> which<00:04:34.920> is
