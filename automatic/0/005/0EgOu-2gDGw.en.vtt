00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 very good burritos we're all in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.529
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 let's see a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.150
 mode a mod that is pretty cool and is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.150
 a mountain super smash bros 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.710
 I am no longer going to the call with 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.529
 autonomy is petando jump is that I am 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.539
 I'm not the lame people or more out 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 a leg 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.270
 let's see a bot of smash bros that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.920
 he's pretty cool 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.160
 is also hurting or are they 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.160
 burning 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.590
 can be 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.290
 is that I have it so strong the sound that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.710
 look at not explaining them ordinary 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.790
 in the helmets no but let's look 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.080
 even inside a stone or something 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.080
 there seems to be nothing 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.990
 but well let's see the usual 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.400
 question the mode adds some 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.860
 characters that we will now test 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.200
 in super battle stadium chats and 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.720
 tracks and always under the same stadium 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.260
 of this weird battle we're going to remove 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.150
 all this trophies baths with a trophy 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.360
 of mario and lucky molarÃ­a if you could 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.300
 place on the ground but you can not 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.430
 mario trophy is cool a lot of the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.820
 master hand 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.200
 not uncommon but by the way it has been 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 delayed smash bros in the channel 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.210
 secondary is more super smash bros brawl 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.409
 whole 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.299
 this time the first chapter of the 3ds 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.890
 that I will keep going up and when the 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.800
 from wiiu well we will also climb smash 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.080
 you have the description by wiiu 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.600
 if it's cool 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.030
 and we're going to see more little things the only bad thing 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.940
 of the objects in this mod is that only 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.070
 you can create the hammer and these do not 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.080
 they have kraft the hammer so they are two 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.100
 sticks and three good stone has 60 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.259
 which is an outrageous year 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.030
 Making it but good is your thing 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.340
 also then we have the like 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.590
 approach with the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.159
 there is how to continue with ammunition is 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.159
 simply this 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.110
 also of pimp then the smart is 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.060
 Spanish 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.050
 it's like a molar grenade that looks 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.290
 because I do not know very well where I am 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.819
 attacking but good and then the bat the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.219
 baseball bat that has 10 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.349
 is new reality let's try it no 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.049
 I have to try a pig and it has gone to 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.540
 take by beige bag and horst so follows 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.819
 without the kids I feel sorry for you 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.269
 I think and so much tango that I feel sorry 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 a lot of pixels but the bread already 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.150
 let the unit send it to take 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.239
 force as of a bunch ok we're going to 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 see mario for example is like ball 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.389
 then we put them to fight between them 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.769
 teams that there is the grace that saw 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.150
 when you kill 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.810
 this time this releases the mario trophy 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.500
 now they have released it 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 luigi is the same but in green basically 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.400
 we have link link link visible this 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.959
 character with a write 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.260
 it's super well done I never had 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:18.010
 seen the skin of link kirby 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:23.079
 Kirby talent his profile maybe past 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.480
 mustache closer before a boss in 192 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.629
 drinks that have 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.610
 I do not attack me hate me not attack me 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.739
 but now we will face each other 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.959
 and that has to fly a lot we're going 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.340
 to send to see if we are lucky the trophy 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.530
 I should, but well, mario, too, and not 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.950
 it has been released to us as this is supposed 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.430
 what is the trophy 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.920
 Well, not that today they do not release anything 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.280
 mac 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.530
 I love little Mario in my character 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.780
 favorite of the 3ds although it has the ratio 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.580
 of lower wins is uniform but 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.010
 good is because I play myself and how am I so 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.330
 bank or look low under the world ratio 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.310
 of victories and pacman 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.910
 Oh my god, your eyes have been made 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.849
 and that you have in your eyes that fear of 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.650
 my mother is worth 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.480
 welcome to the smash bros bad paw 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.579
 well there are four dispenses is how you are 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.870
 watching out there is a super circuit 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.090
 rest in which useless is with the subtraction 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.080
 Spanish 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.849
 there it is down does not work 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.379
 and now because they do not want to hit if 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.629
 before I tried it and they were sticking 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.430
 another time, I hope it is now 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.189
 well already fixed that one down there 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.919
 Spanish sometimes take a bit in 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:38.650
 sticking to me I already know how to make it 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.669
 they think efe as saying they hit them or not 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.250
 I hit them 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.009
 now they are encouraging these two is that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.330
 the betis you see that they stay like no 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.490
 they want to stick is a little weird 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.240
 now I think they are too far 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.780
 mario marin super aggressive sometimes is the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.350
 Spanish Spanish 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.110
 I have let me'm with you 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.710
 agra ovario is worth the second round of 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.630
 battles Spanish little man mario 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.470
 schilling as it always begins 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:18.500
 they start very peaceful 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:20.660
 a little man 2 does not want to hit now 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.150
 is to try sometimes to take a ratillo of 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.650
 I do not know why 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.780
 like there comes a point where you 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.780
 piss but it it will take awhile now 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.780
 Spanish 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.510
 I'm going to subtract those two in peaceful mode 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.020
 I do not know why they sometimes attack him to be a 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.430
 little crazy good for one and little mac 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.700
 you see or not 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.420
 you have to move it to little mac because it does not 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:51.330
 I wanted to go down but it's worth one last 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.930
 Battle tracks and I almost made 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.319
 and the mca and pacman kirby and the master 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.199
 hands of having been a mother of mine 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.630
 they surpass write is the one that is going to kill 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.760
 to all the world 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.850
 in some that happen to attack I do not know very 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.000
 well why but they say I do not want to attack 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.070
 we go 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.760
 good more sharp ne many life as 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.760
 suppose attacking you 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.569
 we see him take away the Marquis from 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:27.580
 mag does not want to fight 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:31.080
 has left boxing like the troops that 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.080
 they surpass we receive, I do not know why 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.890
 nervous journalist there is going down the 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.470
 life and we have the bar there 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.040
 close apart from the bad union 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.849
 look 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.719
 madrid / palma 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:49.689
 it is called by leader plus the most expensive 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:52.289
 now if mario does not loose several 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.330
 results 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.310
 and 14 of white bidasoa have been 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.960
 stayed two of life inside 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.880
 Here is the trophy from the nearest 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.340
 but it's good since the engine is a 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.920
 curious 7 that is pretty cool 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.300
 we left pacman there of winner I hope 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.810
