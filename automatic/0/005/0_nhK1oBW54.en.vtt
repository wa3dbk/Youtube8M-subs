the<00:01:58.770> other<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.220> made<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.520> higher<00:01:59.760> but<00:02:00.690> I

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
the other one was made the higher but I

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.870 
the other one was made the higher but I
like<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.470> one<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> lot<00:02:01.800> better<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.220> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
like this one a lot better because the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.010 
like this one a lot better because the
fan<00:02:03.149> exhaust<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> outside<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.340> old

fan exhaust to the outside the old
microwave<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.440> has<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> same<00:02:07.920> fan<00:02:08.340> design<00:02:08.790> but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
microwave it has the same fan design but

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.999 
microwave it has the same fan design but
the<00:02:09.899> old<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.320> lot<00:02:10.470> smaller<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> was

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the old one was a lot smaller it was

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.610 
the old one was a lot smaller it was
like<00:02:11.160> 800<00:02:11.700> watts<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.209> no<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.690> was<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.810> thousand

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.040 

but<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.550> fan<00:02:17.850> wasn't<00:02:18.540> even<00:02:18.810> bolted

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
but it was on the fan wasn't even bolted

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.470 
but it was on the fan wasn't even bolted
down<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.680> sort<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.370> vibrated<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
down and it sort of vibrated and it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.229 
down and it sort of vibrated and it
moved<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.380> where<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.680> did<00:02:22.860> rolled<00:02:23.700> itself<00:02:24.000> over

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
moved to where we did rolled itself over

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.640 
moved to where we did rolled itself over
to<00:02:24.360> where<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.780> discharged<00:02:25.260> air<00:02:25.440> into

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
to where we're just discharged air into

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
on low 300 on honey I believe um fan

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.510 
on low 300 on honey I believe um fan
let's<00:02:36.660> turn<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.200> fan<00:02:37.410> on<00:02:37.440> high

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
let's turn the fan on high

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.980 
let's turn the fan on high
that<00:02:40.520> thing<00:02:40.730> moves<00:02:40.880> me<00:02:41.090> series<00:02:41.510> there<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.720> can

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
that thing moves me series there I can

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.590 
that thing moves me series there I can
feel<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.410> let's<00:02:42.680> turn<00:02:42.830> down<00:02:42.890> low

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
feel it let's turn down low

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600 
feel it let's turn down low
that's<00:02:44.600> 150<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.710> that's<00:02:45.950> off

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
that's 150 and that's off

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.450 
that's 150 and that's off
there's<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.450> digital<00:02:48.320> CAD<00:02:48.650> which<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> lot

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
there's the digital CAD which is a lot

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.720 
there's the digital CAD which is a lot
easier<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:50.090> use<00:02:50.330> than<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.840> dadgum<00:02:51.800> old

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
easier to use than the dadgum old
