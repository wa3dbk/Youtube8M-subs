that<00:02:13.959> made<00:02:14.110> me<00:02:14.140> feel<00:02:14.380> very<00:02:14.410> welcome<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.130> well

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
that made me feel very welcome so well

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.130 
that made me feel very welcome so well
it's<00:02:15.850> going<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.180> well<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.569> I'm<00:02:16.840> enjoying

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
it's going really well and I'm enjoying

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.990 
it's going really well and I'm enjoying
this<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:18.130> whole<00:02:18.340> sort<00:02:18.610> team<00:02:18.790> atmosphere

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
this this whole sort team atmosphere

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.300 
this this whole sort team atmosphere
here<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:20.319> are<00:02:20.410> your<00:02:20.530> expectations<00:02:20.799> for

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
here what are your expectations for

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.530 
here what are your expectations for
today<00:02:21.549> especially<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.299> weather<00:02:22.420> being

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
today especially with the weather being

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.539 
today especially with the weather being
like<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.440> think<00:02:23.830> first<00:02:24.040> thing<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.400> stay

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
like this I think first thing is to stay

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.550 
like this I think first thing is to stay
on<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.880> track<00:02:25.060> we've<00:02:25.959> just<00:02:25.989> been<00:02:26.320> out<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
on the track we've just been out the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.890 
on the track we've just been out the
back<00:02:26.709> watching<00:02:26.860> italian<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.970> support<00:02:28.720> race

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
back watching italian the support race

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.600 
back watching italian the support race
that<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.260> looks<00:02:29.410> quite<00:02:29.709> exciting<00:02:30.489> out<00:02:30.579> there

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
that it looks quite exciting out there

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.180 
that it looks quite exciting out there
in<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.239> rain<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.500> main<00:02:32.650> thing<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.950> try

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
in the rain so the main thing is to try

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.530 
in the rain so the main thing is to try
and<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.459> car<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.880> end<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.150> race<00:02:34.299> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
and get the car to the end of the race I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.569 
and get the car to the end of the race I
think<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.560> would<00:02:35.620> be<00:02:35.680> quite<00:02:35.829> difficult<00:02:36.100> with

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
think that would be quite difficult with

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.310 
think that would be quite difficult with
the<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.090> conditions<00:02:37.900> we<00:02:38.049> have<00:02:38.170> today

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
the with the conditions we have today

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.830 
the with the conditions we have today
but<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.040> know<00:02:39.130> if<00:02:39.250> all<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.549> drivers<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:40.120> go

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
but you know if all the drivers just go

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.050 
but you know if all the drivers just go
sensibly<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.470> try<00:02:42.220> not<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> risk<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.730> car<00:02:42.910> too

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
sensibly and try not to risk the car too

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.160 
sensibly and try not to risk the car too
much<00:02:43.239> then<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.510> should<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> good<00:02:43.930> chance

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
much then we should have a good chance

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
much then we should have a good chance
and<00:02:44.440> if<00:02:45.310> we<00:02:45.370> get<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> end<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.239> there's<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and if we get to the end and there's a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.000 
and if we get to the end and there's a
good<00:02:46.600> chance<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.079> we<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> result<00:02:47.920> in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
good chance that we can have a result in

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.259 
good chance that we can have a result in
the<00:02:48.070> class<00:02:48.280> if<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.609> can<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.880> in<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> top<00:02:49.209> three

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
the class if we can be in the top three

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.349 
the class if we can be in the top three
in<00:02:49.660> SB<00:02:50.019> 10<00:02:50.230> then<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.700> would<00:02:51.700> be<00:02:51.820> very<00:02:51.850> happy<00:02:52.060> with

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
in SB 10 then I would be very happy with

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.550 
in SB 10 then I would be very happy with
that<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.870> team<00:02:53.049> will<00:02:53.079> be<00:02:53.320> happy

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
that and I think the team will be happy

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.650 
that and I think the team will be happy
with<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.519> what<00:02:54.790> makes<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.180> new<00:02:55.329> booking

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
with that and what makes the new booking

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.800 
with that and what makes the new booking
so<00:02:55.840> special<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.730> one<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.630> length

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
so special I think it's a one the length

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.050 
so special I think it's a one the length
of<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.079> circuit<00:02:59.440> been<00:02:59.650> 26<00:03:00.430> kilometers<00:03:00.970> from

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
of the circuit been 26 kilometers from

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.910 
of the circuit been 26 kilometers from
the<00:03:01.150> fire

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the fire

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.590 
the fire
there<00:03:02.920> isn't<00:03:03.190> really<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.430> circuit<00:03:04.060> that's<00:03:04.210> used

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
there isn't really a circuit that's used

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.960 
there isn't really a circuit that's used
nowadays<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.440> has<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.620> length<00:03:06.010> also<00:03:06.790> that

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
nowadays that has that length also that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270 
nowadays that has that length also that
it's<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.990> know<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.200> undulations<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:09.130> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
it's you know the undulations and the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's you know the undulations and the
fact<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.000> it's<00:03:10.210> very<00:03:10.780> old<00:03:11.080> school<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.560> that

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
fact that it's very old school is that

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.820 
fact that it's very old school is that
it's<00:03:12.070> not<00:03:12.130> been<00:03:12.600> given<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.870> safety<00:03:14.320> wand<00:03:14.560> and

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's not been given the safety wand and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.280 
it's not been given the safety wand and
and<00:03:15.730> everything<00:03:16.360> moved<00:03:16.630> away<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.110> really

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and everything moved away and really

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.860 
and everything moved away and really
safe<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.830> still<00:03:18.070> very<00:03:18.420> hard<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.750> difficult

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
safe is still very hard and difficult

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.110 
safe is still very hard and difficult
circuits<00:03:20.530> drive<00:03:20.800> them<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.580> think<00:03:21.820> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
circuits drive them and I think the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.880 
circuits drive them and I think the
challenge<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.600> what<00:03:22.810> appeals<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.590> all<00:03:23.710> the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
challenge is what appeals to all the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.890 
challenge is what appeals to all the
drivers<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:25.030> know<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.300> it's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
drivers is that you know it's it's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.180 
drivers is that you know it's it's
dangerous<00:03:26.320> out<00:03:26.440> there<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.740> I<00:03:26.920> think<00:03:27.100> most

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
dangerous out there and I think most

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.560 
dangerous out there and I think most
Rather's<00:03:27.610> enjoy<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.060> fact<00:03:28.210> that<00:03:28.300> they're
