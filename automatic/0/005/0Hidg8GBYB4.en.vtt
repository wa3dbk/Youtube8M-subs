00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello attitude friends in this video 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.220
 tutorials we will teach how to make pallets 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.960
 of his bed with miguelito and a rubber band 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:20.680
 above and chamoy modified shell 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:24.460
 but it is clear that we need chicama 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 Two- color miguelito depends on the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 color that have been imported comic and a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.330
 stick to put it what they are going to do 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.700
 skewers is that good then in this 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.250
 estraÃ±ar video is how we do 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.520
 look like this goes like this more or less is going to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.520
 stay 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.339
 or maybe better if they are better than 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.899
 us this is also a sample them 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.899
 we will teach how to do 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.109
 yes 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.429
 good since you know the ingredients 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.429
 that we repeat them again 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.810
 since you know the ingredients if 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.119
 wants we repeat ourselves since already 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:18.009
 that the best and do not bring the sheet to 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.009
 which will point the boy first 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.860
 I call 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.119
 miguelito 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.430
 well it's all then let's see 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.750
 they have already seen how it will be more or less 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.130
 so that we won the preparation 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.130
 they grab the stick 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.420
 and they are putting the magic quote 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.749
 in little squares of rosemary in 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.749
 squares 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.930
 I'm putting to see how pretty much 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.570
 will be 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.570
 and so do not put any of this on me 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.190
 good now we will do while we are going to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.190
 wait for them 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.280
 Well, she 's ready almost good 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280
 they will stay 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.070
 It depends on how many squares they want 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.650
 but there I forget or put the rubber and 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.650

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.540

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.989
 be very useful 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.349

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.720
