00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.149
 if you are pieter jan postma five minutes before the start of the medal race in the 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.689
 finn class he is in fifth position 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.829
 and that was not the signal here 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.879
 He can sail a game himself and Dave will have to do it at our best 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.410
 in consultation with his 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.720
 French support partner who does not qualify for this and more present 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.660
 have they taken the winter wind direction and the wind turns by seething for hours 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.700
 after water watching what the strategy should be for the first cruise miss watching 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.790
 to the start 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.690
 You see them looking for another place now 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.950
 is counted down to the start 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.790
 there will also be a few seconds left 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.790
 then make its way into the finch medal race 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.960
 the second kicking that someone was early was probably the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.640
 australian 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.070
 and then six more dead 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.050
 that is in the forest but fortunately it has not increased slightly for this after the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.690
 race 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 at the same time the ladies eat fish, yeasts sail a lot easier 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.820
 biti if it is actually good with that which is good liberties it looks in terms of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.370
 speed also good 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.920
 and he can he can make his own plan 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.090
 compared to others 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.150
 we are at the top buoy in the midwest the finn class you do 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.480
 what do you see happen here i see the australian in the lead i think 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.350
 it was too early 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.070
 yes you have an hour off 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.140
 Astra who is being called by the jury is building here 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 ns to indicate that he is you 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.540
 they point out why he has understood he is now out of the race is natural 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.190
 very sour because that is the first one but yes 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.220
 he is also a little early first there I am but yes yes he 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.950
 in the end, he has got it that is classic but won the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.290
 act at he had a free winter that he had started too early 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.210
 yes it is the first beautiful official 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.409
 Great Britain as the second one in the rankings at the moment 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 Sweden 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.230
 goes as we have 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.379
 click here to view that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.529
 now it is still reasonable, but it has been declared crazy sixth place 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.349
 nevertheless a hole with the first 3 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.790
 yes the city is postma year that is 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.480
 I don't quite see what happened, I think, was not the ideal start 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:26.969
 but the sixth place 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.119
 There is no dramatic saying the wind has a secret weapon that is what the 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:31.809
 speed 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.709
 I hope I worked there too 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.579
 to sit with the abduction casper 10 sec 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.819
 the croatia in the lead 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.909
 and then 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.549
 bosma in fifth place almost simultaneously going to be here 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 crowe 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.359
 Pieter Jan Postma 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.869
 and made the Swedish Dario beer 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.109
 he fights for the first place at the top buoy and in a third the finn 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:00.909
 class 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.780
 Fox made insanely good second missile danger is the room completely 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:05.959
 for the dangers 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.969
 citigate that time the farmer was up 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.639
 really super he did 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.529
 he has very controlling danger in emmen and the good hits 9 good ones 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.059
 wind gusts and rough turning 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.759
 he has entered an insane amount of boat and 8 5 the fellow man among the six 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.789
 about 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.469
 and 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:25.550
 and maybe just 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.419
 14 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.479
 last year he also won the mentor 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.509
 and the rhythm seventh 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:33.809
 what you are going i hope 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.119
 and he is nevertheless happy with it, there is also a nice feeling about the church 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 series 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.959
 vivian 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.199
 certainly today 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.779
 yes nice match 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.779
 thereby proved the exciting and 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.299
 yes I find that extra beautiful 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.120
 and I did not have a good start I had the wrong cruising first cross 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.399
 winning a number of matches is completely broken from 5 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.159
 guess that is pretty hole 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.889
 So 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.189
 Kruis had overtaken a super five places 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.869
 yes I did not see it just come there 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 and over the player one and the scp 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.139
 after a difficult situation today 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.650
 Jacob 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.780
 and 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.629
 if it gets difficult yes 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.930
 then the extra challenge for extra beautiful and then I succeed 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.680
 feel good back home yes you are honest 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 rkc next week is good preparation and 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.219
 enjoy it here 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.650
