00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
let's jump right in right off the bat

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
let's jump right in right off the bat
I've<00:01:02.280> actually<00:01:02.490> pressed<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> record<00:01:03.480> button

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I've actually pressed the record button

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.459 
I've actually pressed the record button
on<00:01:04.199> both<00:01:04.399> cameras<00:01:05.399> at<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.609> same<00:01:05.969> time<00:01:06.469> however

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
on both cameras at the same time however

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.200 
on both cameras at the same time however
you<00:01:07.679> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.130> away<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.640> kopecks

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you can see right away that the kopecks

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
you can see right away that the kopecks
actually<00:01:09.749> takes<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.140> while<00:01:10.409> before<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.859> starts

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
actually takes a while before it starts

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
actually takes a while before it starts
recording<00:01:11.549> while<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> video<00:01:12.869> starts

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
recording while the video starts

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.190 
recording while the video starts
recording<00:01:13.590> almost<00:01:14.159> immediately<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.079> we

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
recording almost immediately so all we

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
recording almost immediately so all we
have<00:01:16.319> is<00:01:16.499> this<00:01:16.649> little<00:01:17.039> lag<00:01:17.369> between<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
have is this little lag between the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.649 
have is this little lag between the
kopecks<00:01:19.049> actually<00:01:19.439> starting<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> record<00:01:20.659> just

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
kopecks actually starting to record just

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
kopecks actually starting to record just
with<00:01:21.929> this<00:01:22.170> view<00:01:22.469> out<00:01:22.499> of<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.859> window<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.850> can

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
with this view out of the window you can

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.029 
with this view out of the window you can
see<00:01:24.179> that<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.450> contrast<00:01:25.079> for<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> coolpix<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
see that the contrast for the coolpix is

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.639 
see that the contrast for the coolpix is
actually<00:01:26.609> higher<00:01:26.929> the<00:01:27.929> colors<00:01:28.319> are<00:01:28.499> more

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
actually higher the colors are more

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.730 
actually higher the colors are more
vibrant<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.429> saturated<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:31.109> exposures

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
vibrant and saturated and the exposures

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
vibrant and saturated and the exposures
at<00:01:31.950> least<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.539> outside<00:01:33.749> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
at least for when it's outside the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.879 
at least for when it's outside the
window<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.829> pretty<00:01:35.549> balanced<00:01:36.619> also<00:01:37.619> notice

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
window is pretty balanced also notice

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.529 
window is pretty balanced also notice
how<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.100> coolpix<00:01:38.609> has<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.789> slightly<00:01:39.149> wider

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
how the coolpix has a slightly wider

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.879 
how the coolpix has a slightly wider
field<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> view<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.619> compared<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.549> Vado

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
field of view as compared to the Vado

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.889 
field of view as compared to the Vado
now<00:01:43.889> notice<00:01:44.219> what<00:01:44.399> happens<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.119> pan<00:01:45.539> into

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
now notice what happens as I pan into

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.370 
now notice what happens as I pan into
the<00:01:46.590> darker<00:01:47.039> parts<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.549> house

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
the darker parts of the house

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.449 
the darker parts of the house
notice<00:01:49.380> how<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> videos<00:01:49.979> exposure

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
notice how the videos exposure

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.309 
notice how the videos exposure
compensation<00:01:50.729> brightens<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> image

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
compensation brightens up the image

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.129 
compensation brightens up the image
right<00:01:52.709> away<00:01:53.009> whereas<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.299> kopecks<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
right away whereas for the kopecks it

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:01.489 
right away whereas for the kopecks it
actually<00:01:55.560> takes<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.889> while<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> react<00:02:00.439> now<00:02:01.439> as

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
actually takes a while to react now as

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.830 
actually takes a while to react now as
you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.709> see<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.009> moment<00:02:02.249> I<00:02:02.579> panned<00:02:03.149> into<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you can see the moment I panned into the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
you can see the moment I panned into the
brightness<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> kopecks<00:02:05.039> actually<00:02:05.549> reacts

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
brightness the kopecks actually reacts

brightness the kopecks actually reacts
faster<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> Vado<00:02:07.729> now<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.149> were<00:02:09.299> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

the default exposure that a camera has

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.300 
the default exposure that a camera has
had<00:02:30.160> gestured<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:31.230> notice<00:02:32.230> how<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
had gestured to notice how that as I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.460 
had gestured to notice how that as I
bring<00:02:33.610> my<00:02:33.760> attention<00:02:34.270> towards<00:02:34.660> window<00:02:35.140> again

the<00:02:36.069> kopecks<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.580> actually<00:02:36.970> adjusting<00:02:37.569> such

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the kopecks is actually adjusting such

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.990 
the kopecks is actually adjusting such
that<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.440> outside<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:38.980> actually<00:02:39.459> pretty<00:02:39.730> well

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that the outside is actually pretty well

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.600 
that the outside is actually pretty well
exposed<00:02:40.620> whereas<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.739> foreground<00:02:42.280> which<00:02:42.489> is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
exposed whereas the foreground which is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.259 
exposed whereas the foreground which is
the<00:02:42.760> birdcage<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.930> little<00:02:44.290> bit<00:02:44.440> too<00:02:44.590> duck

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
the birdcage is a little bit too duck

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.330 
the birdcage is a little bit too duck
the<00:02:46.269> video<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.840> other<00:02:46.959> hand<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.380> OK<00:02:48.069> with<00:02:48.250> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
the video on the other hand is OK with a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.400 
the video on the other hand is OK with a
bit<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.550> overexposure<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:50.230> why<00:02:50.350> it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
bit of overexposure and that's why it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.380 
bit of overexposure and that's why it
leaves<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.950> background<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.580> bit<00:02:51.610> too<00:02:52.120> bright

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
leaves the background a bit too bright

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.840 
leaves the background a bit too bright
this<00:02:53.200> gives<00:02:53.470> us<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.769> advantage<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:54.400> having<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
this gives us the advantage of having a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.850 
this gives us the advantage of having a
foreground<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:56.049> still<00:02:56.319> clear<00:02:56.650> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
foreground that is still clear and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.520 
foreground that is still clear and
visible<00:02:57.390> now<00:02:58.390> as<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:58.660> see<00:02:58.720> I'm<00:02:58.959> panning

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
visible now as you can see I'm panning

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.949 
visible now as you can see I'm panning
here<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.819> comparing<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.330> two<00:03:01.630> still

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
here and just comparing the two still

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.570 
here and just comparing the two still
images<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.709> see<00:03:02.769> that<00:03:03.100> there's<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.370> bit

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
images you can see that there's a bit

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.759 
images you can see that there's a bit
more<00:03:03.610> motion<00:03:04.000> blur<00:03:04.420> produced<00:03:04.989> by<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.260> coolpix

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
more motion blur produced by the coolpix

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.699 
more motion blur produced by the coolpix
as<00:03:05.980> compared<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.700> Vado

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
as compared to the Vado

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.320 
as compared to the Vado
now<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:08.920> has<00:03:09.040> pros<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:09.549> cons<00:03:10.000> because

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
now this has pros and cons because

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.780 
now this has pros and cons because
different<00:03:11.080> situations<00:03:11.860> require<00:03:12.549> different

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
different situations require different

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.210 
different situations require different

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
amounts of motion blur to correctly

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.460 
amounts of motion blur to correctly
convey<00:03:15.760> whatever<00:03:16.360> message<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.230> want

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
convey whatever message it is you want

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.370 
convey whatever message it is you want
to<00:03:17.590> convey<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.420> general<00:03:19.420> terms<00:03:19.690> however<00:03:20.019> I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
to convey in general terms however I

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.050 
to convey in general terms however I
would<00:03:20.739> actually<00:03:21.160> prefer<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.579> coolpix

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
would actually prefer the coolpix

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.500 
would actually prefer the coolpix
performance<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:22.989> point<00:03:23.400> mainly<00:03:24.400> because

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
performance at this point mainly because

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.240 
performance at this point mainly because
motion<00:03:25.510> blur<00:03:25.780> provides<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.410> smoother<00:03:26.950> looking

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
motion blur provides a smoother looking

motion blur provides a smoother looking
video<00:03:28.320> now<00:03:29.320> what<00:03:29.500> I'm<00:03:29.620> about<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:30.220> is

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
video now what I'm about to do is

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.090 
video now what I'm about to do is
actually<00:03:30.820> do<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.660> bit<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.170> shake<00:03:32.650> tests

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
actually do a bit of a shake tests

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.220 
actually do a bit of a shake tests
because<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> Phaedo<00:03:34.180> does<00:03:34.570> not<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:34.959> any

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
because the Phaedo does not have any

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.160 
because the Phaedo does not have any
form<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.739> image<00:03:36.070> stabilization<00:03:36.549> as<00:03:37.170> opposed

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
form of image stabilization as opposed

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.170 
form of image stabilization as opposed
to<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.560> coolpix<00:03:39.040> which<00:03:39.489> actually<00:03:39.850> comes<00:03:40.060> with

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
to the coolpix which actually comes with

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.069 
to the coolpix which actually comes with
a<00:03:40.390> mechanical<00:03:41.230> vibration<00:03:42.130> reduction<00:03:42.310> feature

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
a mechanical vibration reduction feature

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.090 
a mechanical vibration reduction feature
so<00:03:44.079> what<00:03:44.200> I'm<00:03:44.290> gonna<00:03:44.470> do<00:03:44.709> here<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:44.950> I'm

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.530 
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
actually<00:03:45.310> gonna<00:03:45.549> do<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> little<00:03:46.060> bit<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.420> a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
actually gonna do a little bit of a

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.069 
actually gonna do a little bit of a
sprint<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.760> can<00:03:48.910> see<00:03:49.090> how<00:03:49.239> both<00:03:49.540> cameras

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
sprint and you can see how both cameras

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.710 
sprint and you can see how both cameras
react<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.010> camera<00:03:51.310> shake<00:03:51.549> as<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.450> can<00:03:52.570> see

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
react to the camera shake as you can see

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.630 
react to the camera shake as you can see
the<00:03:52.870> video<00:03:53.200> shakes<00:03:53.500> up<00:03:53.709> pretty<00:03:53.980> badly<00:03:54.250> while

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
the video shakes up pretty badly while

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.550 
the video shakes up pretty badly while
the<00:03:54.760> kopecks<00:03:55.180> hotly<00:03:55.660> shakes<00:03:55.959> at<00:03:56.109> all

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
the kopecks hotly shakes at all

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.800 
the kopecks hotly shakes at all
now<00:03:57.130> both<00:03:57.370> cameras<00:03:57.790> exhibit<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.420> rolling

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
now both cameras exhibit the rolling

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.960 
now both cameras exhibit the rolling
shutter<00:03:58.840> effect<00:03:59.250> which<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.549> course<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
shutter effect which is of course the
