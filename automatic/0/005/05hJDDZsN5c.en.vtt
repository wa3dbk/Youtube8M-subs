00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.760
 good morning to every angel's day 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.070
 direct to the markets today Monday 18 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.860
 May you see the market we are 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.349
 observing office on dax sta 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.570
 attacking the upper part of the canal 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.260
 see this continuation figure 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.969
 that looks like a flag and what it is 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.850
 the idea of ideas that the market in some 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.219
 so you can found it practically 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.430
 support in return to 11 and 4 just above 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.960
 and that is right above practically i 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.910
 maximum that the market for the purpose that the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 market did just Friday e 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.690
 so if this should be all 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.539
 market retrace did 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 downward it is likely that the area 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.899
 around Friday highs and then 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:04.250
 unrealistic around an area 11 6 30 11 e 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.260
 40 somehow that point may not 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.950
 be more a potential area of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.479
 resistance 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.850
 there were so many seeing a lot 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.790
 interesting that the average at 20 period 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.130
 the redhead says somehow she had 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.840
 made from existence in two tests 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.810
 the last moreover did just 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.600
 Friday but there are some simple rules 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.210
 as I often say then always in shards 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.509
 the vibration that follow me that is necessary 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.549
 follow also report for example to 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.570
 medium and it is clear that if the average in 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.240
 somehow it makes me a lot more minimum 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.759
 high you can compared to the previous one 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.289
 and there is this and even more compared to 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.750
 this in the air 11170 is likely to 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.060
 precisely the resistance area being 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.490
 increasingly high potential area 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.429
 support somehow it could be 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.990
 destined to jump and then and then 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.729
 the idea is that the market can therefore 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.109
 get out of this figure of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.140
 continuing to try to do maybe 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.789
 a put on a trend that can in 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.530
 some way to reproduce maybe 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.450
 the fantastic inclination he had 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.880
 in this beginning of 2015 for which this 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.310
 is the great dilemma of taking the crater 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.110
 or lose a running train see you 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.290
 directly tomorrow remember that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.800
 then this week of the 2015 forum 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.080
 where all those who will take it 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.420
 if I will do many interventions look then the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.570
 program directly on the site 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 forum to maybe even meet 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.130
 people see you directly tomorrow 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.050
 there is an angel video and direct it 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.760
 markets to contact me you can ask me 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.410
 friendship on facebook because this is it 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.210
 the place where I normally interact 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.190
 with the people who follow me 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.600
 or because he put it to use it you can 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.850
 send me an email to that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.800
 see in overlay 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.800
 thank you god best angel soon
