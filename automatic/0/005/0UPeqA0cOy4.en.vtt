00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
Center mushroom and for this video you

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.920 
Center mushroom and for this video you
just<00:00:46.140> need<00:00:46.469> whatever<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> make

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
just need whatever you're going to make

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.330 
just need whatever you're going to make
and<00:00:48.930> whatever<00:00:49.500> mushroom<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and whatever mushroom you're going to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
and whatever mushroom you're going to
grow<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.989> for<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.379> use<00:00:52.680> both

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
grow and for this one I just use both

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
grow and for this one I just use both
brown<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> red<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.289> faster

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
brown and red so then it's going faster

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
brown and red so then it's going faster
than<00:00:55.770> each<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.219> discours<00:00:56.640> again<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.539> is

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
than each one discours again this is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.200 
than each one discours again this is
just<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> show<00:00:58.350> where<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.219> central<00:00:59.760> mushroom<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
just a show where my central mushroom is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
just a show where my central mushroom is
for<00:01:00.510> harvest<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.559> harvest<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
for harvest and so I don't harvest the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
for harvest and so I don't harvest the
center<00:01:02.640> mushroom<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:03.660> going

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
center mushroom and the one that's going

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
center mushroom and the one that's going
to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.280> once<00:01:05.790> you've<00:01:05.909> done

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to be over there so once you've done

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
to be over there so once you've done
that<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.540> sketch<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:06.869> mushroom<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> just

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that to sketch your mushroom and just

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
that to sketch your mushroom and just
place<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.430> by<00:01:08.790> right-clicking<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.110> dirt

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
place it by right-clicking on the dirt

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
place it by right-clicking on the dirt
and<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.820> hopefully<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.960> don't

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and as you can see hopefully they don't

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.460 
and as you can see hopefully they don't
they<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.820> die<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.630> whatever<00:01:15.810> because<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
they like and die or whatever because it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.399 
they like and die or whatever because it
might<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.070> too<00:01:17.220> great<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.140> that's<00:01:19.140> all

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
might be a bit too great so that's all

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.810 
might be a bit too great so that's all
you<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> mushroom<00:01:20.549> farm

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you have to do for the mushroom farm

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
you have to do for the mushroom farm
part<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:24.950> six<00:01:25.950> six

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
part so as you can see I have a six six

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
part so as you can see I have a six six
red<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> six<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.180> brown<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.020> should<00:01:28.259> grow

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
red and six a brown and they should grow

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.609 
red and six a brown and they should grow
eventually<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.689> around<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.229> remember

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
eventually a around and just remember

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.260 
eventually a around and just remember
