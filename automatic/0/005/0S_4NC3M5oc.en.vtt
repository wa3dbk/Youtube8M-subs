00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.029
 25 games have kickers out 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.009
 Offenbach not anymore 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.059
 Forbidden to this giant barrel came under 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.889
 the good news of the week 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.809
 insolvency administrator andreas kleinschmidt 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.700
 the proclaimed that the society 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.830
 is back on a solid foundation 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 and is financially rehabilitated 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.650
 a better starting position would have it for 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.240
 rico schmitt and his eleven am 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.040
 Friday night at home game against the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.990
 tus koblenz can not give 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.490
 let the first gate approach the ofc 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.779
 accordingly not very long on itself 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.520
 wait even if the guests from koblenz 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.470
 we show that someone with eight man 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.949
 stand behind the own 16er line 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.660
 so at first he jumped in 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.670
 can openers followed only 60 seconds 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.290
 later fabian baker comes over the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.730
 left side to the baseline and flanks 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.739
 just over all to benjamin 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.600
 pintol who stands completely naked and to 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.370
 leadership inserts the second 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.150
 Seasonal hit of 24 year olds 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.860
 Central feldmann 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.930
 The kickers are on the way to 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.360
 Ascending obviously not 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.820
 stop more and urban meeting 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.860
 10 brought the corner 20 minutes later 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.390
 pure martin röser extends the ball 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.680
 at the first post on the back and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.449
 there is markus müller to the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.610
 Thirteenth time this season 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.530
 ball in the net houses that 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.350
 Goalkeeping works out of all positions 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.909
 from all situations and eleven anyway 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.830
 kickers players already have this season 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.630
 scoring a goal is needed 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.689
 the guys in the relegation so before 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.490
 no team but now the guests 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.080
 koblenz also know where the goal is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.790
 even if you only have a gate in the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.570
 last five clash with the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.730
 fc succeeded 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.830
 maybe now captain boskovic 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.720
 is great for admir softic's 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.310
 Put the ball on the end of the ball 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.990
 but he does not hit the gate on 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 outside net failed the first attempt 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.580
 the guests and bad luck they still had 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.110
 Ball through kevin stolpe and ofc man 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.890
 modica somehow directs the ball 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.280
 own latte 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.870
 it remains at 2 0 break and then 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 the referee had something to do 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.820
 could do ofc with dennis and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.740
 fabian Beck off the pass with the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 head no no aside also at 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.680
 cross pass becker on shoulder 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.170
 but the last pass over again 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 Becker was probably off the gate counted 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.390
 Not 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.100
 a new attempt this time with markus 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.659
 müller and fabian baker and this 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 Querpass is good and Becker makes him 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.739
 also one and this time counts the 13 0 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.300
 and the drops was sucked 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 that was already only a question 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.780
 the height of the fourth victory in succession 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.200
 the koblenzer at a goal ratio 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 from 11 to 1 they will be in the relegation 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.739
 The kickers will be around next year 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.879
 not to come here anymore if 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.900
 She even herself 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.310
 create class 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.840
 It will be the same on the next Tuesday 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.819
 continue for the eleven by rico schmitt then 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
 You have to reach Hamburg at 19 o'clock 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:43.840
 we have a few more after the game 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:44.800
 catching a catch with 228 rolled up 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.440
 which then played too complicated 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.750
 have and then to the side again 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.430
 come out before that is done that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.950
 we get easier and clearer again 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.910
 have to play balls and the second 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.800
 Halftime very well done 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.540
 in the end then the work of a striker 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.260
 I mean so much if you like that 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.220
 it's all a bit life now 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.420
 made the moderate game and that is 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.629
 an absolute merit of the whole 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.629
 team 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.579
 we have the forward task because the gates 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.970
 to shoot that works also this time 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.970
 quite well 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.270
 yes i think a deserved one will win you 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.070
 have begun very powerful first 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.200
 time then have even the 1 0 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.040
 Made us live that way, of course 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.780
 has relieved and yes good shortly before 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.330
 At the end of the first half we have the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.890
 adversary unnecessarily a bit strong 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.970
 made of luck we can do that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.990
 then stop peat 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.420
 but good luck to the area and 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.370
 received today the hope of tra 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.320
 world leaders but we can not help it 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.700
 now extremely difficult tasks come up 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.680
 Hamburg 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:02.610
 because I am very difficult 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:03.870
 away game we have and there you build 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.230
 extremely hard boobs on ours 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.250
 assumption not at all 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.660
 fantastic development you have to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.280
 say every match day is going again 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.579
 new kickers offenbach great 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.410
 motivation fantastic attitude and 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.030
 fight until the last minute 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.720
 currently draws our team 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:33.540
 absolutely indicates and I do not know 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:36.120
 where will go yes that's our fans 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.729
 are unique in my view 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.960
 us in the league regardless of that 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.550
 we have to say that we either win or 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.200
 lose as those are behind us and 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.360
 also with the number of spectators that 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.510
 is really fantastic on when 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.950
 Friday before the game today over 7,000 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.360
 then spectators against Koblenz the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.580
 third last of the table 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.229
 that's something special but we 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.610
 Of course we hope that in the last 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.260
 play even stronger support 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.630
 in number, because we need it 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.070
 actually every other point around 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.160
 actually reach the relegation 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.160
 can
