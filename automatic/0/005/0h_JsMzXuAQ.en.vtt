 about the experiences that you have been able to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.740
 share so far with your new 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.780
 teammate nico hülkenberg in

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.150

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.530
 good showed his new shirt that is the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.810
 new uniform of this new team 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.310
 with your sponsor too and we 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.170
 He talked about the changes that will happen 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.230
 in cars for this new 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.290
 2014 season 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.430
 the effort of your mythical plane around 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.430
 they relate many 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:50.090
 but it's practically the culture 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.090
 British who has worked with him 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.310
 It is a culture that supports and 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.350
 is going well I understand well with them and what 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.350
 little to work with the team 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.569
 with the team and obviously our 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.330
 Our goal as a team is to have the 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.990
 better report it for the rest of the team 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.570
 but what do we have 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.710
 in question of pilots no doubt one of 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.460
 the best couples 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.890
 juanito me this season because 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.770
 I think I can do a great job to 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.890
 take the team to have the behavior 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.090
 History test is difficult 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.840
 anticipate something obviously we know 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.010
 we all know the sport that someone 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.010
 All changed 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960
 with the new engines 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.489
 graphically speaking then I think 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.489
 who is going to be a boss 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.660
 a very special one especially from the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.820
 always complicated 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.820
 but very interesting 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.569
 the first race 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:38.469
 for this changing young man I would like 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.359
 know if the collection of objects from 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.909
 cruises for the auction of its foundation 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:49.959
 has encouraged other pilots to create their 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:52.950
 foundation supports that more engineers from 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.950
 first year 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.700
 and in the end all are human 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.219
 then for me one of the reasons that 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.239
 exists in relation as early as 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.919
 possible of my career because I do not take advantage 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.739
 my careers that has given me so much 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:20.090
 arrive 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.039
 and this year we have very important things 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.560
 the foundation of Levante very interesting 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.560
 half-themed 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.250
 I passed by Miami came to this great 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.580
 great friends and one of them was the 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:40.320
 doctor here who is a person which 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.150
 he estimated a lot and outlined me when he 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.050
 have a month's vacation and that doctor 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.020
 dedicate and lizarte to do surgeries without 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.690
 no cost and better where the project and 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.110

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.750

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.890

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.280
 story no but more than that means 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.130
 very much for me I hope I can help 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.770
