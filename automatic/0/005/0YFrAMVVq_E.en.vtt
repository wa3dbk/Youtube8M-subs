00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you see there with the you know that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
you see there with the you know that
rubble<00:01:37.799> falling<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.579> he<00:01:38.670> blows<00:01:38.909> up

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
rubble falling down and then he blows up

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
rubble falling down and then he blows up
this<00:01:39.210> pillar<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.770> they're<00:01:40.920> gonna

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this pillar right here so they're gonna

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
this pillar right here so they're gonna
up<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> ante<00:01:41.970> probably<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> destruction

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
up the ante probably on the destruction

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.539 
up the ante probably on the destruction
side<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> things<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.130> think<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> lot<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
side of things because I think a lot of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.190 
side of things because I think a lot of
people<00:01:44.640> were<00:01:44.939> disappointed<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.899> bit<00:01:46.020> in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
people were disappointed a little bit in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.960 
people were disappointed a little bit in
battlefield<00:01:47.040> 3<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> amount<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
battlefield 3 on the amount of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.149 
battlefield 3 on the amount of
destruction<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.470> throughout<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
destruction that was was throughout the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
destruction that was was throughout the
maps<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.610> expected<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.630> more<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
maps they expected it to be a lot more a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
maps they expected it to be a lot more a
lot<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.740> people<00:01:52.950> even<00:01:53.070> said<00:01:53.399> hey<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
lot of people even said hey you know it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.940 
lot of people even said hey you know it
was<00:01:54.270> less<00:01:54.509> destruction<00:01:55.110> than<00:01:55.229> bad<00:01:55.409> company<00:01:55.799> 2

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
was less destruction than bad company 2

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.429 
was less destruction than bad company 2
so<00:01:56.759> they're<00:01:56.880> gonna<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.240> ante<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so they're gonna up the ante on that and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.780 
so they're gonna up the ante on that and
they're<00:01:58.590> also<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> make<00:01:59.369> him<00:01:59.520> look<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
they're also going to make him look a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.490 
they're also going to make him look a
little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.210> sharper<00:02:00.719> graphically<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
little bit more sharper graphically and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170 
little bit more sharper graphically and
stuff<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.979> I'm<00:02:02.640> sure<00:02:02.909> they'll<00:02:03.090> make

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
stuff like that I'm sure they'll make

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.340 
stuff like that I'm sure they'll make
some<00:02:03.390> other<00:02:03.540> tweaks<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.079> there<00:02:04.229> but

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
some other tweaks here and there but

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.780 
some other tweaks here and there but
essentially<00:02:05.009> these<00:02:05.130> maps<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> be

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
essentially these maps are going to be

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.809 
essentially these maps are going to be
the<00:02:05.880> 4<00:02:06.149> most<00:02:06.509> popular<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.259> by<00:02:08.129> most<00:02:08.340> popular<00:02:08.789> I

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the 4 most popular and by most popular I

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.550 
the 4 most popular and by most popular I
don't<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.569> means<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.020> most<00:02:10.200> played

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
don't know if that means the most played

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.589 
don't know if that means the most played
because<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:11.099> often<00:02:11.250> release<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.030> stats<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
because they often release the stats of

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.140 
because they often release the stats of
which

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
which

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.880 
which
maps<00:02:13.329> are<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.599> most<00:02:13.750> played<00:02:14.049> on<00:02:14.200> each<00:02:14.349> console

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
maps are the most played on each console

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.039 
maps are the most played on each console
and<00:02:15.129> even<00:02:15.400> pc<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.629> see<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.930> know

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
and even pc and you can see you know

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.780 
and even pc and you can see you know
what<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.500> community<00:02:17.680> really<00:02:18.159> likes<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.610> play

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
what the community really likes to play

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.569 
what the community really likes to play
and<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.170> was<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.379> betting<00:02:20.650> man<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.069> would<00:02:21.280> say

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
and if I was a betting man I would say

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.640 
and if I was a betting man I would say
we<00:02:21.760> were<00:02:21.879> definitely<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.659> see<00:02:22.870> Metro

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.679 
we were definitely going to see Metro
return<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.310> mean<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.549> don't<00:02:24.640> see<00:02:25.000> how<00:02:25.269> we<00:02:25.329> would

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
return I mean I don't see how we would

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.009 
return I mean I don't see how we would
have<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.959> battlefield<00:02:26.530> 3<00:02:27.010> inspired<00:02:27.780> DLC<00:02:28.780> pack

canals<00:02:46.780> TDM<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.859> i'm<00:02:47.950> really<00:02:48.269> guessing<00:02:49.269> that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
canals TDM so i'm really guessing that

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.089 
canals TDM so i'm really guessing that
metro<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.170> definitely<00:02:50.560> going<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.769> be<00:02:50.859> one<00:02:51.069> of

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
metro is definitely going to be one of

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.580 
metro is definitely going to be one of
the<00:02:51.190> maps<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:51.909> that<00:02:52.510> leads<00:02:52.750> me<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.079> think<00:02:53.230> what

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
the maps but that leads me to think what

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.170 
the maps but that leads me to think what
are<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.769> other<00:02:53.920> three<00:02:54.250> maps<00:02:54.549> going<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.909> be<00:02:55.000> are

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
are the other three maps going to be are

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180 
are the other three maps going to be are
we<00:02:55.389> going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.750> get<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.440> know<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.859> from<00:02:57.010> each

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
we going to get you know one from each

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280 
we going to get you know one from each
dlc<00:02:57.730> maybe<00:02:58.030> we'll<00:02:58.239> get<00:02:58.389> one<00:02:58.629> from<00:02:58.780> aftermath

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
dlc maybe we'll get one from aftermath

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.589 
dlc maybe we'll get one from aftermath
one<00:02:59.560> from<00:02:59.739> close<00:02:59.950> quarters<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.450> one

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.330 
one from close quarters and the one
thing<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.840> did<00:03:02.019> notice<00:03:02.049> about<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.739> multiplayer

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340

what I thought close quarters is going
to<00:03:07.000> play<00:03:07.150> like<00:03:07.359> when<00:03:08.109> I<00:03:08.139> first<00:03:08.349> heard<00:03:08.530> about

to play like when I first heard about
close<00:03:08.920> quarters<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.400> all<00:03:09.609> right<00:03:09.730> yeah<00:03:09.909> level

close quarters like all right yeah level

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.910 
close quarters like all right yeah level
of<00:03:10.420> fighting<00:03:10.569> with<00:03:10.870> some<00:03:11.079> outside<00:03:11.439> areas<00:03:11.799> that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
of fighting with some outside areas that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.080 
of fighting with some outside areas that
are<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> little<00:03:12.159> bit<00:03:12.310> more<00:03:12.430> spread<00:03:12.760> out<00:03:12.790> but

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
are a little bit more spread out but

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.369 
are a little bit more spread out but
once<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.359> go<00:03:13.480> into<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.750> buildings<00:03:14.139> are<00:03:14.290> gonna

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
once you go into the buildings are gonna

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.710 
once you go into the buildings are gonna
be<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.560> lot<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.129> down<00:03:15.340> fighting<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.599> when

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
be a lot of up and down fighting so when

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.360 
be a lot of up and down fighting so when
I<00:03:16.780> watch<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.230> sounds<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.590> wow<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:18.069> this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
I watch this sounds like wow this this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.619 
I watch this sounds like wow this this
is<00:03:18.489> what<00:03:18.669> close<00:03:18.910> quarters<00:03:19.239> should<00:03:19.359> have<00:03:19.480> been

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
is what close quarters should have been

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.720 
is what close quarters should have been
and<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.560> makes<00:03:20.769> me<00:03:20.919> think<00:03:21.160> hey<00:03:21.370> are<00:03:21.609> they

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
and that makes me think hey are they

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.979 
and that makes me think hey are they
going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> maybe<00:03:22.209> take<00:03:22.480> some<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.840> close

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
going to maybe take some of the close

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.330 
going to maybe take some of the close
quarters<00:03:23.230> maps<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.739> expand<00:03:24.040> them<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> little

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
quarters maps and expand them a little

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.039 
quarters maps and expand them a little
bit<00:03:24.519> maybe<00:03:24.970> that'll<00:03:25.269> be<00:03:25.389> one<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.690> maps<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
bit maybe that'll be one of the maps it

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.110 
bit maybe that'll be one of the maps it
comes<00:03:26.199> back<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.799> would<00:03:27.790> say<00:03:27.970> they're

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
comes back but I would say they're

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.309 
comes back but I would say they're
probably<00:03:28.329> going<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.629> keep<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.139> the

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
probably going to keep to the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.740 
probably going to keep to the
battlefield<00:03:30.040> 3<00:03:30.400> vanilla<00:03:30.819> maps<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.329> don't<00:03:31.510> know

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
battlefield 3 vanilla maps I don't know

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.869 
battlefield 3 vanilla maps I don't know
if<00:03:31.930> they'll<00:03:32.109> they'll<00:03:32.379> dabble<00:03:32.829> in<00:03:32.949> the<00:03:33.069> dlc<00:03:33.609> I

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
if they'll they'll dabble in the dlc I

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.789 
if they'll they'll dabble in the dlc I
would<00:03:34.329> love<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.659> see<00:03:34.930> some<00:03:35.079> aftermath<00:03:35.530> Maps

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
would love to see some aftermath Maps

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
return if that's going to be the case

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.330 
return if that's going to be the case
because<00:03:37.720> those<00:03:38.079> maps<00:03:38.319> are<00:03:38.530> still<00:03:38.829> pretty<00:03:39.069> new

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
because those maps are still pretty new

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.819 
because those maps are still pretty new
I<00:03:39.370> mean<00:03:39.699> since<00:03:40.599> they've<00:03:40.780> only<00:03:40.959> been<00:03:41.199> out<00:03:41.349> since

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
I mean since they've only been out since

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.680 
I mean since they've only been out since
December<00:03:42.549> they<00:03:42.760> still<00:03:43.060> kind<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.299> have<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.449> fresh

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
December they still kind of have a fresh

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.259 
December they still kind of have a fresh
field<00:03:44.079> Who<00:03:44.229> am<00:03:44.379> I<00:03:44.500> guess<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.879> wouldn't<00:03:46.150> be

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
field Who am I guess so it wouldn't be

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.780 
field Who am I guess so it wouldn't be
as<00:03:46.449> bad<00:03:46.479> as<00:03:46.930> getting<00:03:47.139> metro<00:03:48.069> back<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.699> you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
as bad as getting metro back and you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.909 
as bad as getting metro back and you
know<00:03:48.879> nose<00:03:49.090> hair<00:03:49.299> canals<00:03:49.629> but<00:03:49.959> I'm<00:03:50.739> guessing

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
know nose hair canals but I'm guessing

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.379 
know nose hair canals but I'm guessing
they're<00:03:51.190> gonna<00:03:51.280> stick<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.729> the<00:03:51.849> vanilla<00:03:52.120> maps

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
they're gonna stick to the vanilla maps

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.180 
they're gonna stick to the vanilla maps
so<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.720> leads<00:03:52.900> me<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.260> my<00:03:53.290> next<00:03:53.470> point<00:03:53.829> is

so that leads me to my next point is

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.399 
so that leads me to my next point is
which<00:03:54.879> maps<00:03:55.269> do<00:03:55.479> you<00:03:55.569> guys<00:03:55.780> want<00:03:56.139> to<00:03:56.260> see

think<00:04:38.140> some<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> consoles<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:39.340> like<00:04:39.610> to

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
think some of the consoles they like to

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.090 
think some of the consoles they like to
they<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.840> mix<00:04:41.110> things<00:04:41.290> up<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.710> tedium

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
they like to mix things up on tedium

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.220 
they like to mix things up on tedium
because<00:04:42.280> TDM<00:04:42.640> is<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.850> popular<00:04:43.210> game<00:04:43.690> mode<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.200> I

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
because TDM is a popular game mode and I

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.510 
because TDM is a popular game mode and I
think<00:04:44.470> that's<00:04:44.650> kind<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:44.950> what<00:04:45.130> skews<00:04:45.490> the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
think that's kind of what skews the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.550 
think that's kind of what skews the
stats<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.090> little<00:04:46.330> bit<00:04:46.450> because<00:04:47.170> I<00:04:47.320> think<00:04:47.380> if

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
stats a little bit because I think if

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320 
stats a little bit because I think if
you<00:04:47.650> really<00:04:47.980> sat<00:04:48.220> down<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.460> went<00:04:48.790> in-depth

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
you really sat down and went in-depth

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.790 
you really sat down and went in-depth
into<00:04:49.630> it<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:49.840> would<00:04:49.960> see<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.140> nose<00:04:50.560> hair

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
into it you would see that nose hair

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.860 
into it you would see that nose hair

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
cool I already mentioned I thought it'd

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.170
