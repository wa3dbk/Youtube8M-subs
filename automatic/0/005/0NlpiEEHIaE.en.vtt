land it is is that i'm just going to be
doing<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.670> few<00:01:20.880> examples<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.420> australia

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
doing a few examples just australia

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:34.960 
doing a few examples just australia
what's<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.259> like

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.240 

so<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> chicken<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.080> fairly<00:01:37.590> basic<00:01:37.800> move

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so the chicken is a fairly basic move
