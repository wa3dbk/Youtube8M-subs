00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:15.610
 This is Corolla's beauty . 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.199
 an unbearable fault 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:24.580
 and accelerating is apparently looked 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:27.759
 coil sail some problem like that 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 only when analyzing the nozzles 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.940
 we realized that you are having a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.010
 very large difference from nozzle to nozzle 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:54.579
 show you back here at the machine back 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:57.150
 to take a 3/3 test with the two 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.150
 or less here 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 joÃ£o braga wins difference that the ong 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.460
 bull 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.080
 you can make a difference 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.530
 the first and second he thought of 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.530
 neighborhood 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.370
 look at the difference 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.790
 the first one is 55 ml second is with 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.800
 58 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:08.209
 the third is 49 and a fourth is 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.009
 with 38 already doing the cleaning now and then 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.910
 us back to show how are 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.890
 the bits is more the staff coming back here 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.150
 there are nozzles that we had made the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.890
 cleaning 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.670
 Let's see how the equalization gets. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.670
 two nozzles 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.920
 video fault 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.490
 I was going to be the one to find him. 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490
 inverted image 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.640
 highlighting that many people say that 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.160
 Nozzle and balloon company operates under the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.860
 effect of mechanical money but in 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.720
 truth is solving the problem in 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.790
 instead of changing the spent spout 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.660
 money we do the proper cleaning 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.660
 the same 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.360
 already rafael beautiful difference from the river 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.460
 all the same 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.640
 That's it, everybody equalizes only until the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.640
 next video
