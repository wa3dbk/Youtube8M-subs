chain oil and fuel to your gas chainsaw
so<00:00:15.780> first<00:00:16.080> let's<00:00:16.940> let's<00:00:17.940> mix<00:00:18.210> our<00:00:18.359> gas<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.010> oil

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
so first let's let's mix our gas and oil

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.570 
so first let's let's mix our gas and oil
mixture<00:00:21.380> this<00:00:22.380> particular<00:00:22.890> gas<00:00:23.039> cans<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> two

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
mixture this particular gas cans a two

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
mixture this particular gas cans a two
gallon<00:00:23.910> gas<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.600> want<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> fill<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
gallon gas can we want to fill it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.839 
gallon gas can we want to fill it
halfway<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:26.580> fuel<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.260> then<00:00:28.260> add<00:00:28.470> two<00:00:29.250> two

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
halfway with fuel and then add two two

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.979 
halfway with fuel and then add two two
point<00:00:30.090> six<00:00:30.920> two-stroke<00:00:31.920> oil<00:00:32.130> containers<00:00:32.989> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
point six two-stroke oil containers so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
point six two-stroke oil containers so
one<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.410> two<00:00:34.860> point<00:00:35.130> six<00:00:35.340> container<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:36.540> mix

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
one two two point six container will mix

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
one two two point six container will mix
one<00:00:36.960> gallon<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> fuel<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.190> case<00:00:38.430> we're

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
one gallon of fuel so in this case we're

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
one gallon of fuel so in this case we're
going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> need<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> these<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> let's<00:00:40.739> add

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
going to need two of these so let's add

00:00:40.920 --> 00:01:01.380 
going to need two of these so let's add
our<00:00:40.980> two-stroke<00:00:41.520> mixture

has<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.530> oil<00:01:41.710> on<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.369> chain<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.780> next<00:01:43.960> let's

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
has the oil on the chain so next let's

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.760 
has the oil on the chain so next let's
fuel<00:01:44.530> up<00:01:44.680> our<00:01:44.860> chainsaw<00:01:45.960> first<00:01:46.960> let's<00:01:47.170> put<00:01:47.380> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
fuel up our chainsaw first let's put the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.859 
fuel up our chainsaw first let's put the
two-stroke<00:01:48.220> gas<00:01:48.460> mixture<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:54.869> always

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
two-stroke gas mixture in it always

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.600 
two-stroke gas mixture in it always
remember<00:01:56.470> not<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.800> overfill<00:01:57.220> your<00:01:57.250> gas<00:01:57.580> tank

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
remember not to overfill your gas tank

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:10.770 
remember not to overfill your gas tank
you<00:01:58.090> never<00:01:58.270> want<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.540> have<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> spill

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
there's no need to use the choke so the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.789 
there's no need to use the choke so the
same<00:04:16.850> position<00:04:17.850> still<00:04:18.480> applies<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.650> your
