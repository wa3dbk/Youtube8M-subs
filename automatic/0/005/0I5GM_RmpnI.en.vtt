00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 very good to everyone today true that 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.049
 We are in minecraft 1.6 point 2 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.660
 let's see a very cool way but very 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.370
 very very very cool apologize I can not 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.490
 scream a lot because it's night 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.500
 for a change yes I know but good is that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.859
 I did not have another moment to record to see 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.640
 let's do there are three storage rooms is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.699
 this here with one of wool in the middle 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.310
 transandino fight frame we do this like this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.310
 and so on and one of each means 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.200
 what we put together is a motorbike 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.720
 ni ni 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.720
 listen to the noise 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.640
 if you do not listen very well 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.430
 it's a little more 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.710
 it sounds like a motorcycle 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.260
 and on the way back down is that it works 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.550
 a very strange way this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.550
 it is still listening just as strong 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.909
 it's a very strange thing but very good 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.170
 I can take all this away 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.170
 that keeps listening 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.850
 I do not understand this is the super moto is 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.340
 pretty cool 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 and you can see it on the side like that a little bit 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 but very little 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.980
 down 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.890
 you see that you hear super strong from 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.950
 good blow I'm listening to it super 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.950
 strong do not know what to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.930
 but it's very cool I had to remove 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.240
 the sound from the windows itself I do not know 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.369
 I do not understand why 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.780
 the issue of this is that if we put it in 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.800
 crisis 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.360
 disappears 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.590
 so I guess I will have done 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.420
 like a bug not 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.230
 get a bug from the bad guys because the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 peaceful animal horses do not pass them 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.330
 I do not know very well but we're going to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.000
 put on the super motorcycle and here we have 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.049
 chan chan chan chan chan my super 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.150
 dose motocross circuit is 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.910
 pretty hard 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.480
 this bores me many times I know we go 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.480
 Approve 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.370
 I'm super smart 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.830
 to them 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.040
 now 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.160
 let's go to it triki triki burrum burrum 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.520
 burrum burrum the motorcycle as you remove the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.520
 sounds 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.579
 Spanish water 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.469
 and it goes up well it's super cool 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.700
 some really liked I say it let's go 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.700
 put it in the third person 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.750
 and that is one of the things that most 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.790
 like man what he does is build the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.570
 truth is that I do not always have the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.300
 opportunity or when I do not like to be 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.620
 here the fact I all complicated yes 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.370
 because I've done it and half done 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.370
 super complicated 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.240
 there is careful care 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.590
 i 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.150
 with careful we still do not kill 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.340
 I like to build up the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.710
 wall that normally, well, if I'm 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.780
 recording and that I do not like to lose 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.890
 so much time building on this for 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.780
 example is very cool this put 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.090
 simply so that it feels like a 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.350
 block only one but the most 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.350
 automatically two I already think it was 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.110
 I thought it was weird you can not jump in 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.330
 swims with the bike but climbs a block 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.459
 automatic then this is cool because they are 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.080
 pistons that rise and your mass and 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.080
 arrives arrives 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.990
 and we are going to finish the super circuit here 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.000
 put the bullet had put by here to the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.660
 end of the removed because I'm stupid and 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.660
 I knew I was going to fall 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 d 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.210
 that float in the lava walks in the lava 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.240
 so so so so so so so so 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.780
 because the lava walks 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.780
 my god 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.680
 I do not understand very well how it goes but well 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:47.089
 or 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:54.509
 the description of geox comfort is 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:58.180
 I can facilitate yale if you want yours 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.090
 supermoto that sometimes moves alone 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.880
 a little weird 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.050
 before getting her to move alone 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.120
 look 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.819
 this bike is crazy to point and a 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.009
 red as if it were a bug 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:15.419
 but I hope you liked it already 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.419
 you know favorites that heap 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.840
 bye
