00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.160
 we will only learn how to use the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.039
 first batter than the batter 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 batsman he serves to fight the light 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.689
 Do you want to reflect somewhere else? 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.730
 then be a light antonia of the sun be 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.570
 another light source has to be 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.099
 a flash 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 no matter the batter serves only 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.400
 to counteract the light and direct another 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 place 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 this is a hitter that everybody 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.860
 what work with foto do you know none 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.260
 51 hitter like that that hitter him 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 comes double inside a wine case 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.789
 at the time you take it out 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.219
 it opened so that the barred 2009 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.730
 then this batsman has some 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.640
 faces right it is one meter and twenty this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.930
 here is how you use then you have a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 white side 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.070
 you have a golden side 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.000
 By the time I take off his cloak, I have 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.000
 always here 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.229
 I still have the weak side and one side 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.869
 black that you do not feel the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.540
 reflect all the works around the world 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.149
 so just so you understand this should 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.380
 work as long as you close here as the 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.380
 people are going to use a little corner 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.060
 Thomas and possible care 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.250
 in an article the time you 're catching 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.090
 sun heels fine in my direction 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.189
 left 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.280
 If I take this from here, look at the 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.490
 brightness that will give in the filming not only of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 hit the sun will then just doing 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.130
 this model here folks you are 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.740
 throwing a light there is more lps than changing 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.560
 if I make a white side myself 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.860
 I can also rebut this here generate a 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.500
 interesting fight then the batter you 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.289
 Will you be able to make a golden light? 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.489
 to make a human light silver 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.010
 Bank 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.620
 so here you have these 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.329
 four stages for you to use now 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.260
 something else that is interesting here 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:27.910
 at the time you take off this cape you at 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.530
 truth has a diffuser also come here 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.440
 a little just to show how 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.380
 everything works so you have it here 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.660
 path is in the sun that is if 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.430
 take a picture here is to leave with a lot of 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.090
 shadow would not be able to look and everything 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.609
 more 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.680
 at the time I use the diffuser I put 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:49.209
 here it looks like it stays 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.340
 In other words, direct sunlight is 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.940
 diffuser so by the time you think 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.280
 this here turns a diffuse light source 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.950
 so you can take your picture of 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.019
 a much cooler way if the relationship 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.180
 the harsh under the eye and everything 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.520
 then teacher says that you can not 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.900
 do no picture of the day 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.940
 so fixed here 3rd places the photo takes 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.800
 someone to help you make a diffuser 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.320
 put it looks like mine could not 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.030
 to be recording the video so the logic 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.610
 to be weird, my 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.430
 Ensures that the business having child you 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.040
 I could make it look like it's now 15 to 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.840
 One day I was going to talk, I did not go. 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.850
 photograph this time here because 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.040
 give a touch of the look here oh souza 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.400
 diffuser like I'm in the filming 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.280
 Look how I was here, you can 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.680
 yes you just want to make beauty 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.370

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.960
 80 cruise there until 1 130 you buy one 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.370
