00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.630
 how to flash a reflex camera on 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.710
 example 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:24.269
 1000d at the moment the camera 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:26.449
 worth firmware 10 with something now i have it 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.449
 will demonstrate 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:43.270
 10 thousand 11 worth it was born on it 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:47.120
 focuses 103 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.120
 I found the internet firmware 107 now 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 I want to put on his chest that for this 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.590
 we need we need a memory card capacity 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.260
 from 512 to 4 gigabyte card reader and 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.980
 actually the camera itself 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.330
 go to leave support crane 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.420
 download the firmware and refer to us below 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.320
 in the description of the firmware install on 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.119
 memory card 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:19.330
 I have 4 gigabytes, I donâ€™t know 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:22.330
 do not pull now turn off the camera 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 turn on 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.830
 and now 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.340
 now also go menu 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.120
 here he offers us to replace push 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120
 ok 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.690
 here it is 107 we choose I went to the process 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.190
 process firmware reversible you always 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.380
 you can roll back to any previous 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.780
 firmware and even unsuccessful case 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.150
 firmware is okay with the device is not 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.770
 will be home cameras to find out 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.090
 already 5 years but of course technology is already 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.520
 outdated but makes a very good frame 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 And in the new firmware it is written that they changed 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.310
 white balance ratio added new 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.410
 processing functions 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:57.740
 images but video recording functions so 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:03.110
 neither appeared nor appear unfortunately 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.110
 and the video shoot the moment on canon 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.690
 650d 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.900
 Of course the camera is completely different to 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.910
 us class then there are thousands of yes it generally 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.380
 the initial carcass is also considered to be 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.550
 amateur dash pro 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.550
 semi-professional transitional model 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.840
 then 1000 d we have 10 megapixels three 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.580
 frames per second 650 and we have five and five 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.239
 frames per second and 18 megapixels 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.239
 that is, almost twice 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.140
 so the firmware almost stopped 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:10.909
 one at all became well at first glance 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:16.489
 so far but nothing is noticeable of course 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:20.400
 some new features try poyuzay 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.820
 Unsubscribe than replaced by all thanks for 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.820
