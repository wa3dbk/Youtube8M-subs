I'm<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:13.799> sure<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.040> might<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.400> being<00:00:14.580> too

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

optimistic<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.750> think<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.500> might<00:00:16.830> be<00:00:17.160> about

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
optimistic but I think we might be about

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.939 
optimistic but I think we might be about
to<00:00:17.789> enter<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.359> phase<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:19.050> humanity<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:19.830> we

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
to enter a phase in humanity where we

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.080 
to enter a phase in humanity where we
start<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> take<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> little<00:00:20.730> bit<00:00:20.910> more

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
start to take a little bit more

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.290 
start to take a little bit more
responsibility<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.400> many

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
centuries of neglecting the earth it's
that<00:00:26.910> weird<00:00:27.180> thing<00:00:27.480> where<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> tiniest

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that weird thing where just the tiniest

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
that weird thing where just the tiniest
little<00:00:28.890> thing<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.760> choices<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.179> make

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
little thing the little choices you make

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.730 
little thing the little choices you make
every<00:00:30.570> day<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.260> big<00:00:31.380> impact

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
every day can have a really big impact

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.130 
every day can have a really big impact
on<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.850> beautiful<00:00:33.270> creatures<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.719> Tiger

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
on on beautiful creatures like Tiger

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
on on beautiful creatures like Tiger
just<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> way<00:00:34.800> Gulf<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> friendly<00:00:35.520> tuna<00:00:35.760> took

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.020 
just the way Gulf and friendly tuna took
off<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.329> palm<00:00:36.989> oil<00:00:37.230> free<00:00:37.620> food<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.520> take

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
when they make it they kill tigers which

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.290 
when they make it they kill tigers which
is<00:00:46.020> bad<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.160> traditionally<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.059> think

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
is bad right and traditionally I think

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
is bad right and traditionally I think
targets<00:00:48.600> had<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> bad<00:00:48.960> rap<00:00:49.230> sheet<00:00:50.010> Khan<00:00:50.280> from
