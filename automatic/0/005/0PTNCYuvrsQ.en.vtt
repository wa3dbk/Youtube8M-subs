 Today tavares do the review of the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.600
 book the guardian of nicolas sparks 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.130

 I order it from her 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.690
 Custom is a puppy , right? 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:42.269
 hence the time passes there is a temporal jump 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 in history is enough to find a new 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.980
 love is not to recreate her life and she 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.200
 starts making a series of meetings is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 with your partner, but you do not 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.899
 very sure 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.230
 She knows an engineer and a man. 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 It's very beautiful, he 's very late. 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.940
 well then she has everything she wanted in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.619
 name and begins to fall in love with him 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.470
 begins to get involved with it 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.259
 only at the same time that this occurs is 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.990
 mike is her best friend since 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:21.360
 childhood she starts to feel very 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.789
 next to it then begins to feel that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.399
 He's more wants to be more than a friend. 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.560
 for her and she does not know what she feels 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.240
 certain by him then logically divided 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.429
 between the river and the sea 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 after all this situation in which she 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.520
 you see yourself in the middle of a love triangle is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.280
 it starts to affect the garbage some 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.399
 abrupt changes of a new one it starts to 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 see that he is not so the perfect man 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.670
 What she was thinking is that he has 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 some food problems distrust 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.149
 the back in the middle of history that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.479
 I will not say much, but until the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.380
 moment of the plot is something 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.860
 involving mike and the filling and gasoline 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.200
 Are you going to get kinda shocked at everything? 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.200
 there all that is the safe there 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.870
 good is this book it is it works 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.000
 hard and psychological of the characters 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 enough then he works a lot 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.600
 issue of mourning 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.990
 that the help passes you have to pass it 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.540
 works the question of garbage is a 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.000
 very complex character 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 It has several facets of moel I do not 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 I'm a psychologist so I do not have the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.440
 idea of ​​what goes on in his mind but 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.450
 he has several more personalities 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.970
 he probably at least for what I 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.210
 li bettencourt psychopath is a 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.440
 character that at first is the book is 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.990
 narrated by the third person but are you? 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.460
 does not know what the narrator hides 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.380
 this part of you the beginning of the book 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.140
 whole then you stay 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.090
 I hoped for the river at first but then 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.560
 What are you discovering a little more? 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.800
 the characters you will understand nothing 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.900
 better than the very work 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.050
 Psychological people and a risk one 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.959
 very good space is not the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.660
 first book he 's the side 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.940
 of the characters in the middle of the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.430
 story and he did it very well. 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.650
 remembered the book is now a road 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:45.480
 very well too 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:51.840
 the guardian has a history and 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:04:05.459
 main characters is his life in 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:13.950
 risk the risk is much too complicated 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:22.410
 good very good and good is psychological of the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:24.830
 characters was not a book I did not 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.069
 I know if it was because I read 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.349
 on top is much later so there are two 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.810
 weeks after entering a curve in the 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.729
 road and the nicolas books part of the 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.479
 citizen thinks big 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.729
 at least 23 months in or any other 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.770
 besides the two is very close in 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.810
 treatment in joaçaba a little of the 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.669
 narrative Sunday they do it and I do 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.189
 I also thought this part of suspense 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.530
 with much better infinitely better in 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:05:02.210
 a curve in the road making a number 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:05:04.969
 very good on the river 4 6 and 6 3 and 6 1 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.340
 lately it is also one of the spears of 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:12.259
 2010 the guardian tires 2013 2012 and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.780
 It has lately added the element 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.699
 think in the middle of his dramas in a 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.620
 curve on the road is practically a book 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.620
 police officer 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.719
 With that, he does not finish the census. 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.090
 making him so strong that he turned 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.419
 a police book is not it a book is 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.830
 a drama with touches of suspense and 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.039
 mystery in the middle 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:06:00.469
 it remains a drama the end is 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:06:04.729
 predictable is quite a lot of the year in the 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:15.740
 My evaluation of the good for everyone 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:34.969
 who have a terminal illness and person 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:37.180
 die that is always a little more is good 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.889
 That's it.
