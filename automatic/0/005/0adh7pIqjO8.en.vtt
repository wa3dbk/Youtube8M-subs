hi<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.290> in<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:01.949> video<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.429> wanted<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> show

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi guys in this video I wanted to show

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.140 
hi guys in this video I wanted to show
you<00:00:03.570> how<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.350> measure<00:00:04.740> your<00:00:04.980> amplifier<00:00:05.790> power

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
you how to measure your amplifier power

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.720 
you how to measure your amplifier power
without<00:00:06.930> making<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.740> noise<00:00:07.770> with<00:00:08.700> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
without making a noise with a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.570 
without making a noise with a
traditional<00:00:09.389> speaker<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:10.950> when

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
traditional speaker like this one when

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.330 
traditional speaker like this one when
you<00:00:11.670> leave<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> normal<00:00:12.599> flat<00:00:12.860> like<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.099> one

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
you leave a normal flat like this one

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.840 
you leave a normal flat like this one
and<00:00:15.089> you've<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.870> neighbors<00:00:16.080> all<00:00:16.590> around<00:00:16.949> you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and you've got neighbors all around you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.759 
and you've got neighbors all around you
just<00:00:18.119> cannot<00:00:18.600> start<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> measurement<00:00:20.090> like

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
just cannot start the measurement like

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.060 
just cannot start the measurement like
then<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.010> plug<00:00:23.910> cuz<00:00:24.510> you'll<00:00:24.779> bring<00:00:25.560> pulleys

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
then a plug cuz you'll bring pulleys

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.480 
then a plug cuz you'll bring pulleys
pretty<00:00:26.430> quickly<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.109> how<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.560> what

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
pretty quickly so how you do this what

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.549 
pretty quickly so how you do this what
you<00:00:29.640> need<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.000> actually<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:31.579> multimeter

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
you need is actually a multimeter

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.470 
you need is actually a multimeter
standard<00:00:34.559> stuff

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
standard stuff

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.139 
standard stuff
nothing<00:00:36.480> fancy<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.129> use<00:00:38.460> all

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
nothing fancy this is what you use all

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.650 
nothing fancy this is what you use all
the<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.980> measurement<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.940> instead<00:00:42.450> of

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the time for measurement but instead of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
the time for measurement but instead of
this<00:00:43.230> speaker<00:00:44.059> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:46.100> things<00:00:47.100> like

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
this speaker you can use things like

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.209 
this speaker you can use things like
this<00:00:48.379> this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.559> called<00:00:49.820> dummy<00:00:50.820> load<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:52.219> this

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this this is called dummy load and this

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.689 
this this is called dummy load and this
is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> set<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.910> resistors<00:00:54.420> joined<00:00:55.350> together<00:00:55.699> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
is a set of resistors joined together to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.189 
is a set of resistors joined together to
bring<00:00:57.440> eight<00:00:58.440> arms<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
bring eight arms here so actually it is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.759 
bring eight arms here so actually it is
a<00:01:01.379> good<00:01:02.129> substitute<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.199> course

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
a good substitute of this one of course

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
a good substitute of this one of course
for<00:01:05.250> measurement<00:01:05.930> moreover<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.170> traditional

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
for measurement moreover a traditional

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.500 
for measurement moreover a traditional
speaker<00:01:08.430> cannot<00:01:09.180> give<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.250> constant

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
speaker cannot give you a constant

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
speaker cannot give you a constant
resistance<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:14.369> whole<00:01:14.580> frequency

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
resistance over the whole frequency

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.710 
resistance over the whole frequency
range

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
range

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
range
it<00:01:16.470> starts<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.939> resistance<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.890> low

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it starts with one resistance at the low

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.149 
it starts with one resistance at the low
end<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.820> frequency<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.020> play<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
end of frequency you play and it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.120 
end of frequency you play and it
finishes<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> same<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.049> other<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.530> at

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
finishes with the same the other one at

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.950 
finishes with the same the other one at
the<00:01:26.460> high<00:01:26.670> frequency<00:01:27.420> range<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.729> your

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the high frequency range so your

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
the high frequency range so your
measurement<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.470> vary<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:32.270> frequency<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
measurement will vary on frequency you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.020 
measurement will vary on frequency you
use<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.259> amplifier<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
use in your amplifier for the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.390 
use in your amplifier for the
measurement<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
measurement this is not not going to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.060 
measurement this is not not going to
happen<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.939> traditional<00:01:39.450> register<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
happen with a traditional register it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
happen with a traditional register it
gives<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> resistance<00:01:42.210> no<00:01:42.450> matter<00:01:42.659> what

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
gives the resistance no matter what

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.310 
gives the resistance no matter what
frequency<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.610> amplified<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
frequency you are amplified with this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.010 
frequency you are amplified with this
guy<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.590> how<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.860> okay<00:01:51.020> first

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
guy here so how do you do it okay first

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
guy here so how do you do it okay first
of<00:01:52.259> all<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> set<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.360> multimeter

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
of all you have to set your multimeter

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:05.590 
of all you have to set your multimeter
for<00:01:57.799> AC<00:02:00.079> secondly<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:02.070> hook<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:03.560> your

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
for AC secondly you hook up your your

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.669 
for AC secondly you hook up your your
dummy<00:02:06.600> load<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> output<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> your

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
dummy load to the output of your

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.460 
dummy load to the output of your
amplifier<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:12.270> gonna<00:02:12.540> connect

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
amplifier so I'm gonna connect

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.230 
amplifier so I'm gonna connect
these<00:02:13.650> guys<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:14.910> together<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:16.590> make<00:02:17.240> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
these guys here all together to make the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.720 
these guys here all together to make the
amplifier<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> standard

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
amplifier think that the standard

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.150 
amplifier think that the standard
speaker<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.320> its<00:02:22.950> output<00:02:24.500> next<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:26.010> you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
speaker is on its output next what you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.340 
speaker is on its output next what you
need<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.520> any<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:28.730> sinus<00:02:29.730> waves

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
need is any kind of sinus waves

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.530 
need is any kind of sinus waves
generator<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.800> use<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.850> from<00:02:34.220> Rome

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
generator I use the one from Rome

generator I use the one from Rome
equalization<00:02:36.540> wizard<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.660> your

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
equalization wizard but this is of your

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.550 
equalization wizard but this is of your
choice<00:02:40.050> what<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.830> need<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:42.560> to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
choice what you need is actually to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.780 
choice what you need is actually to
generate<00:02:43.740> 50<00:02:44.670> Hertz<00:02:45.350> seen<00:02:46.350> wave<00:02:46.590> why<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.580> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
generate 50 Hertz seen wave why it's a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.980 
generate 50 Hertz seen wave why it's a
50<00:02:48.420> Hertz<00:02:48.570> because<00:02:49.290> most<00:02:50.270> cheap<00:02:51.270> multimeters

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
50 Hertz because most cheap multimeters

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.780 
50 Hertz because most cheap multimeters
like<00:02:52.470> mine<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:54.120> measure<00:02:54.660> voltage<00:02:55.470> only<00:02:56.190> hit

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
like mine can measure voltage only hit

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.370 
like mine can measure voltage only hit
this<00:02:57.570> frequency<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:59.840> don't<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.080> do

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
this frequency and they don't really do

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.750

when<00:03:44.850> you're<00:03:45.450> dealing<00:03:46.140> with<00:03:46.489> subwoofer

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
when you're dealing with subwoofer

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.420 
when you're dealing with subwoofer
amplifier<00:03:48.450> at<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.959> point<00:03:49.260> you're<00:03:49.890> all<00:03:50.130> set

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
amplifier at this point you're all set

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.810 
amplifier at this point you're all set
and<00:03:51.590> finally<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.890> time<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.430> take<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and finally it's time to take the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.270 
and finally it's time to take the
measurement<00:03:54.440> switch<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.650> on

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
measurement switch it on

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.500 
measurement switch it on
it<00:03:58.280> reads<00:03:58.670> twenty<00:03:59.450> volts<00:04:00.160> at<00:04:01.160> eight<00:04:01.640> arms

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
it reads twenty volts at eight arms

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.650 
it reads twenty volts at eight arms
right<00:04:03.350> switch<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.340> off<00:04:06.460> so<00:04:07.460> let's<00:04:07.970> do<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
right switch it off so let's do the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.010 
right switch it off so let's do the
mathematics<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.880> formula<00:04:11.330> for<00:04:11.540> calculating

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
mathematics the formula for calculating

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.730 
mathematics the formula for calculating
power<00:04:12.410> would<00:04:12.920> look<00:04:13.160> like<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:14.050> in<00:04:15.050> our<00:04:15.350> case

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
power would look like this in our case

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.680 
power would look like this in our case
so<00:04:18.790> we<00:04:19.790> had<00:04:20.090> like<00:04:20.330> 20<00:04:20.900> volts<00:04:21.410> at<00:04:21.590> eight<00:04:22.100> arms

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
so we had like 20 volts at eight arms

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.290 
so we had like 20 volts at eight arms
that<00:04:23.690> would<00:04:23.900> be<00:04:24.110> 400<00:04:24.980> volts<00:04:25.460> cuz<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:26.090> is

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
that would be 400 volts cuz this is

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.740 
that would be 400 volts cuz this is
square<00:04:29.530> divided<00:04:30.530> by<00:04:30.680> eight<00:04:31.220> arms<00:04:31.880> so

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
square divided by eight arms so

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.000 
square divided by eight arms so
altogether<00:04:33.230> we<00:04:33.530> get<00:04:33.980> 50<00:04:34.670> watts<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.330> power<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
altogether we get 50 watts of power the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.900 
altogether we get 50 watts of power the
producer<00:04:37.640> says<00:04:38.420> my<00:04:39.410> amplifier<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:41.320> 120<00:04:42.670> as<00:04:43.670> you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
producer says my amplifier is 120 as you

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.620 
producer says my amplifier is 120 as you
can<00:04:44.090> see<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.660> not<00:04:44.840> true<00:04:45.310> Ariel<00:04:46.310> RMS<00:04:47.300> power

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
can see this is not true Ariel RMS power

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.280 
can see this is not true Ariel RMS power
would<00:04:48.020> be<00:04:48.050> 50<00:04:48.950> watts<00:04:49.520> all<00:04:49.910> right<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.080> how

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
would be 50 watts all right this is how

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.670 
would be 50 watts all right this is how
you<00:04:51.350> do<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.740> it<00:04:52.520> gets<00:04:52.580> quite<00:04:53.090> hot<00:04:53.530> after<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
you do it it gets quite hot after the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.470 
you do it it gets quite hot after the
measurement<00:04:54.860> Wow<00:04:55.790> it's<00:04:56.420> like<00:04:57.520> 50<00:04:58.520> or<00:04:58.610> 60,000

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
measurement Wow it's like 50 or 60,000

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.690 
measurement Wow it's like 50 or 60,000
degrees
