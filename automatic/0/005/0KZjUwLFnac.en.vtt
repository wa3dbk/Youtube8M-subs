00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.519
 Welcome to the second class where you open it. 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.740
 technicians and tacticians with their 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.029
 drawings here in my gallery 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.630
 Let's start with this, here it is. 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.429
 very good design and also to look for 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.929
 money is not even coming to a 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.570
 cool finish, people will not 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.430
 resting until you get there just feel 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.990
 lack of this area here seems to be a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 hair that you did not finish 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.040
 I would like to see the finished drawing I think 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 that this is important for an analysis 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.800
 Your work is better, then it's good here. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.660
 I see in your face that it's pretty cool. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.660
 finish you built seven 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 Let's see the next one, this face I see. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.540
 that you used here the tool that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.670
 tool to duplicate nec on top or 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.670
 very good job, really cool 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 This Batman is what I told you, I feel. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 lack of feet here 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.300
 in case you want to do the feet you come 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.159
 above click on move image 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.360
 here she moves the image at the top of the hour 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.090
 of paper 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.479
 you can control oil put more or 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 less here when a space with the feet 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.760
 I'm going to create a new layer to do 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.130
 the outline fast here do first the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.870
 same 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.659
 so you can die if you do not 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.930
 not fit your design did not fit into the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.860
 sheet you can move it clicked on 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.320
 simple line but does not stop 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 finish the examples 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 the pup I really liked the finish 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.250
 The painting you did was really cool. 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.610
 here has a lower tool is a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.789
 thick brush is a tool 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.640
 From this dream, she finds a way. 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.890
 legal terms here then in this 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.680
 Puppy can paint for example here 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.050
 a stretch of brown and then go passing 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.209
 the brush to spread and I walk if it goes 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.910
 need to make the black finish that 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:30.739
 the brush effect will look really cool 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:38.360
 almost 13 attack 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:44.209
 so that 's one of the vanishing points 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.209
 red also ruler service 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.010
 put the vanishing point 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.640
 before several of them, right? 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.640
 we always make a vanishing point and one or 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.040
 two depending on the design and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.970
 I'll get the tool later. 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.900
 square to draw facade 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.459
 the tools of your tablet 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.739
 stop using the tools 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.959
 this will make your drawing better 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.010
 finished and with the most professional face 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.530
 huh 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.410
 We are here, look at how little you are 16 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.120
 tools you have available for 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.320
 that his drawing became more present 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.910
 professionally 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:43.700
 use and abuse the results this is cool 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.700
 Good, now, let's move on to a program. 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:04:02.810
 I have the idea that the two are well 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:04:02.810
 Similarities in layers 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:32.610
 you can take to add the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:33.750
 drawings sketches and sheath low more 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.820
 clear 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.570
 I also stopped a click on the top bar 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.500
 to draw here in the most you can 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.500
 create new calls 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.190
 now regulates the size of the 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.530
 brush is that if you do not pay the bills 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.540
 different from the sky 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:00.440
 Let's see some of this team 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.440
 points to son 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.020
 this one has the rounded tips 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.250
 this one is a little thicker this 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.660
 that has a more child finish and the 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.880
 very thin tips and tips 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.729
 rounded this also here with her 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.729
 rounded tips and medium is thin 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.630
 I had to finish the work. 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.010
 use the brush that day as much son 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.010
 to see how it's going to stay 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:47.669
 make the traits at once having the 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:50.009
 traces a label that will set the 1-1 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.800
 In the case of the ipad there is no 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.199
 pen for you to leave no trace to 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.259
 its culture is to have a city ​​pass 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:02.389
 slowly drastically some if you pass 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:04.530
 back fastens firmly 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.750
 so come on 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.650
 here I going to compete in the dash 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.550
 get firmer 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.789
 Look, vote. She does not like the trait. 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:19.830
 this close together the tips closed 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:21.199
 between the objects in the base drawing 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.330
 after the street 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.819
 well now I want you to do this 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.250
 finish can use a good idea or in 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.349
 one does and you have in that environment 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.819
 similar in the tools being treated 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:38.430
 pass on to me at least four examples 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.050
 if you do more, it's even better, but 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.180
 it may be gifts that you have already made 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.340
 sketch you like to do the 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.740
 parliament make a moment inclusive 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.870
 complete is cool for now is this 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.870
 waiting until the next exercise
