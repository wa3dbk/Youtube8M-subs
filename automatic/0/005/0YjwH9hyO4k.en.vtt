00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:14.219
 here we are in the subway out of meters and go 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.699
 on the station on as you can see headless 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.320
 some kind of unusual metro state 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.000
 can be about the attitude of their people to judge 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.490
 here 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.130
 the state of how people are brought 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.240
 it is very interesting to viewers 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.240
 platform completely closes 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.950
 between themselves and does not close 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.590
 we rise to the station interest what have 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.740
 them station 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740
 I 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.140
 on me 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 stayed by which we will go 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.290
 obviously everything is created for the transfer of large 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.250
 masses of people 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.280
 population concentration in hong kong 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.330
 high remind you that the territory will 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.770
 a small home three tourists still 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.340
 about seven and a half million 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.290
 people on private cars drive a little 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.290
 either very rich or taxi drivers 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.390
 tagliavini here 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.390
 spend life then skyscrapers we only 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.610
 that the garden metro passed literally under 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.610
 brass water or 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.030
 three hundred meters is very convenient to use 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.010
 even 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
 it is somehow strange that for the first time a ball 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.520
 they connect easily 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.229
 are bred intersect with transport 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.619
 knots 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.619
 bus trains ferries airport 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.690
 new from there 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.629
 here you can go to his report 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.629
 actually here here 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.090
 There is a number of mouth 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.180
 I don't know. I haven't been to Kiev for a long time. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.209
 metro and honestly try not to be 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 once changed karakatv he forgot 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.659
 interesting she also you play a little 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.659
 better 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:07.960
 the cleanliness is incredible here 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.960
 good smell and site action no more 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.700
 but the most important thing is that substances 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.170
 we go further but such things 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.640
 very quickly you start the effect 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.400
 Stalin 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.130
 In general, the essence of the meter understood the huge 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.010
 transitions 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.300
 accelerated by these ribbons and the subway as 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.690
 usually like ours only 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.000
 extremely clean because the less 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.510
 taxes than purer meters such 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.470
 naturally the more taxes those in 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.940
 pipe summary 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.910
 and if from the very perimeter of the tax no 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:15.890
 everyone drives private cars fly to 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:18.580
 I want my own helicopters 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.580
 you are 510
