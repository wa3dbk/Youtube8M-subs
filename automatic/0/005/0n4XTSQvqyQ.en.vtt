00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.799
 commenting and I bring you today a tutorial 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.349
 of new minecraft to make a portal 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.000
 the lower world has no trick or anything 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.400
 like that is the version of 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.810
 minecraft playstation 3 well what 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.320
 first thing we have to do is place 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.010
 four rows in a row four of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.630
 rusted 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.210
 shortly after then look now that I have 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 the flying mode 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.960
 2 3 3 4 and 5 you have to do 5 height 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.899
 today shit 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.180
 but next to order then you join 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.180
 you make a portal to the lower world 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.230
 ok we have our portal to 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 lower world now what you have to 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.490
 to do is get a flint 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.620
 based on this I will not look for it 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.620
 is not among the tools in the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.330
 creative way you take the flint and you 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.030
 sets fire to any part of the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.920
 obsidian 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 and you see that it's going to come out in a kind of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 purple smoke 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.369
 then the only thing you have to do 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.240
 to enter very inferior is to jump and already 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.649
 you see how the world is transported behind 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.149
 and the world is already reached and entered 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.149
 lower and can be seen on screen 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.320
 Well now a lower world is going to come out 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.690
 there is a lot of enemy and things 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.360
 according to the world that you have to appear 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.820
 'aces' in one place or another referring 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.450
 style and depending on where you do the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.369
 portal will be in one place or in another those 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.320
 enemies there because that can give us 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.720
 stands for potions this world is very 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.660
 useful because they have blocks such as 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.000
 this non-mineral minerals are not 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.970
 earth names of the lower world are 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 You can get quartz and materials 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.479
 subtle as it can be nuggets of the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.810
 pigs are there ours and you can see 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:08.080
 and these enemies that you have in front of 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.360
 the stands for good potions and this 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.390
