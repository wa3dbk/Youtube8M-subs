00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 well found maybe they didn't tell you 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.840
 the truth 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.630
 indeed there is interest on the part of some 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.810
 gentlemen to make you believe exactly the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 contrary to what is really also 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.340
 the most famous case of abductions 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 so-called aliens that of travis 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 walton is very different from how it comes 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.080
 reported on many websites and in the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.739
 movie glows in the dark in the version 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.720
 he would be kidnapped see 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
 corpses of alien human beings 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.830
 monstrous and cannibal from which it escapes by 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 miracle 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.000
 and all the official version of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.440
 Travis reports instead of him 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 putting himself under the light beam of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.510
 flying saucer had been injured 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.760
 the aliens had brought him on board and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.619
 cured him not having understood that it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.379
 they were helping, he had also attacked 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.869
 a crew member ignoring 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.850
 being a droid when wandering 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.340
 finally reached the spaceship in the spaceship 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.649
 the presence of the real occupants remained 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.770
 surprised to find that they were men 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.859
 and women in slender blue overalls 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.560
 beautiful aspect they showed him the 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.869
 earth and without hurting him 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.740
 although he had attacked him 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.600
 left healed is free but this is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.890
 just the tip of the iceberg 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.249
 25 February 1942 whose sum 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 numerological and 7 an immense spaceship 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.659
 surrounded by smaller aircraft 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.390
 I fly over the Los Angeles area 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.280
 the US military tried in vain to 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.630
 tear it down with thousands of bullets 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.270
 fired from heavy artillery 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.939
 but the blows accounted for a sort of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.860
 visible defensive screen instead of 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.020
 respond to fire by taking revenge 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.840
 of the unjust attack he immediately aimed at 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.960
 clearly to kill the abbattendoli 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.610
 members of the mysterious crew 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.099
 they continued their journey by disappearing 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 exactly how they had appeared in 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.319
 directions of the pacific ocean 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.690
 in truth there are chronicles from na li that 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.670
 report evidence of airships 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.160
 on the area of ​​the current los angeles 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.310
 in times when planes were not 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.440
 the reason was not even invented yet 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.230
 for which these sightings took place 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.760
 focus on california resides 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.220
 in the sea depths 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.500
 if in fact you observe satellite photos 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.160
 able to portray the backdrops that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.070
 they line this area 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.540
 you will notice long tunnels with the width of 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.820
 one km and 500 meters whose length 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.710
 constancy and deviations are such as to make 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.220
 think about being structures 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.340
 artificial that is built from forms of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.690
 intelligent life and not a consequence of 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.660
 natural phenomena 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.720
 always coincidentally buildings 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.720
 similar are also present on mars 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.700
 but that's not all they recently have been 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.610
 identified some discoid objects 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.860
 large as a football field laid down 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.890
 on the seabed in front of the area of ​​the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.170
 historical sightings what matters not 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.870
 it is to admit or not the existence of the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.300
 aliens but understand that if they were 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.790
 actually present on this planet from 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.740
 ancient times as one could of the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.570
 rest already guess by reading so 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.220
 corrected the sacred texts of any 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.010
 earthly religion 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.200
 certainly they have no hostile intentions 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.510
 because if it had wanted to annihilate 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.550
 humanity would have been enough to make it fall 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.670
 on the oceans, objects whose speed 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.370
 impact free enough energy a 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.150
 produce waves about a thousand high 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.860
 meters whose speed in a few seconds 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.260
 would kill at least 3 billion of the 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.230
 population living along the coasts 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.180
 the remaining 4 billion could be 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.900
 slain by unhooking the same objects 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.730
 on the mainland in fact 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.730
 the pact would devastate the remaining part 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.430
 of human civilization to generate explosions 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.049
 similar to nuclear weapons but without the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.480
 radioactive fallout 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.879
 so the planet would still live 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.949
 the few survivors would come 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.810
 exterminated using viruses and 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.289
 specially made nanomachines 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.509
 to break up human DNA by not using 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.300
 nuclear weapons and striking suddenly 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.330
 the human race would be extinct today and the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.220
 planet I repeat, however, habitable 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.289
 no form of defense even today 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.330
 it would be possible because a 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.850
 electromagnetic pulse to destroy 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.010
 any human equipment capable 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.460
 to launch missiles can communicate 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.850
 internet computer car light aircraft e 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.979
 whatever else would disappear in a moment if 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.560
 aliens exist and are present 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.020
 so be assured that you never are 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.930
 had no intention of making you 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.990
 bad 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.000
 if anything 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.610
 that of helping the son-in-law ad 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.620
 evolve before to foolishness of 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.240
 some of them carry them 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.130
 self-destruction 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.650
 also take what I told you at the same time 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.170
 a fairy tale but reflect on the moral 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.450
 so that if one day the presence 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.090
 alien proves not only real but 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.390
 historical one will know how to accept it in a way 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.800
 mature allowing the human race of 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.620
 abandon the current phase 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.310
 adolescent to finally become 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.510
 a mature and responsible civilization that a 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.580
 good start 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.380
 it would prove to really have 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.580
 understood what I mean by the phrase for years 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.360
 improving ourselves 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.930
 let's improve our world a hug 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.930
 a dama
