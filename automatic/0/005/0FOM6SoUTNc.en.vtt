00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello kundi spa I disturb you ready mister 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.810
 no mica are in the last game you have not 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 given the best of you I can ask you 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.859
 how come I didn't give the best of me but 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 if the team sucks but what why 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.369
 he only takes it out on me but look at him 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 others what they do in the field than not 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.789
 they know how to make a happy fuck 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 if we are fifth in the ranking a reason 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.989
 we will therefore now be engaged that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.969
 we need your goals see you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.440
 today at the training camp if you are 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.180
 those in home classes know what it is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 the reason why you surely have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 paid a few games because it is 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.600
 inadmissible that you are here you are 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.539
 then classify and don't know how to do a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.690
 pass a long throw nothing nothing 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.059
 nothing a blessed fucking diversity 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.860
 unwatchable and I don't want things 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.550
 demonstrate with words but with deeds 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.859
 ok okay cir a training camp 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.719
 hello you have a nice character with a spa 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.920
 Now show me what you know on the field 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.040
 do 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 I have a nice temper but thanks first 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 attacks me at the beginning with a beautiful 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.509
 we will decide anyway there 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 let's see you now do not worry 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.960
 that much I am done something I do not 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.960
 let's do a fucking ad hoc 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 hello with spa i'm your attorney 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.810
 we had a problem i need to talk to you 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.750
 urgently by luca tell me everything I am 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.710
 here they waited so he called for 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.450
 a serious problem 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.610
 we have to start all over again 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 because your new company fails to 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 pay your salary and declared 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.119
 failure but excuse that it is not possible 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.299
 we just arrived there was nothing else 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.899
 so I do what I do 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.850
 you say but I seem to give you some 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.619
 day to decide what to do mine 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.479
 advice is to return to Palermo and 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.200
 to borrow in another company 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.689
 so you can grow 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.640
 to me, however, I'm sorry because 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.360
 we had problems in the first ones 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.940
 but I wanted to continue with it 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 I listen to you if you prefer that I will listen 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.760
 also of course my fans 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.040
 if you prefer, return to Palermo 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.349
 starting over at Palermo and then maybe 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.290
 back imprinted in your company 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.700
 let's start again like the career 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.709
 at first I'm really sorry for 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 how the adventure with the juve ended 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.049
 stabia 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.750
 we hope the new adventure is more 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.549
 fortunate body ore iss therefore also 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 I really hope that the new one 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.269
 adventure is both luckier than 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 this because I wanted and know anyway 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.319
 also that all my fakes kept there 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.480
 we hear in the coming days bye with 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.519
 dis then I recommend strength and courage is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.980
 it was just a road accident 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.260
 hello luca from the cc from the next days six 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.019
 I am quiet too, I am quiet 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.489
 anyway because i think it was 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.819
 really just the route incident 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.010
 and I'm sure it will be better than 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.110
 in the next new carrea then rai 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.459
 we feel we have decided what to do and then we will 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.459
 let's know maybe I'll call you 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.730
 then I hope that two short intro two 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.080
 what you love you liked I tried 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.390
 explain it to you a little more 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.100
 funny what had happened even though 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.840
 who was already a fan of my page 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.990
 facebook you always find this 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.850
 description is already the same 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.260
 this morning practically while I was going to 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.820
 start street after doing 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.620
 the intro the first i got this 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.780
 problem you're looking at anyway 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.280
 below, I think I had a problem 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.020
 nel ne saves in the bailouts that is second 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.890
 it was my mistake of 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.710
 carelessness or it was a bug in the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.240
 the fact is that how you are seeing 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.420
 however containing see up to 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.520
 end of the video and all the saves that 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.070
 I had that they were all those from 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.800
 video career that the bailouts bear 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.390
 to the player they are whores because they are 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.690
 left only that video career and 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.160
 I say less bad because it still burned me 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.680
 more if the video career a 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.100
 unsubscribe because it's mine anyway 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.970
 career are already twenty-first thesis 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.430
 episode is already after 21 bonds 21 episodes 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.930
 it will be a little more work and that only eight 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.170
 episodes of a player's career 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.800
 so it went well but you have them 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.660
 I got it 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.460
 in the sense that to say why in any case to me 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.190
 I would make the player hull a series 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.020
 which I like because schools anyway 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.680
 however secondary however however or 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.490
 however it is a fun second series 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.890
 me however an alternative to rpg is the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.170
 career in video career then one 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.460
 carrÃ¨ which is fun anyway and me 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.610
 like it 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.100
 and then I want to start it again because if 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.050
 I had this problem because of me or 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.480
 by chance of the game I still don't know 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.090
 problems also that it was mine 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.250
 I'm wrong, I wonder if I saved 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.860
 there the videos are saved his career 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.640
 player on a video file 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.640
 tough career I shouldn't have all the 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.560
 player carts instead of all 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.979
 video career and this that I can not 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.110
 to understand 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.310
 probable also that I saved the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.380
 file of 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.150
 has now played the video cart 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.850
 Player file career not 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.260
 so there was this case of problems but 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.870
 I hope you recapitulate it the more I will be 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.250
 I attentively is the second time we 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.040
 it happens even if the first one had been 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.230
 own files popped in damaged files 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.090
 that of wolverhampton last year 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.220
 but the first time that happens with fo 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.720
 14 I'm sorry for those who had thought of 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.320
 long educate us is not true because me 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.220
 like according to you using a job 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.010
 because there is work behind it anyway 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.560
 each video sputtano now now and then I 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.170
 eight episodes and behind this series 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.010
 taking advantage of the hours of work to do 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.510
 things to start there was a dick 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.320
 of problem you understood you have it 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.350
 seen 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.580
 I think it should be fine now 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.500
 because a little speeded up everything 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.290
 otherwise st 20 minutes to make her 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.900
 these four things 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.670
 however now all I hope for 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.440
 you start again with palermo both 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.540
 a great idea because anyway it is read 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.070
 a project we started let's finish it 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.140
 however it is an alternative location 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.470
 I really like the object with select 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.630
 I very much hope you are intro there 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.490
 liked it before the video ends 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.470
 I want to thank my fans that 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.820
 they helped me this morning as well 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.500
 tried to help me 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.430
 a second that they tell me then 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:44.000
 I thank Leonardo and I thank the usual 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.190

 who gave one hundred percent for 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.780
 try to give me a hand 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:55.010
 however it does the same we take it back 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.620
 immediately maybe I'll do not call it 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.150
 tenth or first video anyway 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.640
 we will start again with the father not 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.790
 I hope your idea is the parma king 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.890
 seated please do not pray that you are sitting 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.470
