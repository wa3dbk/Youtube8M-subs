00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.100
 Here we have a small digital water sticking out 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.649
 from the emperor 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:13.649
 This is characterized by a special feature that is not just this 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.150
 because ever the ad has the front of the costume also a view Winnenden 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.919
 go 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.229
 Head and a comrade BZ what can also be recognized on the search market 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.710
 but this spirit level of 2 2 was also beyond one 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.259
 Fence on which of course you can turn off the first endurance test 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.500
 whole looks in practice then like this 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.130
 as soon as 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.749
 it is straight ahead 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.070
 Today, federal and state governments want 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 it's done a signal 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.570
 the special 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.730
 and this water percent digital spirit level is that one so here 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.370
 Really every single point is one can set the PIN can that catch 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 So I want the sensitivity 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.990
 Can adjust the water I can set the big strength of the signal 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.110
 I can even turn off danger 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.960
 and that personally 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.600
 very very class I found not only an orientation in the hand 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 Percent horizontal but I can do this, of course, too 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.720
 Wertheim 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.870
 adjust and let display 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.620
 Of course, there is another set of possibilities in the area of 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.890
 Panoramic photography the calibration and adjustment of each 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.880
 Highlights 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 always happens and me that 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 + and - Carsten that's all really and yet wonderfully antesten 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.210
 Fantastically written when we need it now is beyond dispute 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.100
 for example, that puts up eternity in many places 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990
 Vienna Online is made 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.950
 Here are very big football look two pictures if points written on 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.230
 So that's what I wanted to understand 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.660
 and percent here's a metal plate on it announced 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.780
 Alban guilty plastic plate are located on this plastic plate 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.320
 here 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.180
 you can just that means you can also a patch surface drops 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.670
 first of all, for example 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.600
 to properly align a tripod before shooting 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 So if Dr 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.129
 Instead of the clutch being screwed on it is usually due to its one 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.619
 metal plate 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.959
 even the spirit level Fürth is very simple 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.939
 This contact we just with the 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.849
 Deferred British Open 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.189
 turned 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.140
 and then you can do it on the tripod 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.389
 wonderful 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.479
 the spirit level to align that chamber 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.779
 and that makes him applause are in the field of panoramic photography and 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.299
 really should be Déruns and Mercier room rate that also saves like 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.639
 Photoshop edited 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.799
 I do not do that at all 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.669
 So this spirit level is actually that must show that baffles me 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.819
 again and again whether to align the Titan 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:47.880
 fantastic 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.690
 the moment I am here with the eye and the face of a comrade 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.690
 through the viewfinder, I look from the perspective 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.999
 that solved the problem additional game so great damage 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.159
 on 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.469
 excellent you can write off so much 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.289
 who does not like that, however, I find it very useful and 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.949
 so I also have a double confirmation of the 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:11.929
 an optical 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.929
 Signal and now also an acoustic CIGNA 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.659
 there you can stop them 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.659
 but the vertical 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.949
 if it has told you also the sensitivity 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.879
 From which degree me a signal should be displayed here or 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.329
 for you cold of inclination 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.739
 when the CD water consumption responds 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.370
 that can also stop now as I said up here it will be scarce 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.229
 Guys the battery compartment 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.239
 that is one too 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.639
 there are two of these waters and 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.759
 Secondly, how are batteries and you still supplied the packaging 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:55.349
 the water is looking for a half photographer at least 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.169
 and then this water was also easy to turn on 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.889
 after 20 minutes 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.699
 if he really comes power 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.779
 Percent but also who that is too much also this function can be 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.930
 Disable because it looks so small and the systems also so useful 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:08.689
 is too is 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.279
 So it really stands out about setting options 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:14.279
 which I can not imagine all individually now as I said 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.469
 There are several points in Emanuel 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:21.769
 Zeroing points I can create the infection for example 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.860
 can adjust the sensitivity the acoustic signal is a bit far 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.229
 I can still reset everything if I want 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.770
 the automatic 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.770
 the shutdown I can activate and and and 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.120
 because what I should always have with me then I do not know one 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.360
 of course, now 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080
 somehow a week was through the botany buy but I guess there 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.409
 I want that almost certainly the much more elegant solution
