00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
to look for pocket flaps on the hip

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.360 
to look for pocket flaps on the hip
again<00:02:34.870> it's<00:02:35.049> going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> help<00:02:35.349> emphasize<00:02:35.620> your

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
again it's going to help emphasize your

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.539 
again it's going to help emphasize your
narrower<00:02:36.730> waist<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.519> a

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
narrower waist and this one here is a

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.280 
narrower waist and this one here is a
tricky<00:02:39.940> one<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.120> people<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.629> are<00:02:40.780> hourglass

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
tricky one for people that are hourglass

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.990 
tricky one for people that are hourglass
body<00:02:41.500> shapes<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.430> reason<00:02:42.760> why<00:02:42.940> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
body shapes and the reason why is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.610 
body shapes and the reason why is
because<00:02:43.209> if<00:02:43.569> you're<00:02:43.750> an<00:02:43.840> hourglass<00:02:44.349> body

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
because if you're an hourglass body

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.770 
because if you're an hourglass body
shape<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.099> usually<00:02:45.310> difficult<00:02:45.879> for<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.510> to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
shape it's usually difficult for you to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.930 
shape it's usually difficult for you to
find<00:02:47.019> pants<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.129> wear<00:02:48.250> pants<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.910> fit

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
find pants and wear pants that fit

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.759 
find pants and wear pants that fit
properly<00:02:49.420> because<00:02:50.079> there's<00:02:50.379> such<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> big

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
properly because there's such a big

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.710 
properly because there's such a big
difference<00:02:50.950> between<00:02:51.250> your<00:02:51.700> hips<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.239> your

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
difference between your hips and your

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.990 
difference between your hips and your
waist<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.470> usually<00:02:53.980> they'll<00:02:54.190> be<00:02:54.400> tight<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
waist so usually they'll be tight and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.849 
waist so usually they'll be tight and
fitted<00:02:55.209> around<00:02:55.420> your<00:02:55.930> thigh<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.260> your<00:02:56.650> hip

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
fitted around your thigh and your hip

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.190 
fitted around your thigh and your hip
area<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.459> they'll<00:02:58.120> be<00:02:58.299> loose<00:02:58.750> around<00:02:59.079> your

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
area and they'll be loose around your

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.780 
area and they'll be loose around your
waist<00:02:59.409> so<00:02:59.590> it's<00:02:59.739> all<00:02:59.920> fit<00:03:00.159> in<00:03:00.310> where<00:03:00.609> it's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
waist so it's all fit in where it's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.280 
waist so it's all fit in where it's
loose<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.720> wear<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> belt<00:03:02.049> and

loose and you have to wear a belt and
bunches<00:03:02.859> and<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.069> doesn't<00:03:03.400> look<00:03:03.549> too

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
bunches and it doesn't look too

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.630 
bunches and it doesn't look too
attractive<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:05.170> generally<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:05.859> you<00:03:06.040> are<00:03:06.069> an
