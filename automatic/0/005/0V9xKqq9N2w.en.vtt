00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.210
 to a new video as he already knows 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.400
 have the colors of directions 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.990
 partly changed I have it too 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.120
 already in the last one the new one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.380
 said directions video but I have to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.480
 of course, here more explained 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 for the people the first video about it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.260
 So I did not see it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480
 about a year ago a video 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.609
 made to all colors by directions 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 I showed you how they look 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.230
 colors like wash themselves out and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.970
 if nothing was known the education 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 here was yes or no and stop it 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 So naturally have what exactly what I to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.090
 could say color and I will you 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.670
 So in these the new directions 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.040
 videos show how the individual look 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.309
 color tinted, they can be on 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.620
 bleach how to wash out and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.360
 So keep natural hair just that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.520
 So it's almost just like 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.350
 update as always his photos of the fab 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.059
 flowed in the killed state after 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.800
 bleach while washing and so on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 on my blog the link to this is here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.039
 in the description and as you can 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.359
 look at you that again in peace if 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.520
 I now here in the videos too 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.530
 the actions are very fast 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.390
 I thought there were over 30 colors 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.830
 I did not want that all in one video 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.510
 but I will be in several 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.270
 to do parts here i said like i did 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.220
 recently turned off the first part and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.700
 this is the second part here 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 now the following colors of the mandarin 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.409
 apricot and tactile how often you do that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 Angelina is probably speaking 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.650
 I do not care if that says it here 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.229
 Do you see the colors after seeing them? 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.740
 freshly applied to the color-rove 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.170
 have and after the contact time and in the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.470
 dry state then see that way 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 Tinted out and Paris is one of those 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.920
 dark point and cherry pink that is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.710
 I think I still translate others 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.869
 is such a pink orange so I think 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.000
 even that orange easily in pink 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.729
 Stitch apricot is such a dell 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.850
 morally so big orange as well 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.570
 typical and refueling is such a red 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.250
 orange are three different ones 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.530
 orange tones but all a bit 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 look different and just this 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.340
 dark pink yes then I have just 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.890
 try this color on too blond here 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 at paris it is almost complete 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.820
 gone out slight redstitch is still 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.560
 but it could be the same 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.570
 good to be that kinda in 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.920
 The strand has washed so when 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.130
 wash out that there just such a small 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.480
 I was left red 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.680
 actually rather because it is on the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.680
 whole route looks like this 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.270
 same with mandarin and apricot 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.100
 pretty much completely removed 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.110
 And this rose stitch is still there 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.140
 but as I said probably from 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.739
 wash out and templin is 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.020
 almost nothing happens is very small 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.580
 bit brighter but the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.560
 Blocking actually makes the paint 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.550
 nothing and have the blondierung then 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 Of course, with one before 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.989
 washed out after a short game and 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.459
 about it and then the result 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.450
 that's why the colors are 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.739
 in itself a little bit lighter 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.610
 because now, of course, then 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.250
 even the quasi first 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.560
 Hair wash at the same time was and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 After the second hair wash has become 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.920
 Actually hardly anything changes the colors 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.260
 if then only very small 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.820
 bit brighter and after the third 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.610
 It is mandarin and hair wash 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.709
 apricot so they are very fast 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.989
 disappear I find the durability 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.470
 is not so good on foot I think 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.970
 a color that bled very heavily and 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.350
 therefore this strand stained from where 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.680
 she gets the whole strand her son 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.450
 orange pink stitch because the color is simple 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.040
 so much bleeding so I always call that 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 exhaust is a color when washing 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.620
 keep looking for her until you know what I am 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.570
 my 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.760
 but also important gradually 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.350
 always a bit far out after the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.079
 fourth which also not possible 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.120
 something happens after the fifth 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.430
 The laundry will cerise gradually 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.700
 brighter and tallinn will also be clear 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.310
 brighter after the sixth wash is going on 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.440
 then suddenly a great deal 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.450
 Paris has become much brighter 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.790
 if there's someone apricot pretty much 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.040
 completely outside already and thank you 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.049
 but talking is very good to recognize 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.269
 I also like the color a bit 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.610
 more persistent than the other colors after 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.090
 the seventh hair wash 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.340
 Anke rÃ¤hm is very bright but always 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.690
 still visible and after the eighth which 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.480
 you can see that very clearly that 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.100
 singer is much more persistent than 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.570
 So the other drive is important 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.090
 still there are the other colors 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.010
 not really to see but after 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.359
 and after washing this live table 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.240
 there is also a denser one now 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.570
 enduring but a bit the color 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.670
 It's really more persistent 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.920
 in total for you that paris and turin 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.660
 definitely the most persistent 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.330
 Let's get down to durability 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.400
 natural hair in Paris is so 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.560
 that the color is really very much 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.480
 Good on natural preserves is too 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.160
 really strong you can see them 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.360
 I 'm fine too 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.310
 Imagine having it at need 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.220
 It looks nice, of course 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.660
 then not strong but such a pink 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.470
 The load will always be lighter on everyone 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.690
 be there 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.310
 It really lasts a very long time 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.690
 I have here now after the first one 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.000
 second hair wash never really one 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.460
 difference only after the 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.290
 third hair wash you can see it here 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.180
 that the color is now a little bit 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.470
 bit lighter after the fourth 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.660
 hair wash again a whole 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.070
 little bit lighter and first 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.950
 after the fifth hair wash is the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.360
 color then so reasonably outside 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.340
 I still stand there easier 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.410
 Keeps much better than you drive 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.720
 I had shown at the time 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.940
 It is so that the hair he is for 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.919
 light gold orange gets you something 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.270
 By the way, I think it's very nice 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.010
 not really bright orange 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.900
 does not look very colorful now 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.340
 in the sense but the hair sounds 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.169
 just so easy stitch is seen 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.090
 extremely natural from hair shine like that 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.880
 nice and the whole was after three 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.040
 then prevail outside at apricot 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.020
 it is very similar that is not gold 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.870
 orange tone but just one 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.250
 gold trust me ministers at my place 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.229
 the beautiful years shining through 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.689
 extreme, if we have two now 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.860
 kept hair wash 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.809
 but I also find the result 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.129
 eerily beautiful very natural you look 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:57.080
 not that it's actually a colorful one 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.629
 it's actually color rather than color 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.309
 but gold are really beautiful 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.809
 when days rain I find that 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:05.209
 honestly not so nice 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:07.519
 it looks kind of weird 

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:10.069
 orange was off after the second 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:11.119
 hair wash then yellow and then was 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.129
 Thank God, even after the third 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.329
 haarwÃ¤sche no longer I see my 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.099
 Tastes are different but me 

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:17.929
 the sound is now on my nature 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.149
 color did not like at all 

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:21.259
 on the artificial from what, of course 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:22.339
 It is always a matter of taste if that is 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.110
 it's nice 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.209
 that's the case with me now 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.699
 Did not like the three orange school 

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:31.339
 are also natural hair although visible but 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.269
 also not so durable after 23 years im 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.459
 then they are already cut again 

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:36.969
 It was definitely torn outside 

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:39.559
 recommend if you have undoped hair 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.029
 You should have bright hair as possible 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.919
 because the darker that means the less 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.389
 of course you see it as I said 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.289
 if one has rather brown hair now 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.869
 then you probably only 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.319
 immediately recognize the pink stitch and 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:53.479
 cherry pink stitch or purple ever stands 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.579
 after how does that change the hair color 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.929
 Adding whatever looks nice can 

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:58.519
 you would have to try it out only at 

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:59.749
 very dark has always been difficult though 

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.939
 then probably nothing more 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.529
 but wants to see now on mittelblond 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:05.360
 light brown hair I believe we can 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.849
 You have to look pretty nice 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.619
 Try it out anyway 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.869
 for those who wanted to know because
