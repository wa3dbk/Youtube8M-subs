00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
on the green screen this is probably the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.760 
on the green screen this is probably the
most<00:01:05.830> important<00:01:06.460> don't<00:01:07.390> wear<00:01:07.570> green<00:01:07.990> when<00:01:08.680> you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
you'll just become invisible the next

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.670 
you'll just become invisible the next
step<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.479> get<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.840> background<00:01:14.229> image<00:01:14.440> we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
step is to get the background image we

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.950 
step is to get the background image we
call<00:01:14.860> this<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.040> background<00:01:15.520> jump<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.810> this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
call this a background jump and this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.090 
call this a background jump and this
stays<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.410> picture<00:01:17.680> in<00:01:17.740> New<00:01:17.830> York<00:01:18.040> City
