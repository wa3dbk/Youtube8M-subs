the focus in my work and I felt there
was<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> need<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> guide<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.230> artist

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
was a need for a guide that an artist

selection and mixing of color I set a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.670 
selection and mixing of color I set a
goal<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.750> once<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.320> all

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
take the guesswork out of mixing color

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
take the guesswork out of mixing color
to<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> simple<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.789> why<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> created

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to make it simple that's why I created

there<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.230> many<00:00:58.590> books<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.129> deal<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
there are many books that deal with the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.849 
there are many books that deal with the
issue<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.910> color<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> library<00:01:01.620> full

how the magic palette works it works on

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.090 
how the magic palette works it works on
a<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.490> simple<00:01:17.880> grid<00:01:18.270> system<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:19.020> artist<00:01:19.890> can

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
a very simple grid system an artist can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.960 
a very simple grid system an artist can
select<00:01:20.490> any<00:01:20.729> color<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> guide<00:01:22.790> from<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
select any color from the guide from the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.620 
select any color from the guide from the
selected<00:01:24.479> color<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.740> follow<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.400> row<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
selected color you follow the row to the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
selected color you follow the row to the
left<00:01:27.900> margin<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.250> find<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
left margin where you will find the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
left margin where you will find the
dominant<00:01:30.240> color<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.320> case<00:01:31.619> it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
dominant color in this case it's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.480 
dominant color in this case it's
cerulean<00:01:32.579> blue<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> selected

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
cerulean blue then from the selected

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.630 
cerulean blue then from the selected
color<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.390> follow<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.930> column<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
color you follow the column down to the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.460 
color you follow the column down to the
bottom<00:01:38.970> margin<00:01:39.450> where<00:01:39.840> you'll<00:01:40.079> find<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
bottom margin where you'll find the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.080 
bottom margin where you'll find the
mixing<00:01:40.920> color<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:42.030> case<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.960> SAP<00:01:43.320> green

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
mixing color in this case it's SAP green

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.960 
mixing color in this case it's SAP green
so<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> color<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.259> mixture<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.950> those<00:01:47.640> two

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
so this color is a mixture of those two

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.179 
so this color is a mixture of those two
colors<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.049> place<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> dab<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
colors now you place a dab of the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.399 
colors now you place a dab of the
dominant<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.030> mixing<00:01:51.360> color<00:01:51.659> separately

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
dominant and the mixing color separately

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
dominant and the mixing color separately
on<00:01:52.619> your<00:01:52.799> palette<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.479> add<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.780> white<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
on your palette I add a little white to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
on your palette I add a little white to
the<00:01:55.409> colors<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.159> them<00:01:56.369> opaque<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the colors to make them opaque and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.120 
the colors to make them opaque and
easier<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.930> since<00:01:58.380> many<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> tube

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
easier to see since many of the tube

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.810 
easier to see since many of the tube
colors<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.790> dark<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> transparent<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.820> both

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
