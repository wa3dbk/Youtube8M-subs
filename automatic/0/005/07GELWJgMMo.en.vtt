00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
so when they recorded the buttons will

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.099 
so when they recorded the buttons will
light<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.859> I've<00:00:28.859> recorded<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.539> kick<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.750> hi-hat

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and a clap so what we can then do is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.310 
and a clap so what we can then do is
when<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> track<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.660> playing<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.140> just

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
bring this cue point back in so just to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.540 
bring this cue point back in so just to
prove<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.270> we're<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.660> collection

that'll<00:03:04.030> create<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.300> library<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.810> our<00:03:04.930> device

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
that'll create a library for our device

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.590 
that'll create a library for our device
and<00:03:05.730> there's<00:03:06.730> more<00:03:06.880> information<00:03:07.000> about

as<00:03:19.570> well<00:03:19.800> we<00:03:20.800> can<00:03:20.920> then<00:03:21.010> load<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.310> track<00:03:21.580> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
as well we can then load the track and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.210 
as well we can then load the track and
then<00:03:23.650> when<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:24.340> would<00:03:24.430> call<00:03:24.610> those<00:03:24.730> cue<00:03:24.970> points

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
then when we would call those cue points

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.600 
then when we would call those cue points
they're<00:03:27.220> all<00:03:27.340> going<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.519> be<00:03:27.610> reset<00:03:29.430> from<00:03:30.430> where

they're all going to be reset from where

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.100 
they're all going to be reset from where
they've<00:03:30.700> been<00:03:30.730> set<00:03:31.060> within<00:03:31.330> record<00:03:31.690> box<00:03:32.970> so

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
they've been set within record box so

simple as that you can create them on

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.770 
simple as that you can create them on
the<00:03:36.550> r1<00:03:36.850> or<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.150> can<00:03:37.239> create<00:03:37.420> them<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.600> metal

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
