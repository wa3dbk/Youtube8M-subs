not gonna be able to kill Marines in one
shot<00:00:39.420> which<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.680> thing<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> he<00:00:41.129> really

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
shot which is the thing that he really

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.180 
shot which is the thing that he really
needs<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.260> mean<00:00:43.260> he<00:00:43.350> may<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.620> able<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> kill<00:00:44.040> them

needs I mean he may be able to kill them
in<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.430> shot<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.180> really

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
in one shot but it's going to be really

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
in one shot but it's going to be really
risky<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.930> his<00:00:46.020> muniz<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.950> six

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
risky for his muniz we see that six

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
risky for his muniz we see that six
meters<00:00:47.579> are<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.899> rain<00:00:49.110> goes

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
single one if he wants to win this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.130 
single one if he wants to win this
because<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.810> how<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
because right now at the how this is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
because right now at the how this is
looking<00:01:52.280> he<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> lose<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.000> game

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
looking he is going to lose this game

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.170 
looking he is going to lose this game
and<00:01:54.979> he<00:01:55.979> needs<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> micro<00:01:56.579> those<00:01:56.729> minerals<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and he needs to micro those minerals as

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
and he needs to micro those minerals as
well<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.930> possible<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> there's<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
well as possible we see that there's a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
well as possible we see that there's a
pretty<00:01:59.399> large<00:01:59.579> amount<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> mystics<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.630> now

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
pretty large amount of mystics right now

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
pretty large amount of mystics right now
so<00:02:01.350> i<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.890> Savior<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:03.060> micra<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so i think that Savior can micra this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.789 
so i think that Savior can micra this
off<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.840> believe<00:02:04.079> he<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.439> make<00:02:04.590> her<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
off I do believe he can make her this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.560 
off I do believe he can make her this
off<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> hatchery<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.119> about<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> die

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
off but that hatchery is about to die

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.029 
off but that hatchery is about to die
there's<00:02:06.810> no<00:02:06.960> drones<00:02:07.259> mining<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
there's no drones mining at that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.040 
there's no drones mining at that
expansion

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
expansion

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.200 
expansion
and<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.560> not<00:02:10.160> good<00:02:10.520> if<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.880> hatchery

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
and this is not good if that hatchery

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.390 
and this is not good if that hatchery
goes<00:02:11.360> down<00:02:11.600> he<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.410> going<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.860> lose<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.160> game

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
goes down he is going to lose this game

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.190 
goes down he is going to lose this game
if<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.790> hatchery<00:02:14.120> goes<00:02:14.270> down<00:02:14.480> because<00:02:14.810> he's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
if that hatchery goes down because he's

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.540 
if that hatchery goes down because he's
not<00:02:15.380> going<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.560> get<00:02:15.740> have<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.070> economy<00:02:16.430> and

hatchery does go down and that's very

something<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.169> come<00:04:24.319> up<00:04:24.469> but<00:04:25.509> it<00:04:26.509> seems<00:04:26.840> that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
something to come up but it seems that

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.200 
something to come up but it seems that
both<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.800> forces<00:04:28.189> are<00:04:28.310> completely<00:04:28.789> decimated

at<00:04:29.389> now<00:04:29.539> at<00:04:29.749> this<00:04:29.870> point<00:04:30.139> which<00:04:30.740> means<00:04:31.039> that

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
at now at this point which means that

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.269 
at now at this point which means that

only<00:04:52.430> 10<00:04:52.729> he's<00:04:53.479> only<00:04:53.659> going<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.169> be<00:04:54.259> able<00:04:54.500> to

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
only 10 he's only going to be able to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.279 
only 10 he's only going to be able to
produce<00:04:54.979> three<00:04:55.639> at<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.759> time<00:04:55.849> which<00:04:56.659> I<00:04:56.779> doubt<00:04:56.930> he

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
produce three at a time which I doubt he

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.830 
produce three at a time which I doubt he
even<00:04:57.500> has<00:04:57.860> resources<00:04:58.219> for<00:04:58.610> that<00:04:58.729> so<00:04:59.270> Savior<00:04:59.659> is

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
even has resources for that so Savior is

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.050 
even has resources for that so Savior is

think he's pretty good as well and I

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.529 
think he's pretty good as well and I
think<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:34.129> if<00:05:34.339> Savior<00:05:34.849> did<00:05:35.089> go<00:05:35.240> for<00:05:35.419> that

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
think that if Savior did go for that

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.050 
think that if Savior did go for that
three<00:05:35.870> hatch<00:05:36.080> rebuild<00:05:36.529> which<00:05:37.129> would<00:05:37.339> have<00:05:37.460> had

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
three hatch rebuild which would have had

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.329 
three hatch rebuild which would have had
his<00:05:38.300> economy<00:05:38.930> and<00:05:39.169> macro<00:05:39.589> much<00:05:39.860> more<00:05:40.069> stable

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:40.339 
his economy and macro much more stable

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.809 
his economy and macro much more stable
and<00:05:40.810> then<00:05:41.810> went<00:05:42.379> for<00:05:42.589> the<00:05:42.680> mule<00:05:42.919> escs<00:05:43.310> he<00:05:43.669> would

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
and then went for the mule escs he would

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.670 
and then went for the mule escs he would
have<00:05:43.909> had<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.089> much<00:05:44.210> better<00:05:44.629> chance<00:05:44.930> because

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
have had a much better chance because

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.129 
have had a much better chance because
flash<00:05:46.099> saw<00:05:46.490> that<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:47.060> he<00:05:47.120> took<00:05:47.479> advantage<00:05:47.629> of

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
flash saw that and he took advantage of

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:54.430 
flash saw that and he took advantage of
it<00:05:48.319> and<00:05:48.879> you've<00:05:49.879> just<00:05:49.960> decimated<00:05:50.960> savior<00:05:51.740> GG
