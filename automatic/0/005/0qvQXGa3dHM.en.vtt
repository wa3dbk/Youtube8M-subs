thing<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> carbon<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:09.390> doesn't<00:01:09.720> get

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
thing about the carbon is it doesn't get

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.710 
thing about the carbon is it doesn't get
as<00:01:09.960> hot<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.830> metals<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
as hot as the metals do so if you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 
as hot as the metals do so if you
somehow<00:01:13.049> accidentally<00:01:13.680> touched<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
somehow accidentally touched it with the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
somehow accidentally touched it with the
back<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.640> leg<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.180> pants<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:15.810> ankle

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
back your leg your pants your ankle

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
back your leg your pants your ankle
whatever<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> burn<00:01:18.060> your

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
whatever it's not going to burn your

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.999 
whatever it's not going to burn your
skin<00:01:18.570> off<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:20.000> metals<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:22.080> hot<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.920> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
skin off like metals do it's hot but it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
skin off like metals do it's hot but it
definitely<00:01:23.430> doesn't<00:01:23.610> burn<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.060> skin<00:01:24.270> like

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
definitely doesn't burn your skin like

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.020 
definitely doesn't burn your skin like
aluminum<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:25.560> stainless<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.100> titanium<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
aluminum or stainless or titanium so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
aluminum or stainless or titanium so
that's<00:01:27.360> definitely<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.750> extra<00:01:28.020> benefit<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that's definitely an extra benefit of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's definitely an extra benefit of
the<00:01:28.680> carbon

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the carbon

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.520 
the carbon
besides<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> lighter<00:01:31.320> weight

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
besides the look in the lighter weight

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.390 
besides the look in the lighter weight
and<00:01:32.240> we'll<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.450> ahead<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> show<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.950> how<00:01:35.040> easy

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
learned a long time ago was to take a

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.300 
learned a long time ago was to take a
little<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.370> little<00:02:49.940> bit<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.240> teflon<00:02:50.720> tape<00:02:50.900> and
