00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 hello to all guys here too 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.859
 agitation professional say how 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.620
 always care about our device 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.790
 first I will give you the link or sorry 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.089
 I was wrong 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.070
 ah sorry I don't have it ok, it's open there 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.920
 I will give the link to the page where you can 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 find this water rhythm when it is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.090
 arrived we will see you will do sites like 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 administrator will shut down ours 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.520
 device and we will already break the queue 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:41.390
 with next and then later it's up to do these 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:41.390
 things here and should play well 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:58.650
 wait instead for iphone 4 ipad 2 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.080
 or to 5.1.1 bacteria you can put 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:08.090
 directly without having to turn it off 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:13.650
 so we leave for the jailbreak 2 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 both at once 7 6 5 4 3 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.869
 2 1 only for 15 seconds 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.860
 or that normally shouldn't do it 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.860
 now here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.710
 so that we do them 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.280
 now instead it should do is indeed 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.030
 no 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.320
 we wait a little longer with four 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.320
 reborn 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.739
 meanwhile, if nothing happens to me 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:44.220
 here is fact acknowledged by us fans 4 and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:50.470
 is preparing the jailbreak 70 80 90 100 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:54.340
 100 100 100 a few kernel pails 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.170
 I suppose he would like that to mean that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.060
 the store already weaving something of the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.500
 gender 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:09.980

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.810
 yes only of ok no next 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.180
 obviously this is a jailbreak here 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.910
 untethered means that you can turn off 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.980
 and turn on when you discharge 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.720
 turn it back on without having to do it every time 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.150
 stay here to turn it back on with the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.540

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.430
 boh it seems to me that with this 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:05.120
 hunger unblocking nothing after the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:05.120
 slow and we wait for them 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.080
 what I tell you stop again 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.920
 well at this point closures are 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.560
 detached everything because now not 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.250
 there was more need here is back 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.030
 here enter the code I enter mine 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.700
 code unlocks unlock also the sim 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.340
 that I had blocked because you never know 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.800
 here's to you cydia now you can't see 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.800
 so good is an icon that is all white 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.360

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.460
 genre also with the screen and now type yes 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.680
 is set to open to open and open 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:53.180
 close open and close again 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:54.920
 watched but how does it open ie does it 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.850
 pretend to open up to reality not 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.770
 it opens quietly it's a very normal thing 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.260
 you have to give him some time and maybe 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.360
 turn it off put it in charge 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.030
 put your own back a little 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.250
 sure applications because of course 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.840
 the year you restore you must go a 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.200
 little more kept there all the games are 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.240
 giorgia quite a lot of games 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.460

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.240

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.759
 contacts when to dress and how much 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.620
 reset your device 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.729
 I recommend you take away your asm if not 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.479
