00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.780 
and also the founder of SpaceX he's done
a<00:00:04.259> ton<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.560> stuff<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:05.339> artificial

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
a ton of stuff with artificial

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.330 
a ton of stuff with artificial
intelligence<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.930> advanced<00:00:07.620> computers<00:00:08.160> and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
intelligence and advanced computers and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.240 
intelligence and advanced computers and
all<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.580> fancy<00:00:08.849> stuff<00:00:09.090> uh<00:00:09.809> he<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.559> warning<00:00:11.040> us

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
all that fancy stuff uh he is warning us

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.629 
all that fancy stuff uh he is warning us
about<00:00:12.230> well<00:00:13.230> let's<00:00:13.620> listen<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.130> him<00:00:14.250> directly

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
about well let's listen to him directly

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.790 
about well let's listen to him directly
I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.960> should<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.230> very<00:00:16.410> careful<00:00:16.770> about

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
I think we should be very careful about

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.210 
I think we should be very careful about
artificial<00:00:17.220> intelligence<00:00:17.660> if<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.810> would<00:00:18.990> guess

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
artificial intelligence if I would guess

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
artificial intelligence if I would guess
at<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:21.060> our<00:00:21.270> biggest<00:00:21.480> existential<00:00:21.840> threat

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
at what our biggest existential threat

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.310 
at what our biggest existential threat
is<00:00:23.420> it's<00:00:24.420> probably<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:28.019> need<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> be

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
is it's probably that so we need to be

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.450 
is it's probably that so we need to be
very<00:00:28.500> careful<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> artificial

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
very careful with the artificial

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
very careful with the artificial
intelligence<00:00:30.500> increasing<00:00:31.500> client<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> think

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
intelligence increasing client to think

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
intelligence increasing client to think
that<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.369> should<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:35.090> regulatory

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that there should be some regulatory

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020 
that there should be some regulatory
oversight<00:00:36.770> at<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.010> internet<00:00:38.460> bigger<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
oversight at the internet bigger the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.810 
oversight at the internet bigger the
national<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> international<00:00:40.379> level<00:00:40.730> just<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
national and international level just to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.299 
national and international level just to
make<00:00:42.000> sure<00:00:42.350> that<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.160> something

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
make sure that we don't do something

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.750 
make sure that we don't do something
very<00:00:44.700> foolish<00:00:45.200> I<00:00:46.200> mean<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.280> artificial

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
very foolish I mean with artificial

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.420 
very foolish I mean with artificial
intelligence<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.329> summoning<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.870> demon

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
intelligence we are summoning the demon

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.410 
intelligence we are summoning the demon
you<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:50.969> those<00:00:51.120> stories

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you know you know all those stories

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
you know you know all those stories
where<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> guy<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> pentagram<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
where is the guy with the pentagram and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.889 
where is the guy with the pentagram and
the<00:00:53.730> holy<00:00:53.879> water<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> he's<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.600> yeah<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the holy water and he's like yeah you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.590 
the holy water and he's like yeah you
sure<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.379> control<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> demon<00:00:56.420> then<00:00:57.420> work

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
sure you can control the demon then work

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.430 
sure you can control the demon then work
out<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.460> think<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.789> will<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.940> no<00:01:00.239> hell<00:01:00.510> 9,000

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
out I think there will be no hell 9,000

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.550 
out I think there will be no hell 9,000
going<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.949> Mars<00:01:03.470> Hal<00:01:04.470> 9000<00:01:05.159> would<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.460> easy

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
going up to Mars Hal 9000 would be easy

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.520 
going up to Mars Hal 9000 would be easy
it's<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.920> more<00:01:08.310> complex<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.570> mean<00:01:09.810> good

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's way more complex and I mean good

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's way more complex and I mean good
put<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> Hal<00:01:11.130> 9000<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> shame<00:01:11.909> yeah<00:01:12.740> okay<00:01:13.740> that's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
put in Hal 9000 a shame yeah okay that's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
put in Hal 9000 a shame yeah okay that's
some<00:01:14.130> seriously<00:01:14.790> powerful<00:01:14.930> stuff<00:01:15.960> our

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
some seriously powerful stuff our

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.940 
some seriously powerful stuff our
biggest<00:01:17.220> existential<00:01:17.840> threat<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.320> artificial

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
biggest existential threat is artificial

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
biggest existential threat is artificial
intelligence<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.479> quote

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
intelligence and it will be like quote

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.719 
intelligence and it will be like quote
summoning<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> demon<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.469 
the robots are going to take over and
yes<00:01:56.340> I've<00:01:56.520> watched<00:01:56.729> enough<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> sci-fi

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
yes I've watched enough of the sci-fi

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
yes I've watched enough of the sci-fi
movies<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
movies it's it's just in there it's just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
movies it's it's just in there it's just
a<00:01:59.460> piece<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.149> doesn't<00:02:00.450> mean<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.659> stop

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
a piece and that doesn't mean we stop

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.230 
a piece and that doesn't mean we stop
technology<00:02:01.799> stop<00:02:02.159> moving<00:02:02.430> forward<00:02:02.790> or<00:02:02.939> all

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
technology stop moving forward or all

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
technology stop moving forward or all
this<00:02:03.360> future<00:02:03.719> stuff<00:02:03.750> which<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.380> really

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
this future stuff which is all really

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.280 
this future stuff which is all really
cool<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.909> how<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.299> heed<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> warning<00:02:07.140> from

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
cool but how do we heed a warning from

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.350 
cool but how do we heed a warning from
this<00:02:07.560> guy<00:02:07.799> he's<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> one<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:08.789> doing<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
this guy he's the one that's doing it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
you know he's one of the Primo guys but

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300 
you know he's one of the Primo guys but
how<00:02:13.960> do<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.110> how<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:14.530> we<00:02:14.710> acknowledge<00:02:15.280> that

how do we how do we acknowledge that
it's<00:02:15.490> happening<00:02:16.030> while<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.600> technology<00:02:16.930> just

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
it's happening while the technology just

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's happening while the technology just
keeps<00:02:17.560> moving<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:19.360> we<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.750> don't

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
keeps moving on what do we do I don't

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.450 
keeps moving on what do we do I don't

know if he fuck with some artificial

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.800 
know if he fuck with some artificial
intelligent<00:02:30.490> rat<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.150> he<00:02:31.270> created<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.690> his

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
intelligent rat that he created in his

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050 
intelligent rat that he created in his
back<00:02:32.080> room<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.440> stole<00:02:32.800> from<00:02:33.100> him<00:02:33.370> yeah<00:02:33.880> you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
back room that stole from him yeah you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820 
back room that stole from him yeah you
know<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.360> some<00:02:34.600> micro<00:02:34.960> level<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.470> he's<00:02:35.680> like

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
know on some micro level and he's like

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.680 
know on some micro level and he's like
oh<00:02:35.980> shit<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.270> weighted<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
oh shit so like the weighted the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.650 
oh shit so like the weighted the
gravitas<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.740> which<00:02:39.130> he<00:02:39.310> spoke<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.330> scares

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
gravitas in which he spoke that scares

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.050 
gravitas in which he spoke that scares
me<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.470> that's<00:02:41.650> what<00:02:41.860> yeah<00:02:42.040> III<00:02:42.460> was<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
me so that that's what yeah III was the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.970 
me so that that's what yeah III was the
matter<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.510> fact<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.050> which<00:02:44.230> with<00:02:44.560> which<00:02:44.800> he

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
matter of fact this which with which he

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.440 
matter of fact this which with which he
said<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.250> because<00:02:45.460> he's<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> one<00:02:45.880> building

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
said it because he's the one building

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.570 
said it because he's the one building
this<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.050> technology<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.220> happen

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
this the technology for this happen

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.100 
this the technology for this happen
Google's<00:02:48.910> got<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.210> know<00:02:49.300> Ray<00:02:49.450> Kurzweil<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
Google's got you know Ray Kurzweil the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.620 
Google's got you know Ray Kurzweil the
singularity<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:50.740> all<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.100> uh<00:02:51.520> but<00:02:52.300> he's<00:02:52.480> one

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
singularity and all that uh but he's one

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.940 
singularity and all that uh but he's one
of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.750> ones<00:02:52.870> doing<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.440> because<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.920> that

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
of the ones doing it so because of that

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.070 
of the ones doing it so because of that
he<00:02:54.280> said<00:02:54.490> it's<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:54.790> calculatingly<00:02:55.570> like<00:02:55.840> this

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
he said it's so calculatingly like this

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.920 
he said it's so calculatingly like this
shit<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.680> going<00:02:57.220> down<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.880> humans<00:02:58.300> enjoy<00:02:58.630> why

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
shit is going down so humans enjoy why

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.270 
shit is going down so humans enjoy why
you<00:02:58.990> got<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.410> cuz<00:02:59.530> we<00:02:59.650> got<00:02:59.740> about<00:02:59.950> 10<00:03:00.160> years

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
you got it cuz we got about 10 years

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.920 
you got it cuz we got about 10 years
left<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> think<00:03:01.120> with<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.330> subject<00:03:01.720> yeah

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
left and I think with the subject yeah

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.020 
left and I think with the subject yeah
and<00:03:02.230> even<00:03:02.530> brought<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.830> movies<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:03.640> see

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
and even brought the movies that we see

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.580 
and even brought the movies that we see
is<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.330> all<00:03:04.510> yeah<00:03:04.720> that'll<00:03:05.050> never<00:03:05.170> happen

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
is this all yeah that'll never happen

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.740 
is this all yeah that'll never happen
yeah<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.070> then<00:03:06.250> again<00:03:06.460> wasn't<00:03:06.970> joking<00:03:07.450> wasn't

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
yeah but then again wasn't joking wasn't

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.600 
yeah but then again wasn't joking wasn't
smiling<00:03:07.900> about<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.470> again<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.460> then

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
smiling about it so again and then

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.460 
smiling about it so again and then
they're<00:03:09.790> recreating<00:03:10.210> humans<00:03:10.870> evidence<00:03:11.230> for<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
they're recreating humans evidence for a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
they're recreating humans evidence for a
while<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.040> even<00:03:12.280> ago<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.820> mean<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.210> have<00:03:13.390> these

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
while and even ago I mean you have these

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.330 
while and even ago I mean you have these
innovators<00:03:14.020> then<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.740> even<00:03:14.980> people<00:03:15.220> who

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
innovators then you have even people who

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.800 
innovators then you have even people who
are<00:03:15.459> more<00:03:15.580> religious<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.150> grew<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.480> Christian

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
are more religious I grew up Christian

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.199 
are more religious I grew up Christian
as<00:03:16.870> well<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:18.010> when<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.520> have<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.760> then

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
as well and so when you have it then

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.900 
as well and so when you have it then
they<00:03:19.570> think<00:03:19.630> hey<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.350> what<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.760> guys

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
they think hey you know what you guys

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.400 
they think hey you know what you guys
got<00:03:22.120> look<00:03:22.300> up<00:03:22.450> for<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.690> you're<00:03:22.870> creating<00:03:23.050> cuz

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
got look up for what you're creating cuz

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.510 
got look up for what you're creating cuz
then<00:03:23.530> they're<00:03:23.620> gonna<00:03:23.740> come<00:03:23.950> back<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.280> get<00:03:24.370> you

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
then they're gonna come back and get you

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.010 
then they're gonna come back and get you
I<00:03:24.550> mean<00:03:24.730> whatever<00:03:25.060> really<00:03:25.510> want<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.750> bring<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
I mean whatever really want to bring it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.140 
I mean whatever really want to bring it
back<00:03:26.110> from<00:03:26.410> my<00:03:27.130> past<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.550> not<00:03:27.730> me<00:03:29.880> that's<00:03:30.880> good

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
back from my past is not me that's good

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.270 
back from my past is not me that's good
yeah<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.410> seems<00:03:32.590> like<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.800> creation<00:03:33.100> of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
yeah so it seems like the creation of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.940 
yeah so it seems like the creation of
this<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.550> do<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.090> make<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.450> superbeing<00:03:35.290> yeah

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
this to do is to make a superbeing yeah

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.980 
this to do is to make a superbeing yeah
and<00:03:36.280> that's<00:03:36.520> what<00:03:36.730> obviously<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.360> mean<00:03:37.630> these

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
and that's what obviously I mean these

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.300 
and that's what obviously I mean these
companies<00:03:38.350> in<00:03:38.560> these<00:03:38.650> corporations<00:03:39.190> these

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
companies in these corporations these

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.430 
companies in these corporations these
innovators<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:39.850> said<00:03:40.060> they<00:03:40.180> want<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.420> do<00:03:40.600> and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
innovators have said they want to do and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.380 
innovators have said they want to do and
then<00:03:41.620> what<00:03:41.770> do<00:03:41.830> we<00:03:41.860> do<00:03:42.070> with<00:03:42.190> those<00:03:42.400> what's<00:03:43.270> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
then what do we do with those what's the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.850 
then what do we do with those what's the
point<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:43.900> control<00:03:44.260> them<00:03:44.500> well<00:03:44.680> I've

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
point of it so control them well I've

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.650 
point of it so control them well I've
created<00:03:45.070> on<00:03:45.310> yeah<00:03:45.640> do<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.120> need<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.420> pay<00:03:46.630> more

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
created on yeah do we need to pay more

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.540 
created on yeah do we need to pay more
attention<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.380> science<00:03:47.890> fiction<00:03:48.250> because

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
attention to science fiction because

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.520 
attention to science fiction because
science<00:03:48.820> fiction<00:03:49.150> usually<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.810> about<00:03:49.959> 50

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
science fiction usually is about 50

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.860 
science fiction usually is about 50
years<00:03:50.739> ahead<00:03:50.890> of<00:03:51.360> what<00:03:52.360> ends<00:03:52.720> up<00:03:52.810> happening

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
years ahead of what ends up happening

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.320 
years ahead of what ends up happening
you<00:03:53.560> know<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.550> seems<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.970> me<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.300> be

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
you know that that seems to me to be

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.120 
you know that that seems to me to be
like<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.690> rough<00:03:56.020> arc<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.709> get<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:57.040> this

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
like a rough arc that you get with this

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.800 
like a rough arc that you get with this
stuff<00:03:57.340> in<00:03:57.459> all<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.910> these<00:03:58.030> movies<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.570> got

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
in all this stuff so science it does

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.729 
in all this stuff so science it does
give<00:04:13.969> us<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.150> little<00:04:14.360> bit<00:04:14.629> of<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.810> key<00:04:15.079> right<00:04:15.560> it

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
give us a little bit of a key right it

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.110 
give us a little bit of a key right it
always<00:04:15.890> goes<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.370> bad<00:04:16.579> place<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:17.060> suppose

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
always goes to the bad place I suppose

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180 
always goes to the bad place I suppose
maybe<00:04:17.690> we<00:04:17.870> need<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.470> there<00:04:18.709> could<00:04:18.889> they<00:04:19.039> do<00:04:19.160> a

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
maybe we need is there could they do a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.439 
maybe we need is there could they do a
science<00:04:19.519> fiction<00:04:19.609> movie<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:20.060> does<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:20.359> ever

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
science fiction movie that does it ever

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.969 
science fiction movie that does it ever
work<00:04:20.509> out<00:04:20.840> innocent<00:04:21.350> why<00:04:21.410> does<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.620> never<00:04:21.769> work

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
work out innocent why does it never work

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.040 
work out innocent why does it never work
out<00:04:22.130> why<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.400> Futurists<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.449> never<00:04:23.660> works<00:04:23.870> out

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
out why the Futurists it never works out

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.080 
out why the Futurists it never works out
I<00:04:24.229> feel<00:04:24.680> like<00:04:25.600> in<00:04:26.600> in<00:04:27.440> our<00:04:27.850> reality<00:04:28.850> in<00:04:29.000> our

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
I feel like in in our reality in our

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.510 
I feel like in in our reality in our
world<00:04:29.419> I<00:04:29.720> think<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.259> there<00:04:31.130> are<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:31.430> many

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
world I think that there are so many

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.120 
world I think that there are so many
checks<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.030> balances<00:04:32.509> and<00:04:32.979> technology<00:04:33.979> can

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
checks and balances and technology can

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.920 
checks and balances and technology can
move<00:04:34.430> such<00:04:34.610> an<00:04:34.699> incremental<00:04:35.120> pace<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.810> if

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
move such an incremental pace that if

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.120 
move such an incremental pace that if
something<00:04:36.199> really<00:04:36.380> does<00:04:36.800> prove<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:37.100> be

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
something really does prove to be

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.529 
something really does prove to be
dangerous<00:04:37.280> they'll<00:04:37.850> shut<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.090> down<00:04:38.210> like

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
dangerous they'll shut it down like

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.439 
dangerous they'll shut it down like
drone<00:04:38.930> like<00:04:39.229> drones<00:04:39.860> from<00:04:40.340> Amazon<00:04:41.030> right

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
drone like drones from Amazon right

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.839 
drone like drones from Amazon right
that's<00:04:42.110> that's<00:04:42.680> just<00:04:42.800> being<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:43.370> being<00:04:43.490> beta

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
that's that's just being it's being beta

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.210 
that's that's just being it's being beta
tested<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.449> being<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:45.110> don't<00:04:45.229> feel<00:04:45.680> like<00:04:45.830> but

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
tested it's being I don't feel like but

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.830 
tested it's being I don't feel like but
also<00:04:46.370> they're<00:04:46.789> gonna<00:04:46.910> become<00:04:47.210> smarter<00:04:47.630> that

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
also they're gonna become smarter that

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.719 
also they're gonna become smarter that
they'll<00:04:47.990> shut<00:04:48.229> us<00:04:48.259> down<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.680> think<00:04:48.979> that<00:04:49.130> that's

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
they'll shut us down I think that that's

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.370 
they'll shut us down I think that that's
the<00:04:49.970> fear<00:04:50.150> they<00:04:50.300> feel<00:04:50.539> like<00:04:50.690> though<00:04:50.960> are<00:04:51.289> we

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
the fear they feel like though are we

screw up actual physical real-world

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.399 
screw up actual physical real-world
things<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:53.330> know<00:05:53.449> they<00:05:53.720> through<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:53.960> computer

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
things you know they through a computer

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.379 
things you know they through a computer
virus<00:05:54.530> they<00:05:55.039> then<00:05:55.220> made<00:05:55.490> you<00:05:56.000> know<00:05:56.120> things

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
virus they then made you know things

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.450 
virus they then made you know things
spin<00:05:56.780> too<00:05:56.990> fast<00:05:57.289> or<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.800> actually<00:05:57.979> caused

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
spin too fast or and it actually caused

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.490 
spin too fast or and it actually caused
real<00:05:58.849> explosions<00:05:59.570> like<00:05:59.720> so<00:05:59.900> it's<00:06:00.080> it's

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
real explosions like so it's it's

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.930 
real explosions like so it's it's
happening<00:06:01.039> right<00:06:01.220> now<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.580> I<00:06:01.639> guess<00:06:01.789> we<00:06:01.909> just
