00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you can see most most of the body work

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.759 
you can see most most of the body work
is<00:01:01.739> done<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.309> most<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> still<00:01:03.719> still<00:01:04.589> got

is done on it most of it still still got
some<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.360> imperfections<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> don't

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
some little imperfections that I don't

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.640 
some little imperfections that I don't
like<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:08.750> also<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.990> another<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.560> these

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
like I also got another one of these

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
like I also got another one of these
right<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> top<00:01:12.530> because<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:13.680> an

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
right here at the top because that's an

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
right here at the top because that's an
experiment<00:01:14.659> actually<00:01:15.659> God<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.110> his

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
experiment actually God want his

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.570 
experiment actually God want his
experiment<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.490> of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
experiment and as you can see I kind of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
experiment and as you can see I kind of
cut<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.540> too<00:01:18.659> big<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.340> here

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
cut this a little bit too big right here

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.539 
cut this a little bit too big right here
in<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> end<00:01:21.950> try<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.369> no<00:01:23.430> way

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
in this end try see if I there's no way

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.289 
in this end try see if I there's no way
I<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.390> flush<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.090> said<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
I can make it more flush but as I said I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
I can make it more flush but as I said I
still<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.810> its<00:01:28.439> lab<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.829> still<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.159> actually

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
still have its lab I still have actually

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
still have its lab I still have actually
three<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> these<00:01:30.259> still<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.500> original

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
three of these still have my original

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
three of these still have my original
which<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:32.939> cut

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
which you know I'm not on I don't cut

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
which you know I'm not on I don't cut
that<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:35.390> looks<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> mean<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> most

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that up looks but I mean for the most

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.969 
that up looks but I mean for the most
part<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> functions<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.060> works<00:01:39.799> as<00:01:40.799> I'm

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
part of functions they see works as I'm

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
part of functions they see works as I'm
noted<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.939> my<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.150> video<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.259> three

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
noted in my other video that the three

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.530 
noted in my other video that the three
lights<00:01:43.770> right<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.880> indicator<00:01:45.299> lights

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
lights right here the indicator lights

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
lights right here the indicator lights
on<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.020> course<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> find<00:01:47.790> me<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.030> actual

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
on of course I got to find me an actual

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
on of course I got to find me an actual
law<00:01:48.540> few<00:01:49.200> LED<00:01:49.619> lights<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.130> those<00:01:50.340> work

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
law few LED lights to make those work

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
law few LED lights to make those work
but<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> most<00:01:52.200> part<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
but as you see it for the most part of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.990 
but as you see it for the most part of
its<00:01:52.590> run<00:01:52.710> ignition<00:01:53.130> on

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
its run ignition on

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.040 
its run ignition on
was<00:01:56.000> work<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:01.190> only<00:02:01.370> way<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.550> see<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:01.880> my<00:02:02.540> AC<00:02:02.780> is

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
was work the only way to see if my AC is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.960 
was work the only way to see if my AC is
on<00:02:03.170> front<00:02:03.710> works<00:02:05.920> actually<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.280> lights<00:02:07.640> in

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
on front works actually have lights in

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.430 
on front works actually have lights in
here<00:02:08.530> that's<00:02:09.530> actually<00:02:09.920> from<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.540> board<00:02:11.540> as<00:02:12.260> I

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
here that's actually from the board as I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.100 
here that's actually from the board as I
kind<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.770> messed<00:02:13.100> my<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.340> other<00:02:13.550> video<00:02:13.870> see<00:02:14.870> it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
kind of messed my the other video see it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.940 
kind of messed my the other video see it
my<00:02:15.290> C's<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:16.700> my<00:02:16.990> circulations<00:02:17.990> on<00:02:18.200> my<00:02:18.650> where
