00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a low it's been compared to saying it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.110 
a low it's been compared to saying it's
pretty<00:00:33.120> much<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> macbook<00:00:33.870> pro<00:00:34.410> rip<00:00:34.710> off<00:00:34.890> um<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
pretty much a macbook pro rip off um you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.910 
pretty much a macbook pro rip off um you
can<00:00:36.300> decide<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.780> yourself<00:00:37.170> by<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.530> looking<00:00:37.829> at

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
can decide for yourself by me looking at

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
can decide for yourself by me looking at
this<00:00:38.010> images<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.149> google<00:00:39.570> macbook

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
this images go get a go google macbook

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.190 
this images go get a go google macbook
pro<00:00:40.290> image<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.250> compare<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
pro image and you can compare to it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.180 
pro image and you can compare to it
obviously<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> mouse<00:00:43.559> doesn't<00:00:43.860> look<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
obviously the mouse doesn't look the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.510 
obviously the mouse doesn't look the
same<00:00:44.219> day<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.910> apples<00:00:45.780> patent<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.829> mouse<00:00:47.489> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
same day I apples patent the mouse is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.180 
same day I apples patent the mouse is
obviously<00:00:48.270> different<00:00:48.950> now<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.100> really

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
obviously different now I'm not really

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.160 
obviously different now I'm not really
sure<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> multi<00:00:51.149> touch<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.050> know

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
sure this is a multi touch of you know

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.650 
sure this is a multi touch of you know
most<00:00:53.010> pad<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.910> assume<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.510> got<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
most pad but I would assume so you got a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
most pad but I would assume so you got a
lock<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.289> side<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> trick

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
lock on the side and you go to trick

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.900 
lock on the side and you go to trick
like<00:00:56.670> keys<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> nice<00:00:57.960> um<00:00:58.910> now

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
weird I'm it on the side there I would

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.460 
weird I'm it on the side there I would
think<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> they<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:18.720> put<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.229> summer

up here all these buns like I think they

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.870 
up here all these buns like I think they
could<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.770> displayed<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.280> could<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> think

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
could have displayed I could I think

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.340 
could have displayed I could I think
they<00:01:23.970> could<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> buttons<00:01:25.170> better

they could do put all the buttons better
here's<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> display<00:01:26.700> um<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.270> basically<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
here's the display um so basically the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
here's the display um so basically the
envy<00:01:28.049> 15<00:01:28.470> comes<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.890> display<00:01:29.280> resolution<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
envy 15 comes with display resolution of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.810 
envy 15 comes with display resolution of
1366<00:01:30.750> x<00:01:31.400> 768<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.829> upgrade<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> 1080p

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
1366 x 768 so you can upgrade to a 1080p

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
1366 x 768 so you can upgrade to a 1080p
radiance<00:01:36.420> display<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.110> extra<00:01:37.320> hundred

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's quite nice 1080p I think that would

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
it's quite nice 1080p I think that would
be<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.439> nice<00:01:43.710> um<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.430> yeah<00:01:44.579> looking<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
front view of it um i got this does

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.030 
front view of it um i got this does
resemble<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.759> macbook<00:01:48.630> pro<00:01:48.930> whether<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.920> can

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
