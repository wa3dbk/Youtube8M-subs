that's the uproar not beat up rock and
actually<00:00:22.580> these<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> ear<00:00:24.810> headphones

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
actually these are on the ear headphones

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
actually these are on the ear headphones
that<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.449> replacing<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> up<00:00:27.779> rock<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that are replacing the up rock and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.800 
that are replacing the up rock and
they've<00:00:28.800> made<00:00:29.330> definitely<00:00:30.330> made<00:00:30.570> some

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
they've made definitely made some

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.380 
they've made definitely made some
improvements<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> price<00:00:32.700> tag<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.210> them

improvements and the price tag on them
are<00:00:33.530> $34.99<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.030> expensive<00:00:36.540> headset

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
are $34.99 so not an expensive headset

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.810 
are $34.99 so not an expensive headset
so<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.309> compared<00:00:38.730> with

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so these are not to be compared with

so these are not to be compared with
much<00:00:39.300> more<00:00:39.540> expensive<00:00:39.809> headsets<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.829> going

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to get into if I think the $35 is worth

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.639 
to get into if I think the $35 is worth
it<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.149> getting<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.809> let's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
case the cable is not detachable so we

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689

however go right into the headphones

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.939 
however go right into the headphones
themselves<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.199> they're

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
themselves and as you can see they're

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.080 
themselves and as you can see they're
not<00:01:05.339> large<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.740> they<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.799> resemble<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.909> up

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

rock<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> certain<00:01:11.040> extent<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> think

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
rock to a certain extent but I think

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260 
rock to a certain extent but I think
Skull<00:01:12.689> Candy<00:01:12.960> definitely<00:01:13.799> made<00:01:14.070> some<00:01:14.270> really

big<00:01:15.420> improvements<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.310> rock<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
big improvements from the up rock to the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.530 
big improvements from the up rock to the
new<00:01:18.210> uproar<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.759> start<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.270> with

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
new uproar and to kind of start off with

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.179 
new uproar and to kind of start off with
that<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.439> plastic<00:01:23.189> build<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.420> these<00:01:25.189> actually

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that the plastic build of these actually

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.240 
that the plastic build of these actually
don't<00:01:26.490> seem<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.030> fragile<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:27.930> think

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
ear they actually give you a pretty good

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.800 
ear they actually give you a pretty good
seal<00:02:11.129> where<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> blocks<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> lot<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
seal where it blocks out a lot of the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.460 
seal where it blocks out a lot of the
noise<00:02:12.959> or

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
noise or

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.980 
noise or
so<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.010> far<00:02:14.190> as<00:02:14.250> noise<00:02:14.730> isolation<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
so as far as noise isolation these do a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.440 
so as far as noise isolation these do a
pretty<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:16.740> job<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:18.120> headphones

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
pretty good job on the headphones

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.840 
pretty good job on the headphones

little Skullcandy logo the cable on them

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
little Skullcandy logo the cable on them
are<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.350> detachable<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.280> they're<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.790> both

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
are not detachable and they're on both

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.330 
are not detachable and they're on both
sides<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> ears<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.380> doesn't<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.220> know

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
sides of the ears so it doesn't you know

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.680 
sides of the ears so it doesn't you know
it<00:02:35.430> doesn't<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.820> come<00:02:35.970> out<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.510> side

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
it doesn't just come out of one side

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.050 
it doesn't just come out of one side
you've<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.440> both<00:02:37.710> but<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.670> flat

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
you've got it on both but it's the flat

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.450 
you've got it on both but it's the flat
cable<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.190> there's<00:02:41.400> a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
cable and as you can see there's a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.850 
cable and as you can see there's a
little<00:02:41.730> bit<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:42.060> tangle<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.620> bad

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
little bit of tangle but just not as bad

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.220 
little bit of tangle but just not as bad
as<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.400> were<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:45.660> rounded<00:02:46.080> off

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
as if they were the more rounded off

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.400 
as if they were the more rounded off
cables<00:02:46.770> it's<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.160> braided<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.120> rubber

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
cables it's not braided it's the rubber

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.600 
cables it's not braided it's the rubber
so<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.920> kind<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.250> keep<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.550> in

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
so you do have to kind of keep that in

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.510 
so you do have to kind of keep that in
mind<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.540> part<00:02:51.870> breaks<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:53.280> can't

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
mind that if that part breaks you can't

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.030 
mind that if that part breaks you can't
really<00:02:53.790> replace<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> cables<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:55.290> there

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
really replace it the cables in there

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.090 
really replace it the cables in there
it's<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.340> stuck<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.320> on<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.830> left

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it's just stuck in there on the left

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880 
it's just stuck in there on the left
side<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.790> see<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.420> little<00:03:00.930> tiny<00:03:01.080> pinhole

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
side you can see the little tiny pinhole

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.970 
side you can see the little tiny pinhole
that's<00:03:02.550> where<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.210> mic<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:04.200> located<00:03:04.860> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that's where your mic is located and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.270 
that's where your mic is located and
that's<00:03:05.400> important<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:07.140> these<00:03:07.800> like

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
that's important because on these like

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.740 
that's important because on these like
on<00:03:08.460> headphones<00:03:08.730> you're<00:03:09.090> used<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:09.690> of

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
on headphones you're used to kind of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.940 
on headphones you're used to kind of
seeing<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> little<00:03:10.290> thing<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.770> can

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
seeing the little thing that you can

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.430 
seeing the little thing that you can
pause<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.700> skip<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
pause and skip and do all that on the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.860 
pause and skip and do all that on the
cable<00:03:13.890> they<00:03:14.820> don't<00:03:15.000> do<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.450> cable<00:03:15.750> on

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
cable they don't do that on the cable on

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.630 
cable they don't do that on the cable on
these<00:03:16.020> they're<00:03:16.500> actually<00:03:16.920> built<00:03:17.130> onto<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.740 
don't stick out far they really conform
to<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:48.959> head<00:03:49.170> pretty<00:03:49.620> well<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:51.270> controls

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
to your head pretty well the controls

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.330 
to your head pretty well the controls
are<00:03:52.050> right<00:03:52.320> there<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.920> don't<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.250> go

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
are right there so you don't have to go

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.860 
are right there so you don't have to go
digging<00:03:53.640> around<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.150> trying<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.420> find<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.780> on

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
digging around and trying to find it on

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.020 
digging around and trying to find it on
the<00:03:54.900> cable<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.680> right<00:03:55.920> there<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.489> as

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the cable it's just right there and as

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.760 
the cable it's just right there and as
you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.300> see<00:03:57.570> when<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.780> extended<00:03:58.320> these<00:03:58.530> out

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
you can see when I extended these out

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.540 
you can see when I extended these out
its<00:03:59.040> plastic<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.570> inside<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:02.280> thing

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
its plastic on the inside so this thing

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.210 
its plastic on the inside so this thing
is<00:04:02.790> completely<00:04:02.989> plastic<00:04:03.989> head<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.830> toe<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
is completely plastic head to toe and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.670 
is completely plastic head to toe and
that's<00:04:05.940> kind<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.450> important<00:04:06.959> because<00:04:07.140> again

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
that's kind of important because again

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.280 
that's kind of important because again
if<00:04:08.160> you're<00:04:09.060> using<00:04:09.330> them<00:04:09.570> for<00:04:09.600> certain<00:04:10.080> things

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
if you're using them for certain things

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.290 
if you're using them for certain things
you<00:04:10.650> might<00:04:10.980> have<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.520> worry<00:04:11.910> about<00:04:12.060> the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
you might have to worry about the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.490 
you might have to worry about the
durability<00:04:12.720> but<00:04:13.709> for<00:04:13.950> overall<00:04:14.250> use<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:15.500> think

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
durability but for overall use I think

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.479 
durability but for overall use I think
they'll<00:04:16.620> hold<00:04:16.770> up<00:04:16.890> pretty<00:04:17.040> well<00:04:18.230> now<00:04:19.230> on<00:04:19.680> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
they'll hold up pretty well now on to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.180 
they'll hold up pretty well now on to
the<00:04:20.940> sound<00:04:21.209> which<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.200> most<00:04:22.620> important

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
the sound which is the most important

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.330 
the sound which is the most important
part<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.820> headphone

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
part of the headphone

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.040 
part of the headphone
doesn't<00:04:24.940> matter<00:04:25.060> if<00:04:25.270> you're<00:04:25.420> comfortable<00:04:25.690> if

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
doesn't matter if you're comfortable if

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.780 
doesn't matter if you're comfortable if
they<00:04:26.170> sound<00:04:26.350> like<00:04:26.590> crap<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:27.550> for<00:04:28.080> $35<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.790> can

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
they sound like crap but for $35 I can

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.350 
they sound like crap but for $35 I can
say<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.930> have<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.410> keep<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.740> $35<00:04:33.430> part<00:04:34.150> in

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
say and you have to keep the $35 part in

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.720 
say and you have to keep the $35 part in
mind<00:04:34.660> because<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.380> can't<00:04:35.740> again<00:04:36.160> compare

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
mind because you can't again compare

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.790 
mind because you can't again compare
them<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:36.910> things<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.360> are<00:04:37.720> three<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.770> four

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
them to things that are three to four

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800 
them to things that are three to four
times<00:04:39.250> as<00:04:39.460> much<00:04:39.610> Skullcandy<00:04:40.300> has<00:04:40.510> some

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
times as much Skullcandy has some

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.420 
times as much Skullcandy has some
higher-end<00:04:41.560> headphones<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.370> are

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
higher-end headphones that are

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.830 
higher-end headphones that are
ridiculous<00:04:43.090> but<00:04:43.990> these<00:04:44.260> for<00:04:44.650> $35<00:04:45.400> and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
ridiculous but these for $35 and

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.720 
ridiculous but these for $35 and
especially<00:04:46.840> if<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.380> like<00:04:47.620> bass<00:04:47.919> you're

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
especially if you like bass you're

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.020 
especially if you like bass you're
getting<00:04:49.060> your<00:04:49.180> money's<00:04:49.419> worth<00:04:49.450> now<00:04:51.030> audio

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
getting your money's worth now audio

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.730 
getting your money's worth now audio
files<00:04:52.360> are<00:04:52.630> people<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.960> are<00:04:53.020> really<00:04:53.380> picky

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
files are people that are really picky

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.310 
files are people that are really picky
about<00:04:53.770> some<00:04:54.220> sound<00:04:54.700> may<00:04:55.660> not<00:04:55.690> want<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.050> go<00:04:56.139> with

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
about some sound may not want to go with

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.830 
about some sound may not want to go with
these<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.890> say<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.400> because<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:58.300> base<00:04:58.600> is

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
these and I say that because the base is

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.260 
these and I say that because the base is
so<00:04:59.380> prominent<00:04:59.800> that<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:01.390> highs<00:05:02.020> are<00:05:02.500> really

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
so prominent that the highs are really

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.350 
so prominent that the highs are really
really<00:05:04.270> laid-back<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.560> it's<00:05:05.770> not<00:05:06.010> as<00:05:06.340> clean<00:05:07.120> as

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
really laid-back so it's not as clean as

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.880 
really laid-back so it's not as clean as
most<00:05:07.840> headphones

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
most headphones

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.010 
most headphones
I'd<00:05:09.130> say<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.520> sound<00:05:09.760> signature<00:05:10.480> starts<00:05:10.900> with

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
I'd say the sound signature starts with

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.600 
I'd say the sound signature starts with
the<00:05:11.110> treble<00:05:11.320> here<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:11.919> just<00:05:12.310> kind<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.490> go

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
the treble here and just kind of go

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.780 
the treble here and just kind of go
straight<00:05:12.669> up<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.240> base<00:05:13.600> in<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:14.530> just<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.550> that

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
straight up to base in that just in that

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.469 
straight up to base in that just in that
straight<00:05:16.180> line<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.720> with<00:05:17.229> saying<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.800> I

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
straight line and with saying that I

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.000 
straight line and with saying that I
think<00:05:19.479> these<00:05:19.630> headphones<00:05:19.960> are<00:05:20.440> built<00:05:20.830> and

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
think these headphones are built and

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.030 
think these headphones are built and
geared<00:05:21.400> towards<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.750> very<00:05:23.290> young<00:05:23.620> demographic

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
geared towards a very young demographic

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.940 
geared towards a very young demographic
so<00:05:24.880> as<00:05:25.030> far<00:05:25.270> as<00:05:25.389> like<00:05:25.570> top<00:05:25.840> 40<00:05:26.290> type<00:05:26.470> music

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
so as far as like top 40 type music

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.580 
so as far as like top 40 type music
anything<00:05:27.850> with<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.900> lot<00:05:29.200> of<00:05:29.350> bass<00:05:29.560> rap<00:05:31.590> anything

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
anything with a lot of bass rap anything

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.920 
anything with a lot of bass rap anything
it's<00:05:33.160> there<00:05:33.490> like<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:34.000> bass<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.510> there<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:34.870> it

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
it's there like the bass is there and it

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.909 
it's there like the bass is there and it
sounds<00:05:35.500> good

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
sounds good

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.630 
sounds good
for<00:05:36.310> those<00:05:36.940> genres<00:05:37.479> of<00:05:37.690> music<00:05:37.840> now<00:05:38.560> rock<00:05:39.340> I

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
for those genres of music now rock I

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.360 
for those genres of music now rock I
thought<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.479> these<00:05:40.630> definitely<00:05:41.440> didn't<00:05:42.100> fit

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
thought that these definitely didn't fit

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.969 
thought that these definitely didn't fit
very<00:05:42.640> well<00:05:43.150> with<00:05:43.510> that<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:44.500> again<00:05:44.740> that's

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
very well with that and again that's

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.279 
very well with that and again that's
because<00:05:45.130> you<00:05:46.000> want<00:05:46.330> your<00:05:46.510> treble<00:05:46.900> in<00:05:47.020> your<00:05:47.140> mid

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
because you want your treble in your mid

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.200 
because you want your treble in your mid
to<00:05:47.440> come<00:05:47.620> out<00:05:47.770> more<00:05:48.039> and<00:05:48.340> these<00:05:48.940> headphones

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
to come out more and these headphones

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.969 
to come out more and these headphones
just<00:05:49.930> don't<00:05:50.200> do<00:05:50.500> that

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
just don't do that

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.550 
just don't do that
but<00:05:52.380> overall<00:05:53.380> value<00:05:53.860> was<00:05:54.070> for<00:05:54.340> $35<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:56.110> think
