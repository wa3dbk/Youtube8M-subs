00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.600
 unlocking giving us these four 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.910
 options and the truth is that it is very 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.609
 interesting that very similar to what it is 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.350
 this phones this one they carry 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.820
 for your Android operation as you can 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.040
 know and good about these four options 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.840
 one of them is to unlock this 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.600
 leaving us to youtube the others only 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.370
 unlock the other is to be able to send a 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.050
 message and the other on a page 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.480
 internet at this time let's see what 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.059
 What is YouTube and how can you see it? 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.010
 easy and simple operation of 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.719
 this tweet we are going to use another 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.390
 function for example let's use the 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.309
 of message and not knowing it are to be able to 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.649
 sending a new message is a truth 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.000
 the option is also very good and good 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.379
 of the browser not knowing what the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
 Home in this case I have 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.520
 google as the main page and as 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 can see here is in a very function 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.240
 good the truth because in the part of what 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.039
 that we can access multiple options 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.590

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.950

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.159
 free in the weak voice Syrian repute that 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.409
