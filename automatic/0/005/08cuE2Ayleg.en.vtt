really<00:00:20.369> easy<00:00:20.550> I've<00:00:20.820> been<00:00:20.970> braiding<00:00:21.240> hair

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
really easy I've been braiding hair

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790 
really easy I've been braiding hair
since<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:21.930> little<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.470> my<00:00:22.650> mom

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
since I was really little because my mom

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.230 
since I was really little because my mom
always<00:00:23.070> braided<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:23.550> hair<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:23.939> younger

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
always braided my hair and I was younger

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.029 
always braided my hair and I was younger
and<00:00:24.539> taught<00:00:25.260> me<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:25.890> really

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and taught me to do it when I was really

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
and taught me to do it when I was really
young<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.609> um<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> lot<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> people<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.140> is

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
young so um for a lot of people this is

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
young so um for a lot of people this is
probably<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:28.710> redundant<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.670> mean

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
probably really redundant but I mean

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
probably really redundant but I mean
there<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.359> tips<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> tricks<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
there is some tips and tricks with this

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
there is some tips and tricks with this
video<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.090> layered<00:00:33.390> hair

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
video on if you have layered hair

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.750 
video on if you have layered hair
because<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.559> lot<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.800> shorter

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
because I do have a lot of shorter

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.130 
because I do have a lot of shorter
layers<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.450> layers<00:00:36.690> framing<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.110> face

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
layers so I have layers framing my face

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
layers so I have layers framing my face
and<00:00:37.770> they're<00:00:37.980> longer<00:00:38.250> layers<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.910> super

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and they're longer layers I'm not super

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.240 
and they're longer layers I'm not super
long<00:00:39.360> super<00:00:39.899> short<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> do

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
long super short but as you see I do

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.410 
long super short but as you see I do
have<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.210> they

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
have some that kind of go like they

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.790 
have some that kind of go like they
start<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
start in down here all the way to the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.490 
start in down here all the way to the
bottom<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> harder<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> braid

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
bottom so it is kind of harder to braid

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
bottom so it is kind of harder to braid
hair<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.309> layered<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
hair that is layered so this is how you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
hair that is layered so this is how you
can<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.680> side<00:00:50.129> braid<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.610> mean<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> could<00:00:51.000> do

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
can do a side braid I mean you could do

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.840 
can do a side braid I mean you could do
this<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.860> regular<00:00:52.860> pigtail<00:00:53.460> braids<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

front piece back to the middle and pull
the<00:02:37.930> middle<00:02:38.110> piece<00:02:38.410> forwards<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the middle piece forwards and then the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.030 
the middle piece forwards and then the
back<00:02:40.090> piece<00:02:40.390> towards<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.959> middle<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
back piece towards the middle and the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430 
back piece towards the middle and the
middle<00:02:42.370> piece<00:02:42.610> again<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.690> middle<00:02:43.989> again

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
middle piece again to the middle again

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.750 
middle piece again to the middle again
so<00:02:45.069> you're<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.459> keep<00:02:45.550> switching

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
so you're just going to keep switching

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.830 
so you're just going to keep switching

to middle and back to middle and just

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.680 
to middle and back to middle and just
keep<00:02:53.380> rotating<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.250> as<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.580> go<00:02:54.730> along<00:02:54.850> so

going to do you're always going to want
to<00:03:00.700> start<00:03:00.940> with<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> front<00:03:01.450> piece<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.959> pull

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
to start with the front piece and pull

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.930 
to start with the front piece and pull
it<00:03:02.230> back<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.709> middle<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:03.670> pull<00:03:03.850> the

front to back back to front and then
that<00:03:09.370> middle<00:03:09.580> piece<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.880> just<00:03:10.060> sort<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.300> trade

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
that middle piece you just sort of trade

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.140 
that middle piece you just sort of trade
off<00:03:10.630> between<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:12.310> kind<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.760> just<00:03:12.790> an

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
off between it kind of is just an

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.820 
off between it kind of is just an
extension<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.989> just<00:03:14.140> sits<00:03:14.350> there<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.590> make

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
extension that just sits there and make

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.559 
extension that just sits there and make
sure<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.040> pull<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> really<00:03:15.489> tight<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:16.330> can<00:03:16.480> do

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
sure you pull it really tight you can do

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.970 
sure you pull it really tight you can do
a<00:03:16.600> looser<00:03:16.959> braid<00:03:17.080> it's<00:03:17.319> totally<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.799> you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
a looser braid it's totally up to you

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.960 
a looser braid it's totally up to you
and<00:03:18.070> how<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.220> want<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.519> do<00:03:18.670> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
so as you're seeing here the front is

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.740 
so as you're seeing here the front is
being<00:03:21.700> pulled<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.299> middle<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.690> that

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
being pulled to the middle and that

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.880 
being pulled to the middle and that
middle<00:03:22.989> piece<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.170> just<00:03:23.410> being<00:03:23.530> carried

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
middle piece is just being carried

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.160 
middle piece is just being carried
forward<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.579> that<00:03:25.150> back<00:03:25.360> piece<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:26.079> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
forward and that back piece to the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.470 
forward and that back piece to the
middle<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.489> middle<00:03:27.730> piece<00:03:27.910> which

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
middle and then the middle piece which

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.150 
middle and then the middle piece which
is<00:03:28.510> now<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.810> front<00:03:28.989> piece<00:03:29.260> backwards<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.100> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
is now the front piece backwards and the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.819 
is now the front piece backwards and the
middle<00:03:30.400> piece<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:30.730> kind<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:31.000> sits<00:03:31.239> there<00:03:31.480> and

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
middle piece just kind of sits there and

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.620 
middle piece just kind of sits there and
just<00:03:32.829> kind<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.160> acts<00:03:33.370> as<00:03:33.579> like<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.790> center<00:03:34.360> and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
just kind of acts as like a center and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.120 
just kind of acts as like a center and
you're<00:03:35.170> going<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.350> pull<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.530> front<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:35.980> back

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
you're going to pull the front and back

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.130 
you're going to pull the front and back
pieces<00:03:36.340> towards<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.450> middle<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:37.780> trade

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
pieces towards the middle and just trade

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.350 
pieces towards the middle and just trade
them<00:03:38.290> off<00:03:38.440> back<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.890> forth<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.299> of

them off back and forth and just kind of
as<00:03:40.600> you're<00:03:40.930> watching<00:03:41.290> me<00:03:41.410> do<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.739> hopefully

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
as you're watching me do this hopefully

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800 
as you're watching me do this hopefully
you're<00:03:42.370> learning<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.850> seeing<00:03:43.120> how<00:03:43.420> it's<00:03:43.600> done

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
you're learning and seeing how it's done

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.289 
you're learning and seeing how it's done
it's<00:03:44.049> really<00:03:44.320> something<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.370> have<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.549> do<00:03:45.940> and

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
it's really something you have to do and

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.539 
it's really something you have to do and
do<00:03:46.959> yourself<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.620> trial<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:47.950> error<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.340> sort

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
do yourself and trial and error and sort

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.550 
do yourself and trial and error and sort
of<00:03:48.609> get<00:03:48.790> used<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.239> doing<00:03:49.359> on<00:03:49.570> your<00:03:49.720> own<00:03:49.750> but

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
of get used to doing on your own but

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.140 
of get used to doing on your own but
this<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:50.890> basically<00:03:51.370> how<00:03:51.549> I'm<00:03:51.640> doing<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> with

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
this is basically how I'm doing it with

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.479 
this is basically how I'm doing it with
the<00:03:52.390> layers<00:03:52.769> as<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.920> can<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.160> there's<00:03:54.340> some

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
the layers as you can see there's some

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.520 
the layers as you can see there's some
poking<00:03:54.970> out<00:03:55.120> there<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:55.750> it's<00:03:56.140> kind<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.410> making

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
poking out there so it's kind of making

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.530 
poking out there so it's kind of making
it<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.769> little<00:03:56.799> melt<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.190> little<00:03:57.310> messy<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:57.790> maybe

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
it a little melt a little messy so maybe

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.509 
it a little melt a little messy so maybe
as<00:03:58.660> tight<00:03:58.900> as<00:03:59.109> you<00:03:59.140> want<00:03:59.650> or<00:03:59.980> as<00:04:00.100> loose<00:04:00.280> as<00:04:00.489> you

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
as tight as you want or as loose as you

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.090 
as tight as you want or as loose as you
want<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:01.450> layers<00:04:01.690> are<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.049> going<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.890> want

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
want the layers are just going to want

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.310 
want the layers are just going to want
to<00:04:03.160> make<00:04:04.120> them<00:04:04.299> as<00:04:04.420> tight<00:04:04.630> as<00:04:04.750> possible<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.230> I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
to make them as tight as possible and I

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.020 
to make them as tight as possible and I
find<00:04:05.530> that's<00:04:05.650> easiest<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.400> make<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.670> layers

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
find that's easiest to make the layers

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.810 
find that's easiest to make the layers
stick<00:04:07.989> into<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> braid<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.980> then<00:04:09.459> once

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
stick into the braid and then once

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.250 
stick into the braid and then once
you're<00:04:09.970> done<00:04:10.000> at<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.480> braid<00:04:10.720> as<00:04:10.930> long<00:04:11.079> as<00:04:11.170> your

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
you're done at the braid as long as your

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.020 
you're done at the braid as long as your
hair<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.579> want<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.790> take<00:04:12.940> that

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
hair is you can just want to take that

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.240 
hair is you can just want to take that
ponytail<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:13.859> attach<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.190> bottom

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
ponytail and attach it to the bottom

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.250 
ponytail and attach it to the bottom
so<00:04:16.730> because<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.000> have<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.390> layers<00:04:17.600> poking<00:04:18.170> out

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
so because I have the layers poking out

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.420 
so because I have the layers poking out
there<00:04:18.470> what<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.680> can<00:04:18.829> do<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.250> take

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
there what you can do is you can take

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.009 
there what you can do is you can take
some<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.790> bobby<00:04:19.940> pins<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.510> sort<00:04:20.989> of

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
some of the bobby pins and sort of

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.200 
some of the bobby pins and sort of
discreetly<00:04:21.560> put<00:04:21.709> them<00:04:21.890> in<00:04:22.040> behind<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.060> braid

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
discreetly put them in behind the braid

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.180 
discreetly put them in behind the braid
at<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.390> back<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:23.990> tuck<00:04:24.320> them<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:24.920> want

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
at the back and tuck them in if you want

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.920 
at the back and tuck them in if you want
to<00:04:25.370> but<00:04:25.910> I<00:04:25.970> find<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.330> easier<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.750> make<00:04:26.900> it

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to but I find it's easier to make it

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.540 
to but I find it's easier to make it
sort<00:04:27.140> of<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.290> Messier<00:04:27.710> braid<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.370> looks

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
sort of a Messier braid so it looks

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.490 
sort of a Messier braid so it looks
intentional<00:04:29.330> so<00:04:29.870> I'm<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.140> what<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.380> can

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
intentional so I'm just what you can

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.990 
intentional so I'm just what you can
what<00:04:30.890> you<00:04:30.920> can<00:04:31.130> do<00:04:31.250> like<00:04:31.400> I'm<00:04:31.550> doing<00:04:31.790> here<00:04:31.940> is

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
what you can do like I'm doing here is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.330 
what you can do like I'm doing here is
just<00:04:32.300> pull<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.780> braid<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.680> stretch<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.220> out<00:04:34.280> a

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
just pull the braid and stretch it out a

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.640 
just pull the braid and stretch it out a
bit<00:04:34.460> make<00:04:35.060> it<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.240> little<00:04:35.390> looser<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.110> sort<00:04:36.590> of

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
bit make it a little looser and sort of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.640 
bit make it a little looser and sort of
pull<00:04:37.070> them<00:04:37.250> apart<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:38.780> stud<00:04:39.080> will<00:04:39.350> pull<00:04:39.530> out

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
pull them apart this stud will pull out

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.040 
pull them apart this stud will pull out
some<00:04:39.920> more<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.700> layers<00:04:40.910> but<00:04:41.390> you<00:04:41.900> could

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
some more of the layers but you could

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.390 
some more of the layers but you could
like<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.200> said<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.470> can<00:04:42.590> use<00:04:42.620> bobby<00:04:42.920> pins<00:04:43.190> make

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
like I said you can use bobby pins make

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.710 
like I said you can use bobby pins make
or<00:04:43.580> discrete<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.060> straight<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.480> you<00:04:44.570> and

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
or discrete it straight like to you and

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.240 
or discrete it straight like to you and
how<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.810> want<00:04:45.170> and<00:04:45.440> what<00:04:45.830> kind<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.010> look<00:04:46.220> you

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
how you want and what kind of look you

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.690 
how you want and what kind of look you
want<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.610> achieve<00:04:46.730> with<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:48.310> now<00:04:49.310> because<00:04:49.550> I

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
want to achieve with it now because I

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.280 
want to achieve with it now because I
have<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:50.000> piece<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.480> hair<00:04:50.660> here<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:51.110> some

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
have this piece of hair here that some

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.440 
have this piece of hair here that some
layer<00:04:51.530> parts<00:04:52.280> that<00:04:52.520> did<00:04:52.670> not<00:04:52.820> fit<00:04:53.090> into<00:04:53.300> the

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
layer parts that did not fit into the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.360 
layer parts that did not fit into the
side<00:04:53.630> braid<00:04:53.870> because<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.500> wouldn't<00:04:55.040> pull<00:04:55.220> over

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
side braid because it wouldn't pull over

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.120 
side braid because it wouldn't pull over
I'm<00:04:55.700> taking<00:04:56.000> my<00:04:56.090> magic<00:04:56.420> bobby<00:04:56.600> pins<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.140> I'm

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
I'm taking my magic bobby pins and I'm

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.670 
I'm taking my magic bobby pins and I'm
pulling<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:59.090> hair<00:04:59.270> backwards<00:04:59.600> as<00:05:00.110> if<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.590> was

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
pulling the hair backwards as if it was

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.200 
pulling the hair backwards as if it was
part<00:05:00.920> of<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.130> braid<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.610> then<00:05:02.030> I'm<00:05:02.120> taking

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
part of the braid and then I'm taking

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.670 
part of the braid and then I'm taking
the<00:05:02.390> bobby<00:05:02.540> pin<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:02.810> just<00:05:03.020> tucking<00:05:03.260> it<00:05:03.500> into

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
the bobby pin and just tucking it into

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.470 
the bobby pin and just tucking it into
the<00:05:03.920> braids<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.820> fits<00:05:05.090> right<00:05:05.300> in

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
the braids so that it fits right in

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.810 
the braids so that it fits right in
there<00:05:05.660> as<00:05:05.780> if<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.110> was<00:05:06.260> not<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.530> problem<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.220> my

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
there as if it was not a problem and my

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.420 
there as if it was not a problem and my
hair<00:05:07.970> was<00:05:08.510> all<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.440> side<00:05:09.650> as<00:05:09.919> if<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.340> was

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
hair was all to the side as if it was

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.300 
hair was all to the side as if it was
waiting<00:05:10.550> on<00:05:10.669> one<00:05:10.820> layer<00:05:11.890> here<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:12.950> have<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.100> layer

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
waiting on one layer here I have a layer

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.710 
waiting on one layer here I have a layer
that<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.580> just<00:05:13.790> don't<00:05:13.940> like<00:05:14.060> sticking<00:05:14.390> out<00:05:14.600> it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
that I just don't like sticking out it

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.090 
that I just don't like sticking out it
looks<00:05:14.870> too<00:05:15.080> messy<00:05:15.410> so<00:05:15.470> I'm<00:05:15.620> just<00:05:15.740> taking<00:05:15.860> a

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
looks too messy so I'm just taking a

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.920 
looks too messy so I'm just taking a
bobby<00:05:16.280> pin<00:05:16.370> shoving<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.060> up<00:05:17.240> behind<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.720> braid

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
bobby pin shoving it up behind the braid

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.380 
bobby pin shoving it up behind the braid
so<00:05:18.200> it's<00:05:18.680> discreet<00:05:19.100> and<00:05:19.250> hidden<00:05:19.640> and<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.180> looks

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
so it's discreet and hidden and it looks

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.080 
so it's discreet and hidden and it looks
messy<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:20.990> still<00:05:21.500> kind<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.800> tidy<00:05:21.980> and<00:05:22.280> it

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
messy but still kind of tidy and it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.730 
messy but still kind of tidy and it
allows<00:05:23.540> you<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.780> have<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.020> nice<00:05:24.200> side<00:05:24.440> braid

allows you to have a nice side braid

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.040 
allows you to have a nice side braid
with<00:05:25.010> layered<00:05:25.370> hair<00:05:25.730> so<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.690> hope<00:05:26.840> you<00:05:26.900> guys
