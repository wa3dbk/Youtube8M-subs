00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 so here's the old swiss kracher 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:20.580
 Although is satan kh it because I 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.470
 later grad is in green and blasting 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.449
 with bks powder 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.840
 then we have the Swiss here 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.840
 cracker 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.710
 and asked this time with black powder 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.710
 It will look like that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.650
 here the swiss kracher with 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.490
 black powder 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.490
 let's see how that works 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.070
 so here the Swiss came with 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.460
 black powder the first one was 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 misfire 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.489
 and now weber says 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.570
 Super 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.229
 for comparison, an original 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.620
 swiss crusher with lightning bang 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.620
 sentence 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.399
 again the meadow 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 that was a clear difference 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.080
 here again afterwards the comparison with 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.210
 a channel is or the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.590
 light which assumes that there are new 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.590
 Swiss crackers with black powder 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.430
 and now to compare the age 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:52.860
 swiss kracher with pks the clear 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 is louder and of lightning still 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 stronger sensor so that's the old one 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.360
 so pretty now not large 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.720
 difference 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.450
 but the volume is the pressure 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.900
 the up is created and a lot bigger 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.849
 one on the video cute and microphone 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.730
 but it is a fact that the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.640
 old he is much better and that it 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.970
 not not do not come to it first of all 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.299
 It is sad that with the new ones 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.860
 the black powder from peter kunz 7 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.560
 swiss used only two 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.040
 ignited at the old student has almost 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.140
 everyone 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.160
 So it's not only expensive 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.590
 it has become quieter and you have more 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.250
 I would know misfiring end effect 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.290
 recommend 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.790
 to buy the new swiss kracher 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.790
 shame about the old ones
