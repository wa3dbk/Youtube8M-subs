generational challenges we were pushing

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.460 
generational challenges we were pushing
so<00:01:52.520> many<00:01:52.670> Polly's<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:54.020> know<00:01:54.110> we<00:01:54.200> had<00:01:54.319> high

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
so many Polly's and you know we had high

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.680 
so many Polly's and you know we had high
dynamic<00:01:54.679> range<00:01:54.920> lighting<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.569> know

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
dynamic range lighting and you know

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.199 
dynamic range lighting and you know
shadows<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:58.069> dynamic<00:01:58.640> weather<00:01:58.849> and<00:01:59.149> all

these<00:01:59.300> other<00:01:59.420> things<00:01:59.569> that<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:01.340> went<00:02:01.940> through

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
these other things that we went through

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.059 
these other things that we went through
this<00:02:02.209> process<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.780> build<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.140> level<00:02:03.440> really

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
this process of build a level really

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.279 
this process of build a level really
quickly<00:02:04.429> try<00:02:05.090> out<00:02:05.269> or<00:02:05.420> poor<00:02:05.629> assumptions<00:02:06.110> and

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
quickly try out or poor assumptions and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.680 
quickly try out or poor assumptions and
then<00:02:06.410> scrap<00:02:06.759> rebuilders<00:02:07.759> comfortably<00:02:08.479> build

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
then scrap rebuilders comfortably build

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.270 
then scrap rebuilders comfortably build
let's<00:02:08.840> grab<00:02:09.019> it<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.830> was<00:02:09.890> only<00:02:10.039> possible

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
let's grab it and that was only possible

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.860 
let's grab it and that was only possible
because<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:10.879> had<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.120> amazingly<00:02:11.660> flexible

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
because we had these amazingly flexible
