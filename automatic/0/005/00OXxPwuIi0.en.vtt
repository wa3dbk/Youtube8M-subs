year<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:49.080> know<00:05:49.199> I<00:05:49.259> believe<00:05:49.350> that<00:05:49.889> it's<00:05:50.340> the

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
but things aren't just perfect i think

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.850 
but things aren't just perfect i think
everyone<00:05:54.450> gives<00:05:54.810> up<00:05:55.020> a<00:05:55.140> little<00:05:55.380> easier<00:05:55.680> in<00:05:55.770> the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
everyone gives up a little easier in the

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.190 
everyone gives up a little easier in the
last<00:05:56.070> race<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:56.730> you<00:05:57.420> know<00:05:57.540> I<00:05:57.570> know<00:05:57.750> I<00:05:57.870> haven't
