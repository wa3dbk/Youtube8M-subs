00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 Hmm 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.549
 This 5 lip 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.270
 Kedomo also do it? Yes grip there very much 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:30.330
 High Bliss The'm made to start production from this month 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.330
 I know now I am not running yet of the city 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 I wonder if I got it 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.710
 Hey tax anywhere in the grade as Kedomo you can see no one that best island 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:05.300
 It sounds so I I had gotten into the and the smell of 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.720
 Harriered just nationwide 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.789
 Toka is a demand from people 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.080
 later 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.560
 Yeah it Is You wanted to ride in that Harrier 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.370
 Certainly Lexus is about one million by itself 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.370
 That's right, but it changes. 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.030
 Because 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.030
 There are many voices that want the successor of Harrier to appear 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:36.580
 It seems that when such a car snow is deep, it seems that it is strong. 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.220
 A little high for a Compared with the sedan 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.430
 Um, it's good to run such a place 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.560
 I would do it if I went to a real snowy mountain 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.610
 I will talk about it 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.590
 I usually run in the city and it is around here 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.819
 Once it was about say snow to rain 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.999
 Ummm 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:06.170
 Say riding tire is terminated, which originally attached 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:08.460
 Yes I think I have become studless as radial tire of either customary for the summer Yeah 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.540
 Well 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.870
 Dare to die in the winter the number You are also more 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.280
 But after all this is predatory stability 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.860
 Or the owner rim I heard in're wearing or bulls 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.100
 Well, if the height of the car is high, it 's probably the side wind 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.300
 5 more 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:33.530
 Cornering Yes I'm so is the feeling 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.070
 Wow underbody is quite firm in terms Harrier When I came out this time 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.070
 I see 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.600
 A place where you can enjoy having a little sporty run 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.600
 I agree 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.810
 I wondered if it was a basic sport part or a sedan 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.200
 Yes it's fresh 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.040
 That's right- 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.730
 To 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.630
 For example, from the previous Celica to a turn and no type at all 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.480
 It is from the pit lichen 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.680
 I When you go Toka Toka long-distance travel 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.440
 That absolutely specific stuck in a traffic jam Toka 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.780
 It says I stress of reservoir condition is 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:26.600
 It seems that it is still difficult to get the version with the big eyes high . 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.600
 Well Oh ahead a little, even enters the field of view 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.849
 It looks like a cheap light car pattern and high personality, but it looks like it looks like it is before you leave Japan 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.550
 Because there is no stress 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.210
 That pretty high 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.280
 It seems to be addicted 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.060
 Wind that say to you doing happened is certainly 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.060
 Hey there 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.159
 It seems that many were stuck in the house 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.980
 Sun Fram had a party at the night party 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:39.340
 4 I'm troubled, but this is an option, put the camera under the left and right door mirrors 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.650
 Wearing a camera 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.020
 Say so 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:49.560
 False road that 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.280
 It is the picture which is seen from the top of the left side . 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.020
 is not it 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.600
 I can do that, but I appeal to you this nice cm 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.490
 I'm sorry 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.540
 Yes wraps of their own 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.530
 that 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.790
 How does it move? If only Hankata is behind you 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.790
 To a 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:15.200
 Hey I see this is value ordering 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:21.410
 Video shot by four cameras 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:24.680
 I You're amazing produce, as seen from the launch Oh Watte on this pupa 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.710

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.480
 I Nainda accustomed his still 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.940
 Certainly this is everyone's scary 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.900
 It is absolutely necessary for the North Shiga Army 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.340
 I wonder if it will be time to put in a multistory parking lot or something 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.419
 But it is a little more 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.419
 I have not tried it 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.430
 Even the event has various functions 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.430
 Is I Teku It Well 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.180
