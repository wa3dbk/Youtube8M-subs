we took a full sheet watercolor paper
and<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.539> divided<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:22.109> into<00:00:22.320> five<00:00:22.680> inch<00:00:22.710> by<00:00:23.070> 7

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
and we divided up into five inch by 7

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
and we divided up into five inch by 7
inch<00:00:23.550> grids<00:00:24.090> these<00:00:24.750> are<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> be

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
inch grids these are all going to be

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
inch grids these are all going to be
tiny<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.160> paintings<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.000> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.510> to

so on a full sheet 22 by 30 inch
watercolor<00:00:33.660> paper<00:00:33.980> if<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.130> divide<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.820> into

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
watercolor paper if we divide it up into

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
watercolor paper if we divide it up into
five<00:00:36.660> inches<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.140> 7<00:00:37.500> inches<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.250> end<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:38.700> with

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
five inches by 7 inches you end up with

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.110 
five inches by 7 inches you end up with
18<00:00:39.710> possible<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:41.250> wonderful<00:00:41.550> paintings

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and this is what we used as warm-ups so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.380 
and this is what we used as warm-ups so
we<00:00:45.450> did<00:00:45.629> 30<00:00:45.930> seconds<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:47.460> paintings<00:00:48.090> using

only back and white and using the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
only back and white and using the
different<00:00:52.260> designs<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> great<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
different designs it was a great way to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
different designs it was a great way to
kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> jump<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.570> even<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.170> just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
kind of jump in even when you just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
kind of jump in even when you just
didn't<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.070> idea<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
didn't have an idea what to do so it's a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
didn't have an idea what to do so it's a
great<00:00:57.600> warm-up<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:59.000> choose<00:01:00.000> different

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
great warm-up to do choose different

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.229 
great warm-up to do choose different
compositions<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.859> work<00:01:02.370> very<00:01:02.969> fast

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
compositions and you just work very fast

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
compositions and you just work very fast
and<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.229> can't<00:01:04.710> slow<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.580> only

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and you can't slow down because you only

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.760 
and you can't slow down because you only
had<00:01:05.850> 30<00:01:06.060> seconds<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> let<00:01:07.080> me<00:01:07.170> show<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
had 30 seconds and let me show you the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.520 
had 30 seconds and let me show you the
chart<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> developed<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> chart

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
chart that I developed here is the chart

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
chart that I developed here is the chart
that<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.860> developed<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.400> me<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.840> it

are<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.509> representative<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.950> what<00:01:38.790> you're

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
are more representative of what you're

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.630 
are more representative of what you're
painting<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.840> still<00:01:40.439> works<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.860> me<00:01:41.009> twelve

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
painting it still works for me twelve

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
painting it still works for me twelve
different<00:01:41.880> designs<00:01:42.479> again<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.470> always<00:01:43.560> like

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
different designs again as I always like

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
different designs again as I always like
to<00:01:43.829> say<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> strong<00:01:45.119> structure<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to say if you have a strong structure a
