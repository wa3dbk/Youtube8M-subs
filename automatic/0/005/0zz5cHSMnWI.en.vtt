00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to help and we'll go ahead so basically

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
to help and we'll go ahead so basically
what<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> want<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.289> go

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
what you want to do is you want to go

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
what you want to do is you want to go
ahead<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.920> type<00:00:50.070> %<00:00:50.489> app<00:00:50.750> data<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.949> %

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
ahead and type % app data and then %

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
ahead and type % app data and then %
again<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:54.739> get

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
again and this will just basically get

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
again and this will just basically get
you<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.910> Minecraft<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> little

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you to Minecraft and if that's a little

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
you to Minecraft and if that's a little
too<00:00:59.609> complicated<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.410> ahead

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
too complicated for you you can go ahead

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.910 
too complicated for you you can go ahead
and<00:01:01.710> open<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.609> minecraft<00:01:03.090> options

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
launcher go over to options and where it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.410 
launcher go over to options and where it
says<00:01:07.170> game<00:01:07.710> location<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.310> disk<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> ahead

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
says game location on disk so go ahead

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
says game location on disk so go ahead
and<00:01:09.540> click<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.189> either<00:01:11.189> method<00:01:11.760> works

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and click on that either method works

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200 
and click on that either method works
and<00:01:12.930> either<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.030> same
