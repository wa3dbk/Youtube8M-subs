some<00:01:52.490> holes<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.030> because<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.840> needs<00:01:54.020> to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
some holes in it because it needs to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
Pollock I did dig a 12 inch hole you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.340 
Pollock I did dig a 12 inch hole you
want<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.770> fill<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:48.580> with<00:02:48.640> just<00:02:49.060> some<00:02:49.209> basic

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
want to fill it in with just some basic

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.690 
want to fill it in with just some basic
compost<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.560> use<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.890> course<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.250> organic

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
compost I use of course the organic

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.820 
compost I use of course the organic
compost<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:52.810> fill<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.230> with<00:02:53.350> some<00:02:53.470> compost

compost but fill it with some compost

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.890 
compost but fill it with some compost
and<00:02:54.100> mix<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.370> up<00:02:54.490> you're<00:02:55.450> going<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.750> be

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
and mix it up you're going to be

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.880 
and mix it up you're going to be
planting<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.100> horseradish<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.959> a<00:03:01.380> 45<00:03:02.380> degree

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
planting the horseradish in a 45 degree

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.310 
planting the horseradish in a 45 degree
angle<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.540> how<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.870> gonna<00:03:04.989> be<00:03:05.110> in

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
angle so this is how it's gonna be in

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.250 
angle so this is how it's gonna be in
the<00:03:05.440> soil<00:03:05.620> now<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.880> top<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.660> soil<00:03:07.840> should

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
the soil now the top of the soil should

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.060 
the soil now the top of the soil should
be<00:03:08.380> about<00:03:08.560> two<00:03:08.860> inches<00:03:09.250> above<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.239> crown<00:03:11.070> so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
be about two inches above the crown so

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.920 
be about two inches above the crown so
that<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.280> have<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.610> tapered<00:03:13.060> part<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
that you have the tapered part in the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.410 
that you have the tapered part in the
bottom<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.459> top<00:03:15.489> part<00:03:16.000> which<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.269> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
bottom and the top part which is a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.050 
bottom and the top part which is a
little<00:03:16.720> bit<00:03:16.780> wider<00:03:17.050> two<00:03:17.890> inches<00:03:18.280> from<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.850> top

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
little bit wider two inches from the top

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.729 
little bit wider two inches from the top
and<00:03:19.299> then<00:03:19.720> you're<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:19.989> gonna<00:03:20.110> cover<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.680> up

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
and then you're just gonna cover that up

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.310 
and then you're just gonna cover that up
with<00:03:20.890> mulch<00:03:21.340> now<00:03:22.000> mulch<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.450> great<00:03:22.720> because<00:03:23.110> it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
with mulch now mulch is great because it

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.240 
with mulch now mulch is great because it
helps<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.769> protect<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:26.590> root<00:03:26.830> from

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
helps to protect the the root from

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.789 
helps to protect the the root from
drying<00:03:27.580> out<00:03:27.820> if<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.660> very<00:03:28.930> dry<00:03:29.170> season

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
drying out if you have a very dry season

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.770 
drying out if you have a very dry season
you<00:03:30.370> want<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.700> conserve<00:03:31.060> your<00:03:31.239> moisture<00:03:31.660> in

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you want to conserve your moisture in

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.229 
you want to conserve your moisture in
the<00:03:31.870> soil<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.040> mulch<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.400> gray<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.820> use<00:03:33.970> pine

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the soil so the mulch is gray I use pine

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.140 
the soil so the mulch is gray I use pine
straw<00:03:34.540> myself<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:36.040> we<00:03:36.160> have<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.340> very<00:03:36.610> long<00:03:36.850> dry

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
straw myself but we have a very long dry

straw myself but we have a very long dry
season<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.660> then<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.110> very<00:03:38.380> wet

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.330 
season and then we have a very wet
season<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.269> do<00:03:40.540> use<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.110> pine<00:03:41.709> straw<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.070> I

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
season so I do use the pine straw and I

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.710 
season so I do use the pine straw and I
don't<00:03:42.820> know<00:03:42.880> if<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.030> can<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.390> any<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.660> these

actually<00:03:56.200> start<00:03:56.650> seeing<00:03:56.920> some<00:03:57.310> sprouts<00:03:57.700> if

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
actually start seeing some sprouts if

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.120 
actually start seeing some sprouts if
