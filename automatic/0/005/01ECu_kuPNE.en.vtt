actual aesthetic of the shipyard it's

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.199 
actual aesthetic of the shipyard it's
very<00:02:46.140> nice<00:02:46.380> indeed<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.489> wee<00:02:47.880> bit<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.090> a

ships could no doubt be and one which
I've<00:03:13.320> already<00:03:13.790> constructed<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.480> how<00:03:15.780> did<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.110> go

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
I've already constructed so how did I go

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.520 
I've already constructed so how did I go
about<00:03:16.650> making<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.910> ship<00:03:18.239> well<00:03:19.140> when<00:03:19.380> your

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
gonna provide you with a blueprint for a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.500 
gonna provide you with a blueprint for a
transport<00:03:45.420> ship<00:03:45.600> free<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.829> charge<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.329> is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
transport ship free of charge so this is

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.390 
transport ship free of charge so this is
to<00:03:48.630> get<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.049> started<00:03:49.709> with<00:03:49.890> your<00:03:50.100> ship

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
to get you started with your ship

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.750 
to get you started with your ship
constructions<00:03:51.269> but<00:03:51.930> other<00:03:52.320> than<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.040> you're

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
constructions but other than that you're

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.030 
constructions but other than that you're
back<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.299> your<00:03:54.360> own<00:03:54.810> again<00:03:55.019> because<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.739> next

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
back on your own again because the next

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.789 
back on your own again because the next
mission<00:03:56.340> will<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:57.120> actually<00:03:57.329> create<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
mission will be to actually create the

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.650 
mission will be to actually create the
transport<00:03:59.489> ship<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.540> requires<00:04:02.660> 1,000

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
transport ship and that requires 1,000

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
to go out and start to farm some so once

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.310
