you<00:04:51.940> internationally<00:04:52.630> again<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.200> is

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
you internationally again this is

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.290 
you internationally again this is
probably<00:04:53.740> most<00:04:54.250> going<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.670> benefit<00:04:55.060> our

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
probably most going to benefit our

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.690 
probably most going to benefit our
Canadian<00:04:55.870> customers<00:04:56.490> because<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:57.640> just

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
Canadian customers because it's just

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.660 
Canadian customers because it's just
less<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.330> ship<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:58.750> them<00:04:59.190> it's<00:05:00.190> not<00:05:00.280> as<00:05:00.430> far

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
less to ship to them it's not as far

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.700 
less to ship to them it's not as far
closer<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.570> us<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.080> going<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.260> be<00:05:02.320> less<00:05:02.530> to

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
closer to us so it's going to be less to

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.470 
closer to us so it's going to be less to
ship<00:05:02.920> anything<00:05:03.670> that<00:05:03.940> has<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.150> go<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.270> an

airplane or further ways of course going

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.640 
airplane or further ways of course going
to<00:05:06.250> be<00:05:06.340> more<00:05:06.520> expensive<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:07.560> keep<00:05:08.560> your
