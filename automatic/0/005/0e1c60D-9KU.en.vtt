the next turn now looking at this here

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.250 
the next turn now looking at this here
again<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:13.850> see<00:03:14.060> once<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.050> lip

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
let's watch those arms you lips are nice

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.930 
let's watch those arms you lips are nice
and<00:03:32.840> high<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.680> you'll<00:03:33.800> see<00:03:33.980> taxis<00:03:34.310> other<00:03:34.670> arm

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
and high and you'll see taxis other arm

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.640 
and high and you'll see taxis other arm
in<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.300> make<00:03:35.450> sure<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:35.810> not<00:03:35.930> pointing<00:03:36.470> down

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
in to make sure it's not pointing down

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.590 
in to make sure it's not pointing down
towards<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.310> water<00:03:37.490> for<00:03:37.730> too<00:03:37.910> long<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.540> that

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
towards the water for too long and that

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.900 
towards the water for too long and that
really<00:03:39.260> helps<00:03:39.740> him<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.040> stay<00:03:40.250> unweighted

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
really helps him to stay unweighted

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.760 
really helps him to stay unweighted
until<00:03:41.240> he<00:03:41.300> lands<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.720> maneuver<00:03:42.140> he<00:03:42.350> doesn't

until he lands the maneuver he doesn't

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.350 
until he lands the maneuver he doesn't
want<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.980> land<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.340> hard<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.210> can

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
want to land it hard and then you can

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.950 
want to land it hard and then you can
set<00:03:44.540> up<00:03:44.570> for<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.870> next<00:03:45.140> turn<00:03:46.510> going<00:03:47.510> into<00:03:47.810> this

set up for the next turn going into this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.810 
set up for the next turn going into this
air<00:03:48.260> you'll<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:49.070> not<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.610> perfect

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
air you'll see this is not the perfect

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.660 
air you'll see this is not the perfect
air<00:03:50.330> but<00:03:50.960> he<00:03:51.050> still<00:03:51.290> answered<00:03:51.830> both<00:03:52.070> feet<00:03:52.400> come

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
air but he still answered both feet come

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.210 
air but he still answered both feet come
off<00:03:52.700> he<00:03:53.150> slides<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.960> board<00:03:54.260> his<00:03:54.890> arms

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
off he slides up the board his arms

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280 
off he slides up the board his arms
pointing<00:03:55.670> down<00:03:55.880> but<00:03:56.570> because<00:03:56.900> he<00:03:56.990> managed<00:03:57.230> to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
pointing down but because he managed to

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.780 
pointing down but because he managed to
keep<00:03:57.530> nice<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:57.800> light<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.190> he's<00:03:58.550> done<00:03:58.760> a

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
keep nice and light and he's done a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.700 
keep nice and light and he's done a
hundred<00:03:59.060> or<00:03:59.330> more<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.630> these<00:03:59.810> probably<00:04:00.590> in

this<00:04:00.860> session<00:04:01.130> already<00:04:01.430> he<00:04:02.150> managed<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.630> land

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
this session already he managed to land

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.990 
this session already he managed to land
it<00:04:03.020> will<00:04:03.260> ease<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:04.070> doesn't<00:04:04.520> have<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.880> be

probably about 30 or 40 degrees you then

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.360 
probably about 30 or 40 degrees you then

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
right spot let's watch this error verse

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.730 
right spot let's watch this error verse
watch<00:04:51.070> his<00:04:51.280> upper<00:04:51.610> body<00:04:51.790> he's<00:04:52.750> really<00:04:53.470> pushed

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
watch his upper body he's really pushed

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.560 
watch his upper body he's really pushed
this<00:04:53.920> one<00:04:54.190> but<00:04:54.550> he's<00:04:54.670> kept<00:04:54.940> his<00:04:55.030> upper<00:04:55.390> body

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
this one but he's kept his upper body

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.810 
this one but he's kept his upper body
nice<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:55.870> relaxed<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.340> when<00:04:57.460> he<00:04:57.550> lands

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
nice and relaxed so that when he lands

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.970 
nice and relaxed so that when he lands
even<00:04:58.270> though<00:04:58.360> he<00:04:58.450> hasn't<00:04:58.630> gone<00:04:58.840> 180<00:04:59.170> you<00:04:59.770> can

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
even though he hasn't gone 180 you can

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.310 
even though he hasn't gone 180 you can
push<00:05:00.250> his<00:05:00.460> feet<00:05:00.760> around<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.450> make<00:05:01.930> sure<00:05:01.960> the

push his feet around and make sure the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.740 
push his feet around and make sure the
board<00:05:02.560> completes<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.400> error<00:05:03.580> verse<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.600> that

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
board completes the error verse so that

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.390 
board completes the error verse so that
he<00:05:04.870> can<00:05:05.080> land<00:05:05.260> with<00:05:05.530> ease<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:05.890> set<00:05:06.100> up<00:05:06.190> for<00:05:06.340> the

he can land with ease and set up for the

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.950 
he can land with ease and set up for the
next<00:05:06.640> one<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:09.610> three<00:05:09.910> most<00:05:10.120> common<00:05:10.300> mistakes

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
next one the three most common mistakes

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.320 
next one the three most common mistakes
with<00:05:11.200> aerials<00:05:11.740> are<00:05:12.040> number<00:05:12.730> one<00:05:12.940> hitting<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
with aerials are number one hitting the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.850 
with aerials are number one hitting the
look<00:05:13.450> too<00:05:13.660> early<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.620> don't

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
look too early so that you don't

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.380 
look too early so that you don't
actually<00:05:15.010> get<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.580> air<00:05:15.820> although<00:05:16.180> your

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
actually get in the air although your

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.940 
actually get in the air although your
body<00:05:16.690> does<00:05:16.930> some<00:05:17.140> funny<00:05:17.380> thing<00:05:17.620> like<00:05:17.770> you're

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
body does some funny thing like you're

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.030 
body does some funny thing like you're
going<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.340> number<00:05:19.240> two<00:05:19.540> it's<00:05:19.930> landing<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.010> a

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
going to number two it's landing the a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.040 
going to number two it's landing the a
on<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.400> back<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.910> way<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:22.600> forgetting

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
on the back of the way so forgetting

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.510 
on the back of the way so forgetting
that<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.290> wave<00:05:23.440> is<00:05:23.620> moving<00:05:23.800> forwards<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.400> the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
that the wave is moving forwards to the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.040 
that the wave is moving forwards to the
beach<00:05:24.730> you<00:05:25.180> have<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.450> make<00:05:25.600> sure<00:05:25.630> you

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
beach you have to make sure you

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.080 
beach you have to make sure you
projected<00:05:26.590> forwards<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.580> third<00:05:27.850> mistake

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
projected forwards and the third mistake

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.290 
projected forwards and the third mistake
is<00:05:28.919> straightening<00:05:29.919> your<00:05:30.040> legs<00:05:30.340> too<00:05:30.580> much<00:05:30.760> so

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
is straightening your legs too much so
