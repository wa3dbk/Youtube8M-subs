00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.970
 then it is also a big lead court 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.340
 it is unfortunately often to drink pear in their hands 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.700
 and you know that our oligarchs 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.670

 oligarch 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.780
 Yes, and it is not only such cases can 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.110
 happen at times 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.910
 therefore guarantees that 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.910
 this money will always go

 then you can meet another girl 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.520
 and then do not forget that the woman is not 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.680

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.370

 nevertheless this trend 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 but I will not be told everyone now this idea they

 we always have a desire 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.010

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.290

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:27.380
 great success 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.529
 for a year and a half 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.619

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.499
 eurobonds she stayed 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.359
 in shanghai 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.289
 she wants to start something else she can't 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.529
 even uses her own name 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.390
 because she thinks it is 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.259
 connected with her success 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.099
 and this is an example of the most successful nasharka 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.549

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.969
 moreover, they even opened two boutiques in

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.539
 you write about how Russians did fashion 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.109
 would give a percentage would run well maybe 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.019
 to be not all munirs we gave the children names 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.839
 almost that is almost all problems 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.609
 the world is true 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.829

 we can tell you a new circle 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.140

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.789
 we are grateful about 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:54.459
 do you know that from crossing two 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.069
 potato awards news 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.129
 you know what happens in the world a lot 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.609
 dog breeds 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.710
 but then mother enceladus dachshunds 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.580
 there is a way in this option or it happens 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.150
 German Shepherd Dogs and when the article is not 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.380

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.519
 toksovo they were not watered 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.480
 Pooch Astana agree I am glad that his 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.900
 According to quotas, how should he himself 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.539
 concerns our designers 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.349
 talented people 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.969
 they cover some idea many know how 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.699
 draw many 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:26.919
 not bad oriented 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:27.610

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.240
 can watch rbk 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.779
 goal balance 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:33.680
 historical and cultural 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.920
 tours through which passed 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.849
 generations of Europeans 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.270
 whose mothers and grandmothers and great-grandmothers 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.450
 survived water first hand 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.559
 they don't have 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.119
 they have nowhere to take therefore often not 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.919
 I think that they invent 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.529
 inventing anything why so often they 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:52.910
 still in the past 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.300
 because it is new to them 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 and they sometimes want 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.759
 conquer laughter so that the world already has what it is 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.340
 was conquered for example they get us 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.600
 1923 models because them 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.759
 saw in a magazine or a book in a grave in 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:09.330
 alien 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.780
 This is how it does not show time for now. 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.520
 he 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.960
 Khokhloma educational 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.129
 lame horse of Tyumen 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.370
 it was already done in 1922 at the house of risk 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.729
 but they don't know it 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.409
 Europe especially in the fashion world has 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.430
 collective collective memory 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.389
 from the fashion museum we still have no country 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.300
 have archives year we still are not injured 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.780
 we don't even have a library 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.460
 art library but there too 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.569
 there are bottles of fashion magazines because we 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.020
 lived behind the iron curtain 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.980
 no period represented 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.330
 ok because we didn't get it 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.059
 magazines 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:47.080
 this period 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.189
 in this way 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.229
 still a lot to do and one 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.399
 Vasiliev is not enough but 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.839
 said want to do 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.589
 I always want to open a fashion museum 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.429
 and it never gets the answer to them 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:01.679
 support as sometimes aziz support 

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.089
 mister 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.039
 percent there is support i'm better 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.669
 I will tell mister Yudashkin 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.300
 and lord of the meadows 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.330
 good lord of the meadows 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
 promised mister david what would 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.240
 paper that he will open the municipal we with 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.969
 him he 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.719
 and that supposedly he will be a huge 20 thousand 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:21.250
 meters 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.930
 that he will be somewhere in 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.430
 the center of Moscow obviously we 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.060
 cultural space can 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.540
 to be with the shopping gallery of a new place 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.560
 for europe 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.029
 but the situation is hard for me to say 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:35.259
 however, plans remained until not realize 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:37.779
 ca news kz real estate can talk 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.939
 but I'll tell you something else 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.289
 I believe that the museums of Berlin read 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:43.099
 collections 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:44.539
 they are from the act 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:46.669
 you first need to collect it 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.350
 how bakhrushin collected and then opened 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.069
 Tretyakov collected well and then did 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.020
 the saint collected then opened the rosy 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.819
 gathered then opened Catherine the Great 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:58.629
 gathered then opened hermitage 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.539
 no need to start with a piece of paper 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.119
 you must first start with collecting and 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:04.309
 set main directions 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.379
 collecting conservation 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.740
 restoration of exposure 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.810
 educational cycle as a structure 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.610
 iconic is ready and you are ready for your colleague 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.949
 energy ethnics cancel cancel talk about 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.490

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.970
 permanently lasting 40th anniversary i 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.940
 here the main thing is to think that we must imagine 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.060
 exposition from the historical museum 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.149
 You don't know 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:28.659
 and they have many thousands of costumes due 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:31.659
 which hunt vault 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:33.759
 department d 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.480
 they are textile suit 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.470
 and instead of presenting them they are not 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.730
 showed and they are worthy but they supposedly 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.640
 does not represent historical 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.590
 values â€‹â€‹next to the players next to 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.590
 red square 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.660
 hence even unfortunately forced 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.659
 break off 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:50.239
 music and everything to listen in real 

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:52.929
 having served a new group of milk I adore 

00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:54.069
 milk
