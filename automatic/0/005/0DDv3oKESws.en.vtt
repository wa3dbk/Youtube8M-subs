that we are focused so exclusively on

that we are focused so exclusively on
these<00:00:24.150> huge<00:00:24.539> deficits<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> debt<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
these huge deficits and debt that one of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
these huge deficits and debt that one of
the<00:00:27.779> main<00:00:28.230> means<00:00:28.529> by<00:00:28.800> which<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.580> of

the main means by which we get out of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
the main means by which we get out of
the<00:00:29.849> mess<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.599> grow<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.560> grow

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the mess is to grow and if we don't grow

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.340 
the mess is to grow and if we don't grow
our<00:00:32.279> economy<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.840> no<00:00:34.020> amount<00:00:34.230> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
our economy then there's no amount of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
our economy then there's no amount of
cutting<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.829> will<00:00:34.980> solve<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.370> problem<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
cutting that will solve this problem so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.569 
cutting that will solve this problem so
I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> party<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.860> should<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:38.190> offering

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I think as a party we should be offering

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880 
I think as a party we should be offering
solutions<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.300> creates<00:00:39.890> sustained

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
solutions that creates sustained

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799

economic<00:00:41.309> growth<00:00:41.640> over<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.149> long<00:00:42.360> haul<00:00:42.420> that

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
the old ones but the ones that will be

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
the old ones but the ones that will be
in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> forefront<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> next<00:01:26.939> ten

in the forefront now and in the next ten

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.960 
in the forefront now and in the next ten
years<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.590> should<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> time<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
years so this should be a time of a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.450 
years so this should be a time of a
renaissance<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.079> policymaking<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.280> hope

renaissance in policymaking and I hope

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
renaissance in policymaking and I hope

a candidate that gets beyond attacking

a candidate that gets beyond attacking
the<00:02:18.270> president<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.900> mean<00:02:19.110> that's<00:02:19.200> low<00:02:19.410> hanging

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the president I mean that's low hanging

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.650 
the president I mean that's low hanging
fruit<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.550> president's<00:02:21.030> policies<00:02:21.480> have

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
fruit the president's policies have

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.809 
fruit the president's policies have
failed<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.500> sometimes<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.250> overdo

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
failed and sometimes I think we overdo

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.720 
failed and sometimes I think we overdo
the<00:02:24.209> attacks<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.440> almost<00:02:25.800> become<00:02:26.190> personal

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the attacks that almost become personal

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.339 
the attacks that almost become personal
and<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.060> think<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.330> focus<00:02:27.540> ought<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.959> be<00:02:28.110> on

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and I think the focus ought to be on

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.160 
and I think the focus ought to be on
offering<00:02:29.069> compelling<00:02:29.760> alternatives<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
offering compelling alternatives so I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.620 
offering compelling alternatives so I
want<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.470> truth<00:02:31.680> teller<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:33.120> want<00:02:33.300> someone

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
want a truth teller and I want someone

want a truth teller and I want someone
who's<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.500> courage<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.280> their

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
who's going to have the courage of their

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.030 
who's going to have the courage of their
convictions<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:36.120> advocate<00:02:36.840> boulder<00:02:37.500> policy

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
convictions to advocate boulder policy

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.350 
convictions to advocate boulder policy
to<00:02:38.190> make<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.459> election<00:02:38.910> about<00:02:39.090> big<00:02:39.330> things

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
to make this election about big things

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.650 
to make this election about big things

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
rather than small things and I think the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.150 
rather than small things and I think the
other<00:02:42.780> element<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.010> have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
other element of this is that they have

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.830 
other element of this is that they have
to<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> character<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.150> withstand<00:02:45.390> what

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
to have the character to withstand what

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.530 
to have the character to withstand what
will<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.110> enormous<00:02:46.560> attacks<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.420> going

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
will be enormous attacks this is going

in the field right now that meet those
qualifications<00:03:10.250> some<00:03:11.250> are<00:03:11.400> doing<00:03:11.640> better

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
qualifications some are doing better

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.640 
qualifications some are doing better
than<00:03:12.060> others<00:03:12.390> because<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> kind<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
than others because of the kind of the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.890 
than others because of the kind of the
ebb<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:13.860> flow<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:15.150> moment<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:15.630> over<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
ebb and flow of the moment but over the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.050 
ebb and flow of the moment but over the
long<00:03:16.049> haul<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> crazy<00:03:17.190> process<00:03:17.579> but<00:03:17.970> it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
long haul this is a crazy process but it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.569 
long haul this is a crazy process but it
does<00:03:18.209> seem<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.799> bring<00:03:19.799> out<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.010> best<00:03:20.340> in

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
does seem to bring out the best in

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.460 
does seem to bring out the best in
candidates<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.390> they<00:03:21.720> meet<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.079> challenge

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
candidates and they meet the challenge

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.990 
candidates and they meet the challenge
and<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.769> my<00:03:22.920> guess<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.130> we'll<00:03:23.519> have<00:03:23.700> two<00:03:23.850> or

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
and so my guess is we'll have two or

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060 
and so my guess is we'll have two or
three<00:03:24.030> candidates<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.930> could<00:03:25.680> beat<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
three candidates that could beat the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.449 
three candidates that could beat the
President<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.730> will<00:03:27.720> be<00:03:27.900> very<00:03:28.410> viable<00:03:28.739> next

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
President and will be very viable next

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.830 
President and will be very viable next
year<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.880> president's<00:03:30.239> got<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> tough

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
year the president's got to have a tough

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.410 
year the president's got to have a tough
time<00:03:30.900> with<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.859> failed<00:03:32.850> economic<00:03:33.090> policies

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
time with the failed economic policies

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.599 
time with the failed economic policies

it matters I don't know if endorsements
matter<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.739> hugely<00:03:44.130> important

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
private sector certainly and it was it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.729 
private sector certainly and it was it
was<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.920> good<00:03:56.190> governor<00:03:56.370> as<00:03:56.700> well<00:03:57.440> Jon<00:03:58.440> Huntsman

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
was a good governor as well Jon Huntsman

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.380 
was a good governor as well Jon Huntsman
I<00:03:59.220> mean<00:03:59.340> these<00:03:59.430> are<00:03:59.609> candidates<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.269> a

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
I mean these are candidates that have a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.770 
I mean these are candidates that have a
lot<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.750> offer<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:02.040> my<00:04:02.220> guess<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.780> you

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
lot to offer and my guess is that you

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.990 
lot to offer and my guess is that you
know<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:04.049> probably<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.920> given<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.819> nature

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
know I'm probably just given the nature

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.370 
know I'm probably just given the nature
of<00:04:06.150> how<00:04:06.390> important<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.079> might<00:04:07.260> get

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
of how important this is I might get

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.830 
of how important this is I might get
involved<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.430> any<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.150> these<00:04:09.359> candidates

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
involved but any of these candidates

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.330

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
diverse state so you can't really narrow

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
be a bigger broader message I think

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.840 
be a bigger broader message I think

and one foot planted in the Americas so

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.870 
and one foot planted in the Americas so
having<00:05:14.590> some<00:05:14.980> sensitivity<00:05:15.790> and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
having some sensitivity and

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.030 
having some sensitivity and
understanding<00:05:16.570> of<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.320> connectivity<00:05:18.010> of

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
understanding of the connectivity of

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.880 
understanding of the connectivity of
Florida<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:19.630> region<00:05:20.290> in<00:05:20.410> which<00:05:20.440> we

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
Florida and the region in which we

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.070 
Florida and the region in which we
operate<00:05:21.220> I<00:05:21.670> think<00:05:22.000> would<00:05:22.150> be<00:05:22.270> important<00:05:22.750> we

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
operate I think would be important we

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.420 
operate I think would be important we
have<00:05:23.170> some<00:05:23.290> unique<00:05:23.440> environmental<00:05:24.010> issues

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
have some unique environmental issues

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.030 
have some unique environmental issues
that<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.360> think<00:05:26.080> are<00:05:26.410> important<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.950> be

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
that I think are important to be

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.130 
that I think are important to be
sensitive<00:05:27.490> we're<00:05:27.790> this<00:05:28.420> is<00:05:28.570> an<00:05:28.690> incredible

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
sensitive we're this is an incredible

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.230 
sensitive we're this is an incredible
ecosystem<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.010> Republicans<00:05:30.820> don't<00:05:30.940> normally

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
ecosystem and Republicans don't normally

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.270 
ecosystem and Republicans don't normally
talk<00:05:31.420> about<00:05:31.860> conservation<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.250> the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
talk about conservation and the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.130 
talk about conservation and the
environment<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:33.940> I<00:05:34.030> think<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.360> plays<00:05:34.900> well

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
environment but I think it plays well

environment but I think it plays well
down<00:05:35.380> here<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.740> do<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.400> of<00:05:37.000> course

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
down here to do that and of course

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.480 
down here to do that and of course
