welcome to the diello store this
training<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.600> about<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.110> RI<00:00:04.380> function<00:00:10.700> what

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
training is about the RI function what

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.690 
training is about the RI function what
is<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.090> RI<00:00:12.330> function<00:00:13.110> our<00:00:13.679> eyes<00:00:13.950> means<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
is the RI function our eyes means the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.750 
is the RI function our eyes means the
reference<00:00:14.940> index<00:00:15.770> it<00:00:16.770> allows<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.340> find<00:00:17.609> by

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
reference index it allows you to find by

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.990 
reference index it allows you to find by
the<00:00:17.789> path<00:00:18.180> datum<00:00:18.690> or<00:00:18.840> what<00:00:19.320> 0<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.279> case<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the path datum or what 0 in case of a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.929 
the path datum or what 0 in case of a
power<00:00:21.180> failure<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> jobs<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.789> to

power failure or if the jobs need to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.089 
power failure or if the jobs need to
takes<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> few<00:00:24.480> days<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.050> finish<00:00:27.949> remember<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
takes a few days to finish remember to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.930 
takes a few days to finish remember to
set<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.369> path<00:00:29.880> 0<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.630> absolute<00:00:31.349> mode<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
set your path 0 in absolute mode and

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.600 
set your path 0 in absolute mode and
when<00:00:32.940> needed<00:00:33.270> 5<00:00:33.870> by<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> park<00:00:34.380> 0<00:00:34.649> using<00:00:35.370> our<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
when needed 5 by the park 0 using our I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.830 
when needed 5 by the park 0 using our I
function<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.660> first<00:00:40.200> set<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.840> Dro

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
function you need to first set the Dro

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.990 
function you need to first set the Dro
to<00:00:43.440> absolute<00:00:43.980> mode<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.539> set<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.719> path<00:00:45.960> 0<00:00:48.620> ok

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
to absolute mode and set your path 0 ok

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
to absolute mode and set your path 0 ok
so<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> case<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.559> say<00:00:52.680> our<00:00:52.920> path<00:00:53.160> 0<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so in this case let's say our path 0 is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.639 
so in this case let's say our path 0 is
on<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.660> location<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.420> move<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:58.500> scale

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
on this location and we move our scale

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.570 
on this location and we move our scale
that's<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.829> rate<00:01:02.070> under<00:01:03.140> read<00:01:04.140> ahead<00:01:04.460> we<00:01:05.460> are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that's a rate under read ahead we are

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's a rate under read ahead we are
now<00:01:05.850> aligned<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.960> B<00:01:07.560> position<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.840> we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
now aligned to the B position so now we

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.070 
now aligned to the B position so now we
are<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.590> absolute<00:01:11.460> mode<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
are in absolute mode if it's in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.749 
are in absolute mode if it's in
incremental<00:01:13.920> mode<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.939> hunger<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.740> ABS

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
incremental mode just hunger the ABS

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.060 
incremental mode just hunger the ABS
increment<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> button<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.770> get<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
increment the button and get it to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.570 
increment the button and get it to
absolute<00:01:20.490> mode<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.020> now<00:01:22.020> we'll<00:01:22.259> set<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.009> 0

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.289 

okay<00:01:27.770> now<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.829> completed<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> first<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:29.909> step

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
okay now we completed the first two step

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.399 
okay now we completed the first two step
so<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.710> any<00:01:31.979> case<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.579> power<00:01:32.820> failure<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.509> we

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so in any case of power failure or we

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.630 
so in any case of power failure or we
want<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> walk<00:01:34.860> another<00:01:35.220> day

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
want to walk another day

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.880 
want to walk another day
we<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.900> need<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.200> fight<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.570> our<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
we just need to fight back the our I

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
we just need to fight back the our I
using<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.009> time<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.750> moving<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
using this time so now we are moving the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.550 
using this time so now we are moving the
esses<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.149> let's<00:01:48.149> say<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> power

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
esses and let's say there's a power

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.940 
esses and let's say there's a power
failure<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:52.790> we<00:01:53.790> still<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.119> still<00:01:54.420> moving

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
failure and we still are still moving

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.170 
failure and we still are still moving
the<00:01:55.950> SS<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:59.399> now<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.640> lost<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.780> turmoil<00:02:01.320> d

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
the SS so now we lost all the turmoil d

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.779 
the SS so now we lost all the turmoil d
let's<00:02:03.180> power<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.630> again<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.759> back

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
let's power on again now if we go back

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.490 
let's power on again now if we go back
to<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.480 

they<00:02:12.040> tell<00:02:12.310> me<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:13.980> align<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> right

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
they tell me to align with the right

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.290 
they tell me to align with the right
point<00:02:17.400> okay<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.720> position<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.590> lost

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
point okay the position is lost

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.780 
point okay the position is lost
let's<00:02:22.300> go<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> each<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.730> case

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
let's go to each one and so in this case

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.780 
let's go to each one and so in this case
we<00:02:28.209> need<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> recover<00:02:29.050> back<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.790> reference

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
we need to recover back the reference

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.310 
we need to recover back the reference
position<00:02:31.000> using<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.080> RI<00:02:32.410> function<00:02:34.020> press<00:02:35.020> on

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
position using the RI function press on

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.900 
position using the RI function press on
the<00:02:35.530> RI<00:02:35.770> function<00:02:37.890> choose<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.160> SS<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the RI function choose the SS that you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.840 
the RI function choose the SS that you
won<00:02:41.340> excesses<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.440> keep<00:02:44.440> moving<00:02:44.890> your<00:02:45.459> give

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
won excesses and keep moving your give

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.470 
won excesses and keep moving your give
me<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> skill<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:47.320> will<00:02:47.440> continue<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.160> bling

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
me a skill you will continue to bling

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.300 
me a skill you will continue to bling
until<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.750> has<00:02:50.050> found<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.310> reference<00:02:52.209> index

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
until it has found the reference index

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
until it has found the reference index
the<00:02:54.310> reference<00:02:54.790> index<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.390> normally<00:02:56.230> located

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
the reference index is normally located

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.460 
the reference index is normally located
in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.370> center<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.880> scale<00:02:58.239> with<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.230> red

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
in the center of the scale with a red

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.800 
in the center of the scale with a red

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.430 
dot and B 3 dot is the sensor light and
when<00:03:08.080> we<00:03:08.200> reach<00:03:08.940> there's<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.000> peep<00:03:10.270> sound<00:03:10.570> and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
when we reach there's a peep sound and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.670 
when we reach there's a peep sound and
he<00:03:12.220> has<00:03:12.370> found<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.709> path<00:03:14.709> 0<00:03:15.870> okay<00:03:16.870> now<00:03:17.350> if<00:03:17.530> we

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
he has found the path 0 okay now if we

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:31.030 
he has found the path 0 okay now if we
