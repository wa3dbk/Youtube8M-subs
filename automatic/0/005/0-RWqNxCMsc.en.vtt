you<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.110> let's<00:00:37.649> say<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.040> example<00:00:38.520> you're

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670

who's<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.950> closest<00:00:41.489> expansion<00:00:42.059> into<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
who's going closest expansion into a

who's going closest expansion into a
third<00:00:42.629> base<00:00:43.760> probably<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
third base probably not really going to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
third base probably not really going to
work<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> foremost<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:47.250> order<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
work so first and foremost in order to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
work so first and foremost in order to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
execute this build order properly you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
execute this build order properly you
will<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:49.920> pretty<00:00:50.219> damn<00:00:50.399> good<00:00:50.610> at

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
will need to be pretty damn good at

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
will need to be pretty damn good at
Starcraft<00:00:51.180> already<00:00:51.510> before<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:52.410> even

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
Starcraft already before I would even

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229 
Starcraft already before I would even
like<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.399> consider<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.000> billboard

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
like you know consider this billboard

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
like you know consider this billboard
now<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> exact<00:00:55.440> build<00:00:55.710> order<00:00:56.010> that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
now in the exact build order that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
now in the exact build order that
Scarlett<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.820> she<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:57.629> completely

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
Scarlett does she actually completely

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.930 
Scarlett does she actually completely
skips<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.010> road<00:00:59.190> foreign<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.789> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
skips out the road foreign and this is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
skips out the road foreign and this is
something<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.420> she<00:01:00.629> plays<00:01:01.020> minigun<00:01:01.500> she

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
something because she plays minigun she

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
something because she plays minigun she
knows<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.250> minigun<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> likely<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.270> gonna

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
knows that minigun is likely not gonna

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
knows that minigun is likely not gonna
do<00:01:03.660> any<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> gateway<00:01:04.320> harassment<00:01:05.010> early

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
do any kind of gateway harassment early

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
do any kind of gateway harassment early
on<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.760> she<00:01:05.850> knows<00:01:06.150> she<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:06.600> skip

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on so she knows she can actually skip

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
on so she knows she can actually skip
that<00:01:07.200> however<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.130> you're<00:01:08.369> playing<00:01:08.760> yourself

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that however if you're playing yourself

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
that however if you're playing yourself
you're<00:01:09.510> likely<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:10.080> want<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.439> builder<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you're likely gonna want that builder so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.230 
you're likely gonna want that builder so
if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> take<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> look<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> written

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
if you take a look at the written

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
if you take a look at the written
description<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:13.439> isn't<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> link<00:01:13.920> right

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
see that I put up the roach worm right

Scarlett<00:01:21.390> skips<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.619> safe

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
Scarlett skips it just to be safe

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
keep in mind this is definitely a great

started third gas guys in the next row
as<00:03:14.660> well<00:03:14.840> now<00:03:15.079> normally<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.650> would<00:03:15.829> also<00:03:16.010> be

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
as well now normally this would also be

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
instantly start a Hydra stand right here

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.400 
instantly start a Hydra stand right here
and<00:03:58.700> this<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.510> point<00:03:59.690> where<00:03:59.959> she<00:04:00.079> stops

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
and this is the point where she stops

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.170 
and this is the point where she stops
droning<00:04:00.829> she<00:04:00.980> has<00:04:01.130> max<00:04:01.430> saturation<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.060> all

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
droning she has max saturation in all

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.240 
droning she has max saturation in all
bases<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.620> moment<00:04:03.859> where<00:04:04.130> she

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
bases and this is the moment where she

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.770 
bases and this is the moment where she
starts<00:04:04.579> adding<00:04:04.760> on<00:04:04.970> more<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.329> more<00:04:05.389> queens

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
starts adding on more and more queens

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.409 
starts adding on more and more queens
and<00:04:05.989> more<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.829> more<00:04:07.040> hydrolysed<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:08.090> right

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
and more and more hydrolysed so right

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.270 
and more and more hydrolysed so right
when<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.690> hydras<00:04:09.049> then<00:04:09.230> finishes<00:04:09.739> you<00:04:10.010> need

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
when the hydras then finishes you need

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.339 
when the hydras then finishes you need
to<00:04:10.430> make<00:04:10.579> sure<00:04:10.790> he<00:04:11.000> can<00:04:11.150> start<00:04:11.419> non-stop<00:04:12.049> unit

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
to make sure he can start non-stop unit

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.080 
to make sure he can start non-stop unit
production<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:12.889> you<00:04:12.919> need<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.430> have<00:04:13.579> the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
production so you need to have the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.759

hydrolyzed and finishes you will start

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.839 
hydrolyzed and finishes you will start
the<00:04:18.139> groove<00:04:18.409> spinal<00:04:18.799> grain<00:04:19.009> as<00:04:19.129> well<00:04:19.189> as<00:04:19.699> the

finishing<00:04:21.919> up<00:04:22.099> right<00:04:22.340> now<00:04:22.490> will<00:04:22.759> actually

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
finishing up right now will actually

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.730 
finishing up right now will actually
finish<00:04:23.389> right<00:04:23.719> before<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.319> push<00:04:24.560> will

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
finish right before that push will

finish right before that push will
eventually<00:04:25.310> happens<00:04:25.639> so<00:04:26.150> she<00:04:26.210> needs<00:04:26.509> to<00:04:26.659> make

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
eventually happens so she needs to make

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.330 
eventually happens so she needs to make
sure<00:04:26.840> she<00:04:27.229> makes<00:04:27.409> as<00:04:27.560> many<00:04:27.800> units<00:04:28.129> as<00:04:28.219> she

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
sure she makes as many units as she

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.369 
sure she makes as many units as she

bush is going on however she is going to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.510 
bush is going on however she is going to
reinforce<00:04:47.599> with<00:04:48.020> more<00:04:48.259> and<00:04:48.409> more<00:04:48.439> queens<00:04:48.830> more

and<00:04:49.699> more<00:04:49.819> heartless<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:50.659> she<00:04:50.810> will<00:04:50.900> also

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
and more heartless but she will also

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.200 
and more heartless but she will also
start<00:04:51.590> adding<00:04:51.860> in<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.069> bunch<00:04:52.099> of<00:04:52.460> circuits<00:04:52.819> keep

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
start adding in a bunch of circuits keep

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.760 
start adding in a bunch of circuits keep
in<00:04:53.360> mind<00:04:53.569> that<00:04:53.719> you<00:04:53.870> need<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.199> hit<00:04:54.319> a<00:04:54.500> right

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
in mind that you need to hit a right

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.409 
in mind that you need to hit a right
around<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.159> same<00:04:55.370> time<00:04:55.610> as<00:04:55.849> Scarlett<00:04:56.240> us

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
around the same time as Scarlett us

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.269 
around the same time as Scarlett us
because<00:04:56.870> if<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.199> give<00:04:57.349> the<00:04:57.500> Prados<00:04:57.889> too<00:04:58.099> much

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
because if you give the Prados too much

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.159 
because if you give the Prados too much
time<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.699> actually<00:04:58.819> macro<00:04:59.330> up<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.599> big<00:04:59.810> army

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
time to actually macro up a big army

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.649 
time to actually macro up a big army
there's<00:05:00.650> absolutely<00:05:01.400> no<00:05:01.849> way<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.270> this<00:05:02.419> bush

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
there's absolutely no way that this bush

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.300 
there's absolutely no way that this bush
will<00:05:02.870> actually<00:05:03.199> work<00:05:03.439> so<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.800> will<00:05:03.979> need<00:05:04.189> to

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
will actually work so you will need to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.219 
will actually work so you will need to
practice<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.819> until<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.569> actually<00:05:05.750> manage

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
practice this until you actually manage

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.260 
practice this until you actually manage
to<00:05:06.259> hit<00:05:06.560> right<00:05:07.129> around<00:05:07.279> to<00:05:07.580> ten<00:05:07.849> and<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.120> half

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
to hit right around to ten and a half

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.329 
to hit right around to ten and a half
minute<00:05:08.629> mark<00:05:08.659> like<00:05:09.319> scarlet<00:05:09.740> dust<00:05:09.949> with<00:05:10.129> all

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:10.339 
minute mark like scarlet dust with all

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.309 
minute mark like scarlet dust with all
the<00:05:10.430> upgrades<00:05:10.610> finished<00:05:11.389> up<00:05:11.539> at<00:05:11.719> this<00:05:12.050> point

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
the upgrades finished up at this point

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.869 
the upgrades finished up at this point
she<00:05:12.529> will<00:05:12.620> just<00:05:12.830> simply<00:05:13.189> over<00:05:13.610> run<00:05:13.759> her

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
she will just simply over run her

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.029 
she will just simply over run her
opponent<00:05:14.419> while<00:05:14.779> reinforcing<00:05:15.529> with<00:05:15.620> more<00:05:15.860> and

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
opponent while reinforcing with more and

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.189 
opponent while reinforcing with more and
more<00:05:16.099> units<00:05:16.460> out<00:05:16.639> of<00:05:16.969> the<00:05:17.060> United<00:05:17.360> form<00:05:17.599> so

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
more units out of the United form so

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.269 
more units out of the United form so
yeah<00:05:18.349> that<00:05:18.589> is<00:05:18.680> pretty<00:05:18.710> much<00:05:18.979> it<00:05:19.039> and

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
yeah that is pretty much it and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.429 
yeah that is pretty much it and
relatively<00:05:19.789> easy<00:05:19.909> to<00:05:20.389> execute<00:05:20.689> build<00:05:21.110> order
