00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.390 
well metered
the<00:02:31.450> handling<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:31.989> phenomenal<00:02:32.590> has<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> really

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the handling is phenomenal has a really

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.699 
the handling is phenomenal has a really
really<00:02:33.610> low<00:02:33.970> center<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.390> gravity<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.500> now

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
really low center of gravity and now

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.250 
really low center of gravity and now
it's<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.980> little<00:02:36.190> bit<00:02:36.310> long<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.870> wheelbase

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it's a little bit long in the wheelbase

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.530 
it's a little bit long in the wheelbase
but<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.890> actually<00:02:39.670> steers<00:02:39.910> really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
but it actually steers really

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.509 
but it actually steers really
maneuverable<00:02:40.989> II<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:41.920> stable<00:02:42.160> -

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
maneuverable II and it's stable -

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.150 
maneuverable II and it's stable -
probably<00:02:43.239> my<00:02:43.480> only<00:02:43.750> one<00:02:43.930> gripe<00:02:44.260> with<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
probably my only one gripe with the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.460 
probably my only one gripe with the
overall<00:02:45.430> handling<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.750> shock<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
overall handling is the shock in the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.110 
overall handling is the shock in the
fork<00:02:47.739> are<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> little<00:02:48.040> bit<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.459> fast<00:02:48.819> it's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
fork are a little bit like fast it's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.360 
fork are a little bit like fast it's
kind<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:49.450> springy<00:02:49.900> ride<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.590> think<00:02:51.220> that's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
kind of a springy ride I think that's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.009 
kind of a springy ride I think that's
kind<00:02:51.579> of<00:02:51.640> how<00:02:51.760> they<00:02:51.910> got<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.269> comfort<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.840> high

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
kind of how they got the comfort so high

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.780 
kind of how they got the comfort so high
like<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.470> could<00:02:53.620> ride<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.129> thing<00:02:54.190> over<00:02:54.640> like

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
like you could ride this thing over like

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.420 
like you could ride this thing over like
rough<00:02:55.030> pavement<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.690> bumps<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.890> soaks

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
rough pavement and bumps and it soaks

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.520 
rough pavement and bumps and it soaks
them<00:02:57.670> up<00:02:57.760> real<00:02:58.000> nice<00:02:58.239> but<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.870> kind<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.110> springs

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
them up real nice but it kind of springs

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.110 
them up real nice but it kind of springs
up<00:02:59.739> kind<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.040> fast<00:03:00.099> kind<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> gets<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.940> little

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
up kind of fast kind of gets a little

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.000 
up kind of fast kind of gets a little
bit<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.360> bouncy<00:03:01.720> ride<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.470> that's<00:03:02.650> just<00:03:02.860> me

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
bit of a bouncy ride and that's just me

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220 
bit of a bouncy ride and that's just me
by<00:03:03.160> myself<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.760> mean<00:03:03.940> I'm<00:03:04.090> sure<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.810> had<00:03:04.989> both

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
by myself I mean I'm sure you had both

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470 
by myself I mean I'm sure you had both
hard<00:03:05.500> cases<00:03:05.950> loaded<00:03:06.250> down<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.459> gear<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.090> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
hard cases loaded down with gear and a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.180 
hard cases loaded down with gear and a
passenger<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.379> probably<00:03:08.799> even<00:03:08.920> more

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
passenger it's probably even more

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.699 
passenger it's probably even more
springy<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:10.390> uh<00:03:10.420> that's<00:03:10.900> probably<00:03:11.319> my<00:03:11.440> only

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
springy but uh that's probably my only

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.410 
springy but uh that's probably my only
gripe<00:03:11.920> on<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.519> overall<00:03:12.790> handling

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.550 

there's<00:03:16.420> really<00:03:16.600> not<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.870> whole<00:03:16.990> lot<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.500> say

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
there's really not a whole lot to say

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.340 
there's really not a whole lot to say
that<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:17.980> bad<00:03:18.850> about<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.330> bike<00:03:19.600> it's<00:03:19.959> not<00:03:20.140> my

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
that I bad about this bike it's not my

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.020 
that I bad about this bike it's not my
cup<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.590> tea<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.830> definitely<00:03:21.459> wouldn't<00:03:21.670> get<00:03:21.850> one

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
cup of tea I definitely wouldn't get one

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.360 
cup of tea I definitely wouldn't get one
I<00:03:22.060> want<00:03:22.390> something<00:03:22.600> more<00:03:22.750> sporty<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:23.830> if

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
I want something more sporty but if

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.040 
I want something more sporty but if
