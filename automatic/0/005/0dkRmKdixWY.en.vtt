00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 it's your team that's good 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.730
 it's daniel actually quite a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.860
 league team 1 is really not going to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 figure and that's my team speaking 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.160
 squad their team 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.750
 I think that instead of listening to me 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.279
 when I see that he was obliged to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189
 to enter as many good players is 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 already he was also doing a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.970
 assistant we do not know how to find 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.410
 apologize for not looking for excuses and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.699
 we have the size is in front but ibra 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.810
 and cavani so that I do not have to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.969
 show earlier and it starts to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.149
 get stuck on the pond but the families 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.620
 how many families that emerges in front of and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.340
 I think more lions we are at 90 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 % of possession the selection also comes 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 pawns i'm a start of the match but 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 it's wonderful break the game they do not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.500
 are not well stone laisné worried 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 spent eight years you looked pale to me have a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.109
 little more know this phase 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.640
 classic you feel me suares bumblebee 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.340
 so it evolves but it's his first 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.719
 to the cameras understood if the address is its 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.530
 first opportunity of a wing of the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.670
 medicine and science 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.290
 what is incredible is my 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.820
 domination it's amazing I 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.729
 did not think I would ask the temple 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.979
 here and there we can choose but 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 belatedly you told me done then 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.420
 pressed and me if I had done like 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 usually manage his life but yet that 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 will let me go 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.159
 Student scholarships but I 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 your age she controls mount pretty the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.579
 eat on the head the meaning well what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 what makes my right back and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.180
 all the time dropped 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.870
 it was he who said the adage there was 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.530
 three monks he took two seasons 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.580
 all ways to play there I would like 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.660
 know why but they go there 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.660
 no pressure at retirement so that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.990
 these oscars it's Oscar oscar that 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.600
 temporary 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.850
 I start to be embarrassed actually I like 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:16.330
 alright that's okay let's go go 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.330
 go animate the bruce arena to the state 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.860
 but still it was not no to everything 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.989
 what happened so far the spans 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.720
 local is the matches and not how 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.590
 he does that serves to put his pregnancy but 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.380
 you hate him minutes 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.610
 yes he said yes that's it the champions 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.620
 of the world I tell you that I do not do you 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.060
 loved your bubble which is beautiful the good and I 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.110
 had to be excellent and only enough that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.160
 it's pretty amazing what's going on 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.970
 from the beginning I do not even understand 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.950
 how can you beat me 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.239
 this is the box frankly it's a 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.640
 other match than franche-comté 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.890
 but this is not an anomaly he did not 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.370
 not a smash the nièvre what is it 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.500
 this delirium 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.750
 but there if there is a return match to my 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.519
 Father Abbot Pierre the worst 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.269

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.709

 I'm completely satisfied with this 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.290
