of<00:05:46.740> carbon<00:05:47.400> sitting<00:05:47.969> in<00:05:48.030> there<00:05:49.250> in<00:05:50.250> their

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
of carbon sitting in there in their

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.240 
of carbon sitting in there in their
carbon<00:05:52.849> but<00:05:53.990> you<00:05:54.990> see<00:05:55.319> that<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.830> see<00:05:55.860> the

carbon but you see that you see the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.670 
carbon but you see that you see the
cross<00:05:56.490> hatch<00:05:56.849> marks<00:05:57.240> on<00:05:57.539> these<00:05:57.690> cylinders<00:05:58.409> and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
cross hatch marks on these cylinders and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.730 
cross hatch marks on these cylinders and
these<00:05:58.830> no<00:05:59.069> lip<00:05:59.370> whatsoever<00:06:00.030> so<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:01.139> block<00:06:01.440> is

know 16 years old its original to this

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.950 
know 16 years old its original to this
motor<00:07:19.440> so<00:07:20.750> chances<00:07:21.750> are<00:07:21.930> it<00:07:22.139> does<00:07:22.410> leave<00:07:23.069> me

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.250 
any way you can save lifters out and

any way you can save lifters out and
what<00:07:35.250> I'm<00:07:35.400> doing<00:07:35.430> is<00:07:36.590> around<00:07:38.449> just<00:07:39.449> line<00:07:39.690> them

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 
what I'm doing is around just line them

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.310 
what I'm doing is around just line them
up<00:07:40.139> the<00:07:40.620> l4<00:07:41.160> front<00:07:41.520> and<00:07:42.060> order<00:07:42.810> they<00:07:42.900> come<00:07:43.110> out

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
up the l4 front and order they come out
