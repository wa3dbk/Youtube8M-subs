100 pluses with so no switching it up a
little<00:00:44.700> bit<00:00:45.320> but<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> talk<00:00:46.980> about

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
little bit but what I want to talk about

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.750 
little bit but what I want to talk about
is<00:00:47.460> tree<00:00:47.789> art<00:00:48.059> treyarch<00:00:48.989> treyarch<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.430> game

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is tree art treyarch treyarch this game

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.729 
is tree art treyarch treyarch this game
right<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.000> could<00:00:51.390> probably<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
right here could probably be one of the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.340 
right here could probably be one of the
best<00:00:53.010> first-person<00:00:53.879> shooters<00:00:54.449> ever<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.230> be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
best first-person shooters ever to be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
best first-person shooters ever to be
created<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.969> what

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
created and I think that's what

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
created and I think that's what
frustrates<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.780> many<00:00:57.989> people<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
frustrates so many people is I get that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860 
frustrates so many people is I get that
nice<00:00:59.280> seat<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.670> toss<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.539> guy<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
nice seat for toss get that guy in the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.229 
nice seat for toss get that guy in the
window<00:01:01.170> pick<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> guy<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:03.120> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
window pick this guy right here but I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
window pick this guy right here but I
think<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.629> what<00:01:03.780> frustrates<00:01:04.290> people<00:01:04.379> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
think that's what frustrates people so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.820 
think that's what frustrates people so
much<00:01:05.189> about<00:01:05.489> black<00:01:06.090> ops<00:01:06.270> 2<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.560> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
much about black ops 2 is that they have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
much about black ops 2 is that they have
literally<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.180> tools<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> best

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
literally the tools to make the best

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.039 
literally the tools to make the best
first-person<00:01:10.500> shooter<00:01:10.950> probably<00:01:11.189> ever<00:01:12.049> but

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
first-person shooter probably ever but

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.539

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
take it completely out the game

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
aim because if they take a completely

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.279 
aim because if they take a completely
off<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.580> game<00:02:06.880> what<00:02:07.510> they<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.810> they<00:02:08.020> admit

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
off the game what they do is they admit

like I said if they would just address a
few<00:02:49.269> things<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:50.290> game<00:02:50.560> could<00:02:50.739> be<00:02:50.890> perfect<00:02:51.489> I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700

couldn't<00:02:52.239> see<00:02:52.360> anything<00:02:52.570> wrong<00:02:52.900> with<00:02:52.959> it

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
couldn't see anything wrong with it

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.870 
couldn't see anything wrong with it
because<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.500> said<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.830> isn't<00:02:53.980> really

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
because like I said there isn't really

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.120 
because like I said there isn't really
anything<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.810> fires<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.500> balancing<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
anything like fires and balancing in the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.400 
anything like fires and balancing in the
guns<00:02:57.340> except<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> SMGs<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:58.780> gotten<00:02:59.019> really

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
guns except the SMGs have gotten really

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.220 
guns except the SMGs have gotten really
weak<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.040> that's<00:03:00.310> another<00:03:00.430> thing<00:03:00.610> too<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.239> felt

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
weak and that's another thing too I felt

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.630 
weak and that's another thing too I felt
like<00:03:02.350> out<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.769> box<00:03:02.980> these<00:03:03.970> guns<00:03:04.239> were<00:03:04.959> not

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
like out the box these guns were not

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.580 
like out the box these guns were not
100%<00:03:06.640> balance<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.269> they<00:03:07.390> were<00:03:07.450> very<00:03:07.810> close<00:03:08.350> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
100% balance but they were very close to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.319 
100% balance but they were very close to
being<00:03:08.800> one<00:03:08.920> hundred<00:03:08.980> percent<00:03:09.190> balance<00:03:09.820> and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
being one hundred percent balance and

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.370 
being one hundred percent balance and
with<00:03:10.510> all<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> nerf<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.110> they've<00:03:11.200> done

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
with all the nerf and they've done

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.280 
with all the nerf and they've done
they've<00:03:11.739> taken<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.130> SMGs<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.850> made<00:03:12.970> it

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
they've taken the SMGs and made it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.350 
they've taken the SMGs and made it
