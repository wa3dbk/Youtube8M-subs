00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
make the gain a bit more exciting people

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.750 
make the gain a bit more exciting people
are<00:01:39.030> starting<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.390> hide<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> bit<00:01:39.990> sooo<00:01:40.170> much

which<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.780> essentially<00:01:56.230> lava<00:01:56.470> pits<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.420> water

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
which is essentially lava pits and water

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.240 
which is essentially lava pits and water
that<00:01:58.750> can<00:01:58.870> be<00:01:59.020> released<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.650> push<00:01:59.920> everyone

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
down into the lava on either side and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.370 
down into the lava on either side and
into<00:02:02.590> each<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.040> pits<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.630> there's<00:02:04.630> also<00:02:04.870> a

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
into each of the pits and there's also a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.850 
into each of the pits and there's also a
food<00:02:05.920> dispenser<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.080> admins<00:02:08.470> can<00:02:08.619> call

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
food dispenser so the admins can call

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.710 
food dispenser so the admins can call
people<00:02:09.010> to<00:02:09.190> come<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.550> say<00:02:09.910> it's<00:02:10.479> going<00:02:10.540> to<00:02:10.660> be

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
people to come and say it's going to be

people to come and say it's going to be
released<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.170> then<00:02:11.320> obviously<00:02:11.770> release<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
released and then obviously release the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.620 
released and then obviously release the
flood<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.940> push<00:02:13.930> people<00:02:14.260> into<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.530> lava<00:02:14.710> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
then you've got through snow box and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.490 
then you've got through snow box and
which<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.330> essentially<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:25.020> massive<00:02:26.020> challenge

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
which is essentially a massive challenge

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.310 
which is essentially a massive challenge
and<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:28.150> lots<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.570> different<00:02:28.930> chests

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
and with lots of different chests

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.400 
and with lots of different chests
hitting<00:02:29.590> around<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.920> place<00:02:31.800> yeah<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:34.410> it's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
hitting around the place yeah so it's

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.210 
hitting around the place yeah so it's
it's<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.860> reasonably<00:02:36.250> small<00:02:36.340> map<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.980> should

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
it's a reasonably small map you should

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.920 
it's a reasonably small map you should

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.570 
picture on one of the corner posts here
and<00:02:43.600> what<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.870> means<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.680> you're<00:02:45.400> not

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
and what that means is that you're not

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.729 
and what that means is that you're not
going<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.030> spend<00:02:46.510> hours<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.080> hours<00:02:47.140> looking

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
for people but at the same time until

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.449 
for people but at the same time until
the<00:02:50.200> admins<00:02:50.560> actually<00:02:50.920> burn<00:02:51.100> down<00:02:51.280> the

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
the admins actually burn down the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.010 
the admins actually burn down the
forests<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.120> will<00:02:52.270> be<00:02:52.510> able<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.810> hide<00:02:52.930> and
