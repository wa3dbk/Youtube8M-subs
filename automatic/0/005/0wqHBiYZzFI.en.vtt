I'm<00:02:32.000> at<00:02:32.360> first<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.900> thought<00:02:33.110> an<00:02:34.010> American

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
I'm at first I thought an American

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.150 
I'm at first I thought an American
playing<00:02:35.210> this<00:02:35.570> sort<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:36.160> stereotypical

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
playing this sort of stereotypical

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.550 
playing this sort of stereotypical
Japanese<00:02:38.060> ninja<00:02:38.360> character<00:02:38.960> I<00:02:39.200> thought<00:02:39.380> that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
Japanese ninja character I thought that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.740 
Japanese ninja character I thought that
was<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.830> going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.100> cheesy<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:41.120> sure<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
was just going to be cheesy it sure it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.780 
was just going to be cheesy it sure it
felt<00:02:42.110> like<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.350> definite<00:02:42.740> throwback<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.580> stuff

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
felt like a definite throwback to stuff

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.870 
felt like a definite throwback to stuff
like<00:02:43.910> American<00:02:44.540> Ninja<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:46.640> just

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
like American Ninja but it it just

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.400 
like American Ninja but it it just
seemed<00:02:47.270> really<00:02:47.510> cheesy<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.050> didn't<00:02:48.230> feel<00:02:48.350> like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
seemed really cheesy I didn't feel like

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.740 
seemed really cheesy I didn't feel like

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
I'm pronouncing that right plays

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.589 
I'm pronouncing that right plays
masazuka<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.419> villain<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.990> he<00:04:39.830> he<00:04:40.599> he's

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
masazuka the villain and he he he's

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.480 
masazuka the villain and he he he's
played<00:04:41.870> mostly<00:04:42.139> he's<00:04:42.440> actually<00:04:42.650> then<00:04:42.949> I<00:04:43.250> think

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
played mostly he's actually then I think

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.219 
played mostly he's actually then I think
he's<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.849> ninja<00:04:44.210> sort<00:04:44.449> of<00:04:44.539> referenced<00:04:45.020> in<00:04:45.139> the
