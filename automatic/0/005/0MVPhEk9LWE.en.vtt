can really take Assassin's Creed

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.750 
can really take Assassin's Creed
real<00:03:56.469> history<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:57.010> mean<00:03:57.099> it's<00:03:57.459> not<00:03:57.549> like<00:03:57.609> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
real history I mean it's not like the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.220 
real history I mean it's not like the
Templars<00:03:58.180> are<00:03:58.299> really<00:03:58.599> overlooking<00:03:59.109> our

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.280 

so<00:04:06.950> back<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.700> reality<00:04:08.330> think<00:04:08.540> about<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.900> it

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
so back to reality think about this it

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.630 
so back to reality think about this it
might<00:04:09.530> actually<00:04:09.770> be<00:04:10.010> possible<00:04:10.220> for<00:04:10.550> the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
might actually be possible for the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.070 
might actually be possible for the
Templars<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.150> kidnap<00:04:11.450> faith<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:11.900> the

next time as we take a break from the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.270 
next time as we take a break from the
six<00:04:23.810> degrees<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.080> separation<00:04:24.200> because<00:04:25.100> we're

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
six degrees of separation because we're

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.310 
six degrees of separation because we're
going<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.520> prove<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:25.940> how<00:04:26.330> every<00:04:26.900> Nintendo
