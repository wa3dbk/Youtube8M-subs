 Slate moves up 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:52.829

 it's too late for that 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.689
 the 2 2 through

 definitely not from here 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.580
 so b that has that 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.580
 as a background they do not know yet 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.710
 the only problem is that answers can be both sides 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.460
