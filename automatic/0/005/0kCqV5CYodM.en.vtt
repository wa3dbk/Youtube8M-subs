you know suburban life and and then it
started<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.800> become<00:00:20.039> more<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.939> general

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
started to become more of a general

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.040 
started to become more of a general
thing<00:00:22.230> about<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.580> humans<00:00:24.420> life

thing about you know how as humans life

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.420 
thing about you know how as humans life
is<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.320> complicated<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.010> sometimes<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
is so complicated and sometimes that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.339 
is so complicated and sometimes that
think<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.699> envy<00:00:27.000> animals<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.630> how<00:00:27.720> everything

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
think we envy animals for how everything

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.230 
think we envy animals for how everything
is<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.310> simplistic<00:00:29.699> for<00:00:30.000> them<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is a little more simplistic for them and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.200 
is a little more simplistic for them and
