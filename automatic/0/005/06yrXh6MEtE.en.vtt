00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.190 
use on their sport bikes so took us
about<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.979> year<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.549> develop<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:08.390> we<00:02:09.019> have<00:02:09.170> a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
about a year to develop it but we have a

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.220 
about a year to develop it but we have a
solution<00:02:09.530> for<00:02:09.709> sport<00:02:10.189> bikes<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:11.230> basically

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
solution for sport bikes that basically

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
solution for sport bikes that basically
gives<00:02:12.499> you<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.739> option<00:02:13.219> to<00:02:13.249> use<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
gives you the option to use the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.589 
gives you the option to use the
inches<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.599> each<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.940> they<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.239> converted

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
inches on each and they can be converted

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.670 
inches on each and they can be converted
from<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.950> bolt<00:02:19.250> down<00:02:19.519> they're<00:02:20.000> identical<00:02:20.680> so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
from this bolt down they're identical so

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.490 
from this bolt down they're identical so
this<00:02:22.459> piece<00:02:23.000> just<00:02:23.030> swaps<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:23.930> right<00:02:24.230> there

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
this piece just swaps out right there

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.619 
this piece just swaps out right there
quick<00:02:24.830> change<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.760> got<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> set<00:02:26.180> inches

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
quick change and you got to set inches

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.009 
quick change and you got to set inches
for<00:02:26.840> both<00:02:26.989> bikes<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:28.310> set<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.700> cinches<00:02:29.180> comes

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
for both bikes the set of cinches comes

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.380 
for both bikes the set of cinches comes
with<00:02:30.230> these<00:02:30.379> single<00:02:30.680> point<00:02:31.040> anchors<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
with these single point anchors here the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.839 
with these single point anchors here the
track<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.870> an<00:02:32.989> accessory<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:34.099> can<00:02:34.129> run<00:02:34.489> a

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
track is an accessory you can run a

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.360 
track is an accessory you can run a
six-foot<00:02:35.420> strip<00:02:35.750> across<00:02:35.959> your<00:02:36.379> trailer<00:02:36.980> fit

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370
