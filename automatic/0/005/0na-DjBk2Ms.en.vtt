00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.970 
particular fan of those circle watches I
actually<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.840> both<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> these<00:00:31.500> watches

actually like both of these watches

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually like both of these watches
because<00:00:32.309> unlike<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.270> Moto<00:00:33.510> 360<00:00:34.260> where<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> was

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because unlike the Moto 360 where it was

because unlike the Moto 360 where it was
a<00:00:34.739> good<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.190> attempt<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.000> didn't<00:00:36.329> quite<00:00:36.570> hit

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
a good first attempt it didn't quite hit

them<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:40.079> quite<00:00:40.350> appealing<00:00:40.710> in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
them that is actually quite appealing in

slightly bigger than the Huawei watch

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
slightly bigger than the Huawei watch
because<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> urban<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> following<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
because the urban is following the you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 
because the urban is following the you
know<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> watch<00:00:57.809> casing<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> screen<00:00:58.920> size<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
know the watch casing the screen size is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
know the watch casing the screen size is
a<00:00:59.460> slightly<00:00:59.969> smaller<00:01:00.359> than<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.989> Huawei<00:01:01.350> watch

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
a slightly smaller than the Huawei watch

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
a slightly smaller than the Huawei watch
on<00:01:01.890> top<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> Huawei<00:01:03.239> watch<00:01:03.449> actually

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
on top of that the Huawei watch actually

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
on top of that the Huawei watch actually
has<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> higher<00:01:04.500> screen<00:01:04.920> resolution<00:01:05.460> than<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
LG G watch urban now in terms of this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.920 
LG G watch urban now in terms of this
screen<00:01:08.700> size<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.810> gonna

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
screen size I don't see that's gonna

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
screen size I don't see that's gonna
make<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> huge<00:01:10.500> difference<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
make a huge difference but it is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
make a huge difference but it is
slightly<00:01:12.630> better<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.080> those<00:01:13.170> who<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.650> care

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
slightly better for those who do care

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
slightly better for those who do care
about<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> stuff<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.330> other<00:01:15.570> major

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
about that stuff and the one other major

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.539 
about that stuff and the one other major
difference<00:01:16.259> between<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.979> watches<00:01:17.400> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
difference between the watches is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
difference between the watches is
actually<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> battery<00:01:18.390> size<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
actually the battery size now that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
actually the battery size now that
Huawei<00:01:19.500> watch<00:01:19.799> actually<00:01:20.280> Rob's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.610> 300<00:01:21.240> mAh

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
battery size which is actually similar

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.149

a 410 mAh sized battery so a quite
bigger<00:01:39.360> battery<00:01:39.930> size<00:01:40.229> um<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.799> compared

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
bigger battery size um if you compared

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
bigger battery size um if you compared
to<00:01:41.340> apples<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> apples<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.420> hopefully<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to apples to apples so hopefully that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
to apples to apples so hopefully that
means<00:01:43.530> longer<00:01:44.070> battery<00:01:44.250> life<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.630> than

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
means longer battery life so other than

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
means longer battery life so other than
that<00:01:45.960> both<00:01:46.290> devices<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.950> much<00:01:47.070> share<00:01:47.250> the

that both devices pretty much share the

from the technical stuff in terms of
looks<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.969> actually<00:01:57.270> digging<00:01:57.689> both<00:01:58.079> designs

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
looks I'm actually digging both designs

looks I'm actually digging both designs
now<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> Moto<00:01:59.610> 360<00:02:00.270> didn't<00:02:00.659> win<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.960> over<00:02:00.990> with

I<00:02:16.099> might<00:02:16.489> be<00:02:16.610> tempted<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.209> least<00:02:17.300> dive<00:02:17.690> in

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
I might be tempted to at least dive in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.380 
I might be tempted to at least dive in
and<00:02:18.110> try<00:02:18.560> them<00:02:18.800> out<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> little<00:02:19.190> bit<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.180> feel

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
and try them out a little bit and I feel

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.580 
and try them out a little bit and I feel
that<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.660> different<00:02:21.080> bands<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.500> you

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that with the different bands that you

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.860 
that with the different bands that you
could<00:02:21.890> put<00:02:22.069> on<00:02:22.099> both<00:02:22.430> these<00:02:22.670> devices<00:02:22.849> they<00:02:23.690> can

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
could put on both these devices they can

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.320 
could put on both these devices they can
fit<00:02:24.050> almost<00:02:24.230> any<00:02:24.500> need<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.700> terms<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.150> feel

obviously I haven't tried a device's by
I've<00:02:28.250> tried<00:02:28.489> comparable<00:02:29.150> devices<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.900> both

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
I've tried comparable devices and both

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.449 
I've tried comparable devices and both
of<00:02:30.560> them<00:02:30.650> look<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.010> can<00:02:31.069> be<00:02:31.160> quite

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
of them look like they can be quite
