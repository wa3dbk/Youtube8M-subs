rollers<00:00:30.210> we'll<00:00:30.359> look<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:30.960> as

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
rollers we'll look at it now as

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.709 
rollers we'll look at it now as
flattened<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.480> we're<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
flattened as well so what we're going to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
flattened as well so what we're going to
have<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.489> get<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.170> connector<00:00:37.170> off<00:00:37.460> make

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
have to do is get the connector off make

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
have to do is get the connector off make
sure<00:00:38.489> everything<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> undamaged<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.260> the

sure everything is undamaged on the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
sure everything is undamaged on the
board<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.040> solder<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> new<00:00:41.910> connector

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
board and then solder in a new connector

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.860 
board and then solder in a new connector
okay<00:00:42.660> thank<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> connector

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
okay thank you now this is the connector

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.740 
okay thank you now this is the connector
