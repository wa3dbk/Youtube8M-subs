00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
trust him and then he took the long view
and<00:01:54.270> he<00:01:54.840> never<00:01:54.990> changed<00:01:55.440> his<00:01:55.650> way<00:01:56.190> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and he never changed his way of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.460 
and he never changed his way of
measuring<00:01:56.550> himself<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.870> was<00:01:58.200> able<00:01:58.409> to

measuring himself and that was able to
compound<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.190> made<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.940> huge

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
compound over time made a huge

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.390 
compound over time made a huge

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
difference and what is it is there

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.310 
difference and what is it is there
something<00:02:02.820> psychologically<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.050> allows

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
something psychologically that allows

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.590 
something psychologically that allows
him<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.250> completely<00:02:05.450> distanced<00:02:06.450> from

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
is some trained ways of thinking which I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.929

reports you worried about his flops with
USA<00:02:52.019> or<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.409> have<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.739> but<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:54.060> sort<00:02:54.389> of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
USA or what have you but that sort of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.229 
USA or what have you but that sort of
confidence<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.769> see<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.250> usually<00:02:57.000> leads

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
confidence when you see it usually leads

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.349 
confidence when you see it usually leads
to<00:02:57.359> spectacular<00:02:57.870> success<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.359> spectacular

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
to spectacular success and spectacular

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.720 
to spectacular success and spectacular
disastrous<00:03:01.230> blow<00:03:01.470> ups<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.920> he<00:03:02.400> doesn't<00:03:02.609> seem

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
disastrous blow ups and he doesn't seem

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.770 
disastrous blow ups and he doesn't seem
to<00:03:02.819> have<00:03:02.849> too<00:03:03.000> many<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.420> those

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to have too many of those

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.479 
to have too many of those
so<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.230> he<00:03:04.440> right<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.950> often<00:03:05.129> than<00:03:05.370> most

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
so is he right more often than most

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.179 
so is he right more often than most
people<00:03:05.819> he's<00:03:06.000> his<00:03:06.739> batting<00:03:07.739> average<00:03:07.859> is

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
people he's his batting average is

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.250 
people he's his batting average is
better<00:03:08.459> than<00:03:08.909> most<00:03:09.090> people's<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> think

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
better than most people's but I think

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.349 
better than most people's but I think
what<00:03:10.500> has<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:11.040> been<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.609> winner<00:03:11.849> for<00:03:12.150> him

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
what has really been the winner for him

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.750 
what has really been the winner for him
is<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:13.139> he's<00:03:13.409> really<00:03:13.590> risk-averse<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.489> so

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
is that he's really risk-averse and so

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.479 
is that he's really risk-averse and so
he<00:03:15.420> makes<00:03:15.930> sure<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.500> he<00:03:16.680> doesn't<00:03:16.920> take<00:03:17.189> a<00:03:17.250> lot

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
he makes sure that he doesn't take a lot

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.580 
he makes sure that he doesn't take a lot
of<00:03:17.639> risk<00:03:17.909> so<00:03:18.150> when<00:03:18.359> he<00:03:18.480> thinks<00:03:18.810> he's<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:19.139> big

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
of risk so when he thinks he's got big

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.099 
of risk so when he thinks he's got big
odds<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:19.950> his<00:03:19.980> favor<00:03:20.069> he<00:03:20.489> bets<00:03:20.670> huge<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.810> when

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
odds in his favor he bets huge but when

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.990 
odds in his favor he bets huge but when
he's<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.859> sure<00:03:23.069> he<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:23.549> limits<00:03:23.939> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
he's not so sure he really limits the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.089 
he's not so sure he really limits the
downside<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.870> he<00:03:25.230> would<00:03:25.500> always<00:03:25.620> say<00:03:25.829> don't

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
downside and he would always say don't

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.879 
downside and he would always say don't
lose<00:03:26.250> money<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.790> rule<00:03:27.090> number<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.889> anyone
