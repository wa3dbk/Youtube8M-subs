agenda to resolve the economic crisis at

agenda to resolve the economic crisis at
the<00:02:07.619> expensive<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.340> ordinary<00:02:08.700> people<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the expensive of ordinary people and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.119 
the expensive of ordinary people and
that's<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.560> background<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> this

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that's what is the background to this

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.820 
that's what is the background to this
debate<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.849> real<00:02:12.030> tough<00:02:12.330> time

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
debate so we're in real tough time

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.740 
debate so we're in real tough time
and<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.460> think<00:02:13.520> that's<00:02:13.700> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> be<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.510> theme

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and I think that's going to be the theme

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.600 
and I think that's going to be the theme
