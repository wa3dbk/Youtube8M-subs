with<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> iPad<00:02:14.230> air<00:02:14.380> which<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.400> always<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.790> plus

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
with the iPad air which is always a plus

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
with the iPad air which is always a plus
now<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.620> also<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:18.190> an<00:02:18.280> overall<00:02:18.580> refresh<00:02:19.240> on

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
now we also get an overall refresh on

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.840 
now we also get an overall refresh on
the<00:02:19.510> design<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> iPad<00:02:20.890> air<00:02:21.160> has<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.610> same

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the design so the iPad air has the same

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.050 
the design so the iPad air has the same
form<00:02:22.270> factor<00:02:22.540> off<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.290> iPad<00:02:23.740> Mini<00:02:24.070> which<00:02:24.850> has

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
form factor off the iPad Mini which has

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.570 
form factor off the iPad Mini which has
been<00:02:25.270> on<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> market<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.470> while<00:02:26.710> so<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:27.490> a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
been on the market for a while so it's a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.820 
been on the market for a while so it's a
blown-up<00:02:27.910> version<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.960> iPad<00:02:29.260> Mini<00:02:29.320> that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
blown-up version of the iPad Mini that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.760 
blown-up version of the iPad Mini that
we<00:02:29.950> already<00:02:30.100> have<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> market<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.530> next

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
we already have on the market so next

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.310 
we already have on the market so next
let's<00:02:33.250> take<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.520> look<00:02:33.730> at<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.910> processor<00:02:34.690> so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
let's take a look at the processor so

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.380 
let's take a look at the processor so
the<00:02:35.440> iPad<00:02:35.770> air<00:02:35.800> comes<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> same<00:02:36.670> processor

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the iPad air comes to the same processor

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.950 
the iPad air comes to the same processor
found<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.020> iPhone<00:02:38.380> 5s<00:02:38.980> which<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.960> 64-bit

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
found in the iPhone 5s which is a 64-bit

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.880 
found in the iPhone 5s which is a 64-bit
a7<00:02:42.270> dual-core<00:02:43.270> processor<00:02:44.050> now<00:02:44.590> we<00:02:44.650> don't

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
a7 dual-core processor now we don't

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.580 
a7 dual-core processor now we don't
exactly<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.490> what<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> frequency<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
exactly know what the frequency of the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.300 
exactly know what the frequency of the
cores<00:02:48.370> are<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> iPad<00:02:50.410> air<00:02:50.650> might<00:02:51.040> come

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
cores are so the iPad air might come

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.490 
cores are so the iPad air might come
with<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.490> higher<00:02:51.760> clock<00:02:52.150> frequency<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.320> may

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
with a higher clock frequency or it may

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.730 
with a higher clock frequency or it may
come<00:02:53.740> with<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> same<00:02:54.510> 1.3<00:02:55.510> gigahertz<00:02:55.900> as<00:02:56.350> the

come with the same 1.3 gigahertz as the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.870 
come with the same 1.3 gigahertz as the
iPhone<00:02:57.100> 5s<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:58.200> personally<00:02:59.200> doubt<00:02:59.440> that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
iPhone 5s I personally doubt that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.670 
iPhone 5s I personally doubt that
however<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.120> does<00:03:01.360> have<00:03:01.390> one<00:03:02.020> gigabytes<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
however it does have one gigabytes of

however it does have one gigabytes of
ddr3<00:03:03.190> RAM<00:03:03.990> now<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.050> iPad<00:03:05.290> 4<00:03:05.740> came<00:03:06.220> with<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.490> 1.2

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
ddr3 RAM now the iPad 4 came with a 1.2

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.710
