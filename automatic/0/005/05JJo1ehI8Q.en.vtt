paper<00:01:33.039> towel<00:01:33.310> roll<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.969> then<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.990> put<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
paper towel roll and then I put the

cotton<00:01:35.920> squares<00:01:36.909> on<00:01:37.359> to<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.670> around<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
cotton squares on to it and around the

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.459 
cotton squares on to it and around the
outside<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.329> it's<00:01:40.479> stuck<00:01:40.749> to<00:01:40.929> it<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.200> dried

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
it's probably the thing that takes the

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.219 
it's probably the thing that takes the
longest<00:01:46.689> is<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.880> drip<00:01:48.880> wax<00:01:49.119> all<00:01:49.539> around<00:01:50.109> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
longest is a drip wax all around the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.340 
longest is a drip wax all around the
outside<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:50.709> the<00:01:51.189> cotton<00:01:52.090> now<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.509> make<00:01:53.139> it<00:01:53.319> a

outside of the cotton now and make it a

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.190 
outside of the cotton now and make it a
nice<00:01:53.649> good<00:01:53.979> layer<00:01:54.279> of<00:01:54.520> candle<00:01:55.029> wax<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.600> i'll

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
nice good layer of candle wax so i'll

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.809 
nice good layer of candle wax so i'll
show<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.439> how<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.619> looks<00:01:56.979> like<00:01:58.439> alright<00:01:59.439> so

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
show you how that looks like alright so

here it is with the wax coat on the
outside<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:06.490> took<00:02:06.759> me<00:02:06.789> probably<00:02:07.389> like<00:02:08.320> 20

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
outside and it took me probably like 20

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.920 
outside and it took me probably like 20
minutes<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:09.160> burn<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.550> all<00:02:09.670> on<00:02:09.850> there<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.750> like

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
minutes to burn it all on there and like

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.089 
minutes to burn it all on there and like
i<00:02:11.050> said<00:02:11.110> there's<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.680> lot<00:02:11.860> faster<00:02:12.430> if<00:02:12.460> you

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
i said there's a lot faster if you

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.900 
i said there's a lot faster if you
melted<00:02:15.099> like<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.580> pan<00:02:15.880> with<00:02:15.910> liner<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.910> yeah

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
melted like in a pan with liner but yeah

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.020 
melted like in a pan with liner but yeah
and<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.770> wanted<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.130> burn<00:02:21.310> longer<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.880> can

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and if you wanted to burn longer you can

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.900 
and if you wanted to burn longer you can
add<00:02:22.510> another<00:02:22.840> layer<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:24.040> takes<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.730> while

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
add another layer but that takes a while

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.280 
add another layer but that takes a while
but<00:02:25.209> probably<00:02:26.140> worth<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.760> next<00:02:28.569> what<00:02:28.959> we<00:02:29.110> do

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
but probably worth it so next what we do

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.150 
but probably worth it so next what we do
is<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.660> cotton<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:34.830> melt<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.950> bunch

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
is we get the cotton and we melt a bunch

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.070 
is we get the cotton and we melt a bunch
of<00:02:36.250> wax<00:02:36.459> pretty<00:02:36.819> much<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.180> there<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.599> stop<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
of wax pretty much on there and stop it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.500 
of wax pretty much on there and stop it
on<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> inside<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> I'll<00:02:39.970> show<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.269> what<00:02:40.450> that

I'm all done all right so this is what

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.610 
I'm all done all right so this is what
it<00:03:21.670> looks<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.959> melted<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.049> wax<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
it looks like just melted the wax on the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.259 
it looks like just melted the wax on the
cotton<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.160> inside<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:28.650> then<00:03:30.150> what<00:03:31.150> it

cotton on the inside and then what it
looks<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.319> now<00:03:32.440> what<00:03:32.560> I'm<00:03:32.620> going<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.859> want

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
looks like so now what I'm going to want

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.110 
looks like so now what I'm going to want
to<00:03:33.069> do<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:34.380> take<00:03:35.380> some<00:03:35.560> more<00:03:35.709> cotton<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.459> stuff

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
to do is take some more cotton and stuff

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.599 
to do is take some more cotton and stuff
it<00:03:37.269> inside<00:03:37.680> stuff<00:03:38.680> as<00:03:38.799> much<00:03:39.069> as<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.549> in

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
it inside stuff as much as you can in

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.990 
it inside stuff as much as you can in
there<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.560> then<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.310> makes<00:03:42.430> for<00:03:42.639> easier

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
there and then so it makes for easier

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.680 
there and then so it makes for easier
lighting<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.690> then<00:03:45.090> take<00:03:46.090> some<00:03:46.269> more<00:03:46.450> here

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
lighting and then take some more here

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.990 
lighting and then take some more here
and<00:03:47.069> then<00:03:48.069> what<00:03:48.250> you're<00:03:48.430> going<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.609> want<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.850> do

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
and then what you're going to want to do

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.789 
and then what you're going to want to do
is<00:03:49.150> maybe<00:03:49.359> melt<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.780> little<00:03:49.810> bit<00:03:50.139> more<00:03:50.260> wax<00:03:50.560> on

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
is maybe melt a little bit more wax on

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.370 
is maybe melt a little bit more wax on
there<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.310> stays<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.910> just<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.989> make<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.170> good

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
there so it stays in just to make a good

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.539 
there so it stays in just to make a good
way<00:03:53.620> i<00:03:53.650> already<00:03:55.230> put<00:03:56.230> some<00:03:56.470> cotton<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.889> me<00:03:57.040> on

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
this side so this is what it should look

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.550 
this side so this is what it should look
like<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.410> then<00:04:00.150> you'll<00:04:01.150> be<00:04:01.180> about<00:04:01.870> done<00:04:02.109> so

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
wax and make it so it sticks so it would

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.020 
wax and make it so it sticks so it would
make<00:04:22.030> really<00:04:22.659> easy<00:04:22.870> lighting<00:04:23.440> maybe<00:04:24.030> connect

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
make really easy lighting maybe connect

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.620 
make really easy lighting maybe connect
a<00:04:25.390> little<00:04:25.690> bit<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.020> cotton<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.440> both

a little bit of cotton to both
sides<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:28.990> ball<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.550> then<00:04:30.550> you'll<00:04:31.330> be

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
sides of the ball and then you'll be

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.710 
sides of the ball and then you'll be
done<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:34.120> I'll<00:04:34.240> show<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.540> what<00:04:34.630> it

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
done and then I'll show you what it

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.129 
done and then I'll show you what it
looks<00:04:34.780> like<00:04:34.990> when<00:04:35.110> it's<00:04:35.290> lit<00:04:36.630> okay<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:37.990> is

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
looks like when it's lit okay so this is

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.310 
looks like when it's lit okay so this is
the<00:04:38.320> finished<00:04:38.919> product<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.990> when<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.110> lied

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
the finished product and when you lied

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.710 
the finished product and when you lied
it<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.590> want<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.979> be<00:04:42.130> standing<00:04:42.460> up<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
it you want it to be standing up so the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.060 
it you want it to be standing up so the
flame<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.260> get<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.620> on<00:04:44.770> both<00:04:45.040> sides<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:47.070> I'll

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
flame can get in on both sides so I'll

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.189 
flame can get in on both sides so I'll
get<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.580> lit<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:48.970> show<00:04:49.389> you<00:04:49.449> what<00:04:49.630> it's<00:04:49.780> like<00:04:49.930> a

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
get it lit and show you what it's like a

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.760 
get it lit and show you what it's like a
long<00:04:50.440> minute<00:04:51.990> okay<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.050> i<00:04:53.229> just<00:04:53.410> got<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
long minute okay so i just got the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.719 
long minute okay so i just got the
cotton<00:04:54.070> on<00:04:54.160> top<00:04:54.370> lid<00:04:54.870> it's<00:04:55.870> already<00:04:56.110> burning

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
cotton on top lid it's already burning

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:03.090 
cotton on top lid it's already burning
fairly<00:04:57.729> high<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:59.470> did<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.800> with<00:05:01.080> Flint<00:05:02.100> so

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
fairly high and I did that with Flint so

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.060 
fairly high and I did that with Flint so
it<00:05:03.220> wasn't<00:05:03.370> very<00:05:03.580> hard<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.560> couldn't<00:05:05.919> have

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
it wasn't very hard so I couldn't have

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.960 
it wasn't very hard so I couldn't have
the<00:05:06.220> video<00:05:06.370> going<00:05:06.700> when<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.000> did<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.270> but<00:05:08.970> yeah

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
the video going when I did it but yeah

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:26.500 
the video going when I did it but yeah
it<00:05:10.030> should<00:05:10.240> should<00:05:10.840> take<00:05:11.020> off<00:05:11.200> in<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.530> minute

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.920 

so<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.630> caught<00:05:27.840> on<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.140> other<00:05:28.290> side<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.930> yeah

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
so it caught on the other side and yeah

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:43.780 
so it caught on the other side and yeah
there<00:05:31.140> it's<00:05:31.920> going<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:36.060> all<00:05:36.210> that's<00:05:36.450> going

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.260 

show<00:05:44.790> you<00:05:44.820> another<00:05:45.210> thing<00:05:46.070> so<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.400> was<00:05:48.060> in<00:05:48.150> this

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
show you another thing so I was in this

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.030 
show you another thing so I was in this
in<00:05:48.390> chemistry<00:05:48.840> class<00:05:48.870> actually<00:05:49.350> if<00:05:49.680> you're<00:05:49.860> in

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
in chemistry class actually if you're in

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.610 
in chemistry class actually if you're in
a<00:05:50.400> really<00:05:50.580> desperate<00:05:51.060> situation<00:05:51.720> you<00:05:51.840> can<00:05:52.020> use

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
a really desperate situation you can use

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.680 
a really desperate situation you can use
a<00:05:52.650> Cheeto<00:05:53.010> as<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.340> firestarter<00:05:53.880> too<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:56.690> you

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
a Cheeto as a firestarter too so you

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.740 
a Cheeto as a firestarter too so you
might<00:05:58.020> need<00:05:58.170> matches<00:05:58.590> for<00:05:58.800> this<00:05:58.950> one<00:05:59.190> but<00:05:59.430> it

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
might need matches for this one but it

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.480 
might need matches for this one but it
will<00:06:00.750> get<00:06:00.930> lit<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.410> then<00:06:01.500> it'll<00:06:01.710> go<00:06:01.920> what<00:06:04.490> so

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
will get lit and then it'll go what so

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.510 
will get lit and then it'll go what so
yeah<00:06:07.940> chito<00:06:08.940> burns<00:06:09.240> pretty<00:06:10.230> good<00:06:10.410> too<00:06:10.620> and

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
yeah chito burns pretty good too and

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.510 
yeah chito burns pretty good too and
then<00:06:12.180> you<00:06:12.470> you<00:06:13.470> can<00:06:13.590> add<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.800> few<00:06:14.010> to<00:06:14.250> it<00:06:14.430> and

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
then you you can add a few to it and

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.750 
then you you can add a few to it and
have<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.550> Cheeto<00:06:17.970> fire<00:06:18.240> but<00:06:19.340> yep<00:06:20.340> that's<00:06:20.610> the

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
have a Cheeto fire but yep that's the

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.940 
have a Cheeto fire but yep that's the
spotter<00:06:21.000> starter<00:06:21.570> and<00:06:21.840> it'll<00:06:22.500> probably<00:06:22.710> burn

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
spotter starter and it'll probably burn

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.760 
spotter starter and it'll probably burn
it<00:06:23.100> for<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.250> good<00:06:23.370> 20<00:06:23.550> minutes<00:06:23.760> in<00:06:24.230> the<00:06:25.230> cheeto

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
it for a good 20 minutes in the cheeto

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.740 
it for a good 20 minutes in the cheeto
for<00:06:26.040> a<00:06:26.070> couple<00:06:26.400> minutes<00:06:26.520> but<00:06:26.940> definitely

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
for a couple minutes but definitely

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.540 
for a couple minutes but definitely
enough<00:06:27.990> to<00:06:28.140> get<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.500> fire<00:06:28.740> started<00:06:29.540> so
