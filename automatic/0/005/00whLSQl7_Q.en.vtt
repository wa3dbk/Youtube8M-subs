00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.630
 mosaic grinder m 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.150
 from floor 199 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.450
 mosaic floors is on 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.760
 today is the most 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.269
 short-lived and wear-resistant e 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.469
 use of natural stones and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.650
 flower garden cements 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.710
 allows you to achieve great 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.740
 aesthetically 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.269
 search for such coverage 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.699
 mosaic floors are often used in 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.099
 rooms with elevated 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.079
 requirements 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.319
 interior design 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.089
 in charts 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.429
 And so on 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.129
 mosaic floors are much cheaper than theirs 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.910
 short-lived competitors 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.940
 whereby 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.520
 I often use them 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.740
 in industrial premises 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.050
 production cuts 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.990
 mosaic floors 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.930
 which is observed recently 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.780
 explained firstly aggressive 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.440
 expansion to the market of all kinds of crazatz 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.720
 materials and secondly the myth 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.070
 high labor intensity of production 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.300
 let's get to know each other 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.490
 labor-intensive production and 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.100
 try to dispel this myth 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 so 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.770
 in front of us is a mosaic grinder with 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.640
 floor 199 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.580
 machine is designed to process 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 mosaic floors as well as for any floors 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.160
 from natural stone 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 stone and mosaic processing takes place with 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.010
 so safety requirements 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.330
 very high 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.980
 before starting work 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.170
 it is necessary to turn on the machine in the network 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 carefully check the protective disconnect 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.450
 devices 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.430
 he must check the machine 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.100
 idle 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.350
 for this the car should be tilted on 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 yourself and turn on the engine 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.170
 pushing a button 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.210
 after checking the car is necessary 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 install grinding stones 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.250
 encryption is done 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 triangular no abrasive 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.710
 segments 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.010
 set mid traverse 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.030
 in order to access 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.590
 rails 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.049
 the machine must be listed back and 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.890
 tilt all the way 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.030
 abrasive segments are inserted into 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 holders 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.250
 and shouts with special 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.840
 spring rings 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.870
 after installing the abrasive stones 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.110
 the car must be put into position 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.269
 on driving wheels 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.949
 before work but processed 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.969
 surface is recommended to pour 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.639
 water 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.939
 button 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.279
 you need to turn on the machine and you can 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:22.059
 get to work 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.849
 water in the process but 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.769
 processed 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.469
 the surface is fed through a special 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.449
 mounted next to the handle 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.159
 for optimal machine performance 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.869
 reported to different 100 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.050
 and in march for three 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.030
 provide uniform of but 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.969
 segments and the main work of the machine 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.309
 resistance to abrasive stones 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.569
 average resistance of a set of 12 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.899
 square meters 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.849
 turns off the car club to the roots 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.829
 after turning off the car is necessary 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.609
 turn off immediately June 20 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.039
 best machine performance 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.369
 can be achieved if instead of stones 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.659
 apply their brake slices 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.049
 cut diamond design 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.790
 represent a metal washer with 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.019
 diamond segments attached to it 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.980
 that and zao diamond at the ends of may 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.449
 intended for us 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.519
 krylov milling and grinding 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.519
 mosaic concrete slabs and floors 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.489
 use diamond express 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.900
 instead of abrasive stones allows 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.430
 significantly improve performance 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.459
 processing and durability 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.239
 average tire set 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.289
 150 square meters can be processed 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.039
 replace triangular abrasive segments 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.689
 for diamond face mills enough 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.479
 simply 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.859
 the car must be tilted until it stops in the sport 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.089
 providing 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.159
 the traverse mortar is then removed spring 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.579

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.089
 diamond cuts are set to 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.089
 special adapter satellites 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.629

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.009
 they are mounted on the machine 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.249
 departure abrasive into segments 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.499

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.439
 no different from working with stones 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.879
 to ensure the purity of the treated 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.109
