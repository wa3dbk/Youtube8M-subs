if you run set max players for youtube
and<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:21.070> updates<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.970> science<00:03:22.299> that's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
and it updates in the science that's

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.039 
and it updates in the science that's
pretty<00:03:22.630> cool

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
pretty cool

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.370 
pretty cool
so<00:03:23.829> um<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:26.230> floor<00:03:26.769> has<00:03:26.950> spawned<00:03:28.019> from<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.230> two

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
so um the floor has spawned from the two

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.680 
so um the floor has spawned from the two
points<00:03:29.769> which<00:03:29.980> we<00:03:30.250> set<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.269> set<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.630> above

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
points which we set so I set it above

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.190 
points which we set so I set it above
one<00:03:34.690> block<00:03:34.930> above<00:03:35.230> why<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.160> did<00:03:36.370> last<00:03:36.549> time<00:03:36.790> and

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
one block above why I did last time and

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.670 
one block above why I did last time and
it<00:03:38.200> starts<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.620> twenty<00:03:38.859> seconds<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:40.680> while

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
it starts in twenty seconds so while

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.060 
it starts in twenty seconds so while
we're<00:03:41.920> we're<00:03:42.340> waiting<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:44.709> requested

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
we're we're waiting this was requested

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.180 
we're we're waiting this was requested
by<00:03:45.600> some<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> comments<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.410> might<00:03:47.680> pop<00:03:48.160> up

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
by some of the comments I might pop up

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.750 
by some of the comments I might pop up
the<00:03:48.579> image<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.299> their<00:03:49.570> comment<00:03:50.579> but<00:03:51.579> I<00:03:51.609> was

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the image of their comment but I was

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.130 
the image of their comment but I was
thinking<00:03:51.910> maybe<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.540> could<00:03:52.660> do<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.320> server<00:03:55.140> sort

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
thinking maybe I could do a server sort

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.759 
thinking maybe I could do a server sort
of<00:03:56.290> showcase<00:03:56.680> each<00:03:57.630> tutorial<00:03:58.630> where<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.109> cut<00:03:59.739> up

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
of showcase each tutorial where I cut up

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.860 
of showcase each tutorial where I cut up
the<00:03:59.859> server<00:04:00.160> IP<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.000> go<00:04:01.209> check<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.540> out

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
the server IP you can go check it out

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.750 
the server IP you can go check it out
so<00:04:02.260> if<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.440> want<00:04:02.650> your<00:04:02.859> server<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.280> pop<00:04:03.459> up<00:04:03.609> in

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
so if you want your server to pop up in

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.319 
so if you want your server to pop up in
the<00:04:03.819> video<00:04:03.940> send<00:04:04.750> me<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> private<00:04:05.140> message<00:04:05.530> and

objective is not to fall down here see
ya<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.270> only<00:04:34.419> have<00:04:34.570> one<00:04:34.600> life<00:04:34.960> self<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.560> I've

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
ya I only have one life self that I've

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.719 
ya I only have one life self that I've
lost<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:38.320> am<00:04:38.530> in<00:04:38.710> spectator<00:04:39.220> mode<00:04:39.310> at<00:04:39.639> the

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
lost and I am in spectator mode at the

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.200 
lost and I am in spectator mode at the
moment<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.810> obviously<00:04:41.080> can't<00:04:41.440> break<00:04:41.650> blocks

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
moment so I obviously can't break blocks

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.260 
moment so I obviously can't break blocks
when<00:04:43.210> they<00:04:43.360> turn<00:04:43.660> orange<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.350> then<00:04:44.410> red<00:04:44.710> and

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
when they turn orange and then red and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.230 
when they turn orange and then red and
it<00:04:46.270> gets<00:04:46.419> harder<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:46.810> harder<00:04:46.870> until<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.940> have

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
it gets harder and harder until you have

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.409 
it gets harder and harder until you have
a<00:04:49.270> winner<00:04:49.690> so<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.349> can<00:04:50.440> do<00:04:50.500> PvP<00:04:51.130> are<00:04:51.340> new<00:04:51.970> and

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
a winner so you can do PvP are new and

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.170 
a winner so you can do PvP are new and
that<00:04:53.380> leaves<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.919> game<00:04:54.070> see<00:04:54.759> ya

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
that leaves the game see ya

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.110 
that leaves the game see ya
it's<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:56.050> very<00:04:56.289> very<00:04:56.380> cool<00:04:56.620> plugin<00:04:57.120> the
