00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
discoloration in general and this is a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.750 
discoloration in general and this is a
lot<00:00:47.100> cheaper<00:00:47.129> than<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.120> getting

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
because you can do this once a week so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
because you can do this once a week so
it's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:56.070> effective<00:00:56.520> once<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> week<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it's a bit more effective once a week so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's a bit more effective once a week so
4<00:00:57.750> times<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.020> month<00:00:58.340> rather<00:00:59.340> than<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
4 times a month rather than going to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.380 
4 times a month rather than going to
your<00:01:00.059> dermatologist<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.750> once<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> month<00:01:01.289> and
