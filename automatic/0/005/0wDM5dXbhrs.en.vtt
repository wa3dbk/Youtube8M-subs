different<00:01:17.860> differences<00:01:18.720> got<00:01:19.720> this<00:01:19.870> bolt<00:01:20.170> here

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
different differences got this bolt here

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.240 
different differences got this bolt here
it<00:01:20.590> come<00:01:20.770> out<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:22.650> come<00:01:23.650> out<00:01:23.830> of<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:23.979> natural

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.430 
Rustler shock tower has a little shank
and<00:01:27.190> mix<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.610> for<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.850> difference<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:29.020> has<00:01:29.080> the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
and mix it for the difference it has the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.060 
and mix it for the difference it has the
same<00:01:29.770> diameter<00:01:30.340> as<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.240> crankshaft<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
same diameter as the crankshaft on the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.450 
same diameter as the crankshaft on the
on<00:01:36.070> this<00:01:36.220> motor<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.860> you'll<00:01:39.100> need<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:39.310> a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
on this motor all you'll need is a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.109 
on this motor all you'll need is a
little<00:01:39.880> lock<00:01:40.270> washer<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.900> couple<00:01:41.080> shims<00:01:41.470> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
little lock washer and a couple shims to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.000 
little lock washer and a couple shims to
shim<00:01:43.119> out<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:44.310> clutch<00:01:45.310> bill<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:47.010> another

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
shim out the clutch bill and another

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.640 
shim out the clutch bill and another
little<00:01:48.310> difference<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:50.200> have<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.470> take

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
little difference is you have to take

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.340 
little difference is you have to take
the<00:01:50.890> net<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:52.030> track<00:01:52.270> system<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.750> next<00:01:53.229> slip

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
the net the track system that next slip

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.679 
the net the track system that next slip
flip<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.799> backwards<00:01:54.159> like<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:56.439> right<00:01:56.890> here

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
flip it backwards like this right here

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.950 
flip it backwards like this right here
against<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.840> flywheel<00:02:00.720> because<00:02:01.720> when<00:02:01.869> you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
against the flywheel because when you

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920 
against the flywheel because when you
stick<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.409> associated<00:02:03.130> clutch<00:02:03.909> shoes<00:02:04.689> on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
stick the associated clutch shoes on

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.249 
stick the associated clutch shoes on
there<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.470> springs<00:02:06.600> has<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:07.840> something

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
there the springs has to have something

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.130 
there the springs has to have something
to<00:02:08.349> rest<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:09.390> there<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.569> make<00:02:10.720> sure<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:10.990> get

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
to rest on there just make sure you get

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.580 
to rest on there just make sure you get
that<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.440> there<00:02:11.590> tight

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
that on there tight

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.550 
that on there tight
I<00:02:12.970> haven't<00:02:13.970> tried<00:02:14.120> using<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.629> Traxxas<00:02:15.080> clutch<00:02:15.319> I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I haven't tried using a Traxxas clutch I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.900 
I haven't tried using a Traxxas clutch I
don't<00:02:15.739> know<00:02:15.830> if<00:02:15.920> it'll<00:02:16.040> work<00:02:16.129> or<00:02:16.400> not<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:16.819> you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
don't know if it'll work or not but you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.080 
don't know if it'll work or not but you
can<00:02:17.060> try<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.090> got<00:02:20.420> hit<00:02:20.810> runs

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
can try but this is what I got hit runs

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.250 
can try but this is what I got hit runs
