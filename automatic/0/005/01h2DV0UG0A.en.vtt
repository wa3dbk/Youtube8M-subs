00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
now that's why we're doing the things

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.910 
now that's why we're doing the things
we're<00:00:12.509> doing<00:00:12.540> because<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.049> flexibility<00:00:13.769> he

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
we're doing because of flexibility he

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.169 
we're doing because of flexibility he
gives<00:00:14.160> us<00:00:14.309> well<00:00:14.460> Rex<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> same

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179

flexibility<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.379> know<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.740> think<00:00:16.980> both<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
flexibility you know so I think both of

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.010 
flexibility you know so I think both of
those<00:00:17.520> guys<00:00:17.730> embarrass<00:00:18.150> him<00:00:18.300> ray<00:00:18.810> would<00:00:18.960> you
