00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
equipped with caterpillar engine think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.950 
equipped with caterpillar engine think
we've<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> 435<00:00:26.430> horsepower<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
we've got a 435 horsepower this is a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.849 
we've got a 435 horsepower this is a
c-13

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
c-13

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.730 
c-13
so<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:29.970> smaller<00:00:30.289> displacement<00:00:31.289> but

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
so a little bit smaller displacement but

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.110 
so a little bit smaller displacement but
you're<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> sacrifice<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you're not going to sacrifice the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.910 
you're not going to sacrifice the
performance<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> horsepower<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> pulling

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
performance and horsepower and pulling

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
performance and horsepower and pulling
but<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> little<00:00:35.910> bit<00:00:36.000> lighter<00:00:36.270> weight<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
but it's a little bit lighter weight I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.170 
but it's a little bit lighter weight I
believe<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> c-13<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> probably<00:00:38.489> about<00:00:38.579> 600

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
believe the c-13 is probably about 600

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
believe the c-13 is probably about 600
pounds<00:00:39.270> lighter<00:00:39.629> than<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.930> seat<00:00:40.170> 15<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
pounds lighter than a seat 15 so you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
pounds lighter than a seat 15 so you
still<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> performance<00:00:42.690> still<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.710> good

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
still get the performance still get good

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.680 
still get the performance still get good
fuel<00:00:44.010> economy<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
fuel economy but you get it out of a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
fuel economy but you get it out of a
lighter<00:00:45.899> weight<00:00:46.170> engine<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.219> bit

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
lighter weight engine got a little bit

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.799 
lighter weight engine got a little bit
of<00:00:47.399> bling<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> truck<00:00:48.270> we've<00:00:48.480> got<00:00:48.600> some

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of bling on this truck we've got some

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.279 
of bling on this truck we've got some
aluminum<00:00:49.020> wheels<00:00:50.180> Wow<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.199> gonna

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
aluminum wheels Wow I think you're gonna

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.200 
aluminum wheels Wow I think you're gonna
like<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.739> side<00:00:53.039> mirrors<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.670> chrome

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like these side mirrors with chrome

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.700 
like these side mirrors with chrome
finish<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:56.719> got<00:00:57.719> dual<00:00:57.960> fuel<00:00:58.199> tanks

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
finish on it got dual fuel tanks

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.729 
finish on it got dual fuel tanks
underneath<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> cab<00:00:59.899> looks<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.350> are

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
underneath the cab looks like these are

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.399 
underneath the cab looks like these are
hundred<00:01:02.520> gallon<00:01:02.969> fuel<00:01:03.120> tanks<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.780> again<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
hundred gallon fuel tanks up again I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.310 
hundred gallon fuel tanks up again I
think<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.890> truck<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.400> probably<00:01:06.080> SPECT<00:01:07.080> with

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
think this truck was probably SPECT with

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
think this truck was probably SPECT with
the<00:01:07.439> intention<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.490> lighter

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the intention of a little bit lighter

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
the intention of a little bit lighter
weight<00:01:08.880> overall<00:01:09.570> lighter<00:01:09.930> chassis<00:01:10.229> weight

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
weight overall lighter chassis weight

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
weight overall lighter chassis weight
