00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.210
 hello I am with and this time I 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.090
 let's present what is the 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.540
 chilindrina we are going to use three boxes 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.970
 different from molds what is pop bet 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.699
 So- and- so and we start 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.390
 let's mark the face we will use 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.029
 foamy in flesh color in this mold 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.450
 we should precisely leave much more 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.210
 surplus so that we do not fall short 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.650
 then let's place the heat 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.650
 directly on the plate 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.690
 let's mark the shoes of the 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.660
 chilindrina and it's going to be white 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.750
 for the socks and in black for the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.110
 shoe are going to be two blank and two in 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 black 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.689
 the black one we are going to put first a 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 little heat to give it the shine 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.619
 from the top 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.380
 if you notice, I have the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.660
 another mold so that my 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.230
 way and we can do the thermos well 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.230
 formed 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.509
 to do the hair as we put 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.250
 a little bit warm from the foami color black 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.830
 we give the brightness from the front 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 We place directly on the iron the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.340
 foam and to be able to do well our 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.299
 thermoformed if you move the mold away 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.330
 of the heat and let it cool down is not going to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.799
 to be able to do well its formed and they go to 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.799
 feel that I do not frame them 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.940
 hands like we put a little bit to 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.599
 heat first to be able to put the brightness 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.599
 in the opposite 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.730
 Here is where you connect 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.730
 put upside down is not going to mark them 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.720
 and so we have our hands 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.220
 we already have the face we are going to use 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.099
 acrylic paint in white color for 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.829
 make it the bottom of the eye we will use the 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.960
 brush on the back so that it 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.520
 Give us a little more 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.590
 and paint it all white 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.170
 It can also be done with the bristles of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.990
 brush but how do they have the depth 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.480
 of the eye that's why I use the brush 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.210
 in the back since we have the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.770
 two eyes painted white we will use 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:16.560
 the black acrylic paint to make it 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.850
 the bottom of the mouth like we use the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.850
 back of the brush 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.230
 we let it dry we will be left with this 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:38.010
 way since we have it dry the part of 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.690
 below that is white we will use paint 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.690
 Acrylic in brown 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 it will stay like this, we let it dry 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.910
 and since we painted the outline in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.540
 black color let's put the background 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.540
 Of the eye 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.539
 in this way we will use the gises 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.139
 orange pastel to make the 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.139
 badges 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.330
 a brush with a little bit of cotton and 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.229
 let's first give a few little touches 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.229
 and in circles 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.720
 since we did this again we're going to 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.729
 use our paint in black 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.729
 and we are going to make the nuggets 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.259
 let it dry 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.080
 and already so the back the 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.659
 shape with my black color this sphere is 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.969
 of number 6 is the one that remains 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.370
 exactly in the face do not go to 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.889
 press inward because then 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.800
 would lose its way nothing else is in the 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:26.310
 contour and that's what goes 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.159
 now we are going to cut a little bit not to the 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.250
 ras nothing else let's cut a little 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:36.620
 the surplus to start 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.620
 place your face on the unicel ball 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.389
 there is no problem that does not fit them 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.330
 although not fit them correctly right to 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.220
 time they cut the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.400
 they cut it even more 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.740
 because we're going to cover that with a strip 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.150
 that we are going to cut out approximately 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.150
 one centimeter wide 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.780
 the tape that we will always place 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.780
 let's start at the bottom 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:38.460
 Now let's make the hair both 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.260
 colitas let's cut out the rectangles 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.820
 we cut heartfelt 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:49.210
 we put a white sheet of paper 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:52.180
 we have the iron at full temperature and 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.670
 We ironed to make the detail of the 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.670
 tips of pigtails 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:05.509
 since we did it we do two and we're going to 

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:05.509
 rolling to make the two pigtails 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.310
 we put a small detail in green 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.600
 because his costume of the chilindrina 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.600
 it's green smoke 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.730
 since we have these two we are going to 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:42.080
 foami cut a little to make the 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.080
 fringe of the chilindrina 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.080
 we put the heat 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:54.280
 This is to give you volume 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.280
 Reflection of the free chj 

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.300
 let's place this part we no longer 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.270
 is flat we are left with a bit of 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.740
 volume these little details these 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.620
 that you have to take care of so that 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.400
 this Wednesday the height of 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.860
 the pigtails is in the opposite 

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:18.110
 one has to be higher than the other 

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.110
 because he does not have couples
