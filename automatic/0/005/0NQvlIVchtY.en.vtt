kinda wasn't sunday it's half frozen
pretty<00:00:25.619> wet<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.920> top<00:00:27.080> it's<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.349> it's

pretty wet on top it's all right it's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.870 
pretty wet on top it's all right it's
hilly<00:00:28.800> man<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.460> surprisingly

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
hilly man it's actually surprisingly

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730 
hilly man it's actually surprisingly
it's<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> pretty<00:00:30.779> good<00:00:30.960> uphill<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.679> then

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it's like a pretty good uphill and then

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's like a pretty good uphill and then
you<00:00:31.949> descend<00:00:32.700> down<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> little<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.239> then<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you descend down a little bit then you

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.700 
you descend down a little bit then you
climb<00:00:33.630> back<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.320> there's<00:00:34.530> some

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
climb back up and then there's some

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.400 
climb back up and then there's some
pretty<00:00:35.610> sketchy<00:00:35.969> turns<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.320> really

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
pretty sketchy turns or you don't really

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.690 
pretty sketchy turns or you don't really
know<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> traction<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
know how good the traction is because it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540 
know how good the traction is because it
looks<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> softened<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> rose

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
looks kind of softened with this rose

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.799 
looks kind of softened with this rose
underneath<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.480> colder<00:00:42.780> i

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
underneath and it's like a colder i

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
underneath and it's like a colder i
think<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> freeze<00:00:43.379> again<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
think it's going to freeze again and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
think it's going to freeze again and
become<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:44.940> treacherous<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.629> few<00:00:46.620> times

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
become really treacherous a few times

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
become really treacherous a few times
off<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> bike<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.149> saw<00:00:48.480> two<00:00:48.539> sets<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
off the bike to a I saw two sets of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.430 
off the bike to a I saw two sets of
stairs<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.920> yeah<00:00:50.280> there's<00:00:51.000> well<00:00:51.329> there's

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
stairs and yeah there's well there's

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.240 
stairs and yeah there's well there's
three<00:00:52.440> sections<00:00:52.770> where<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.190> off

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
three sections where you have to get off

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
three sections where you have to get off
the<00:00:53.340> bike<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.030> who<00:00:54.239> knows<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the bike but then who knows that some of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
the bike but then who knows that some of
these<00:00:55.110> turns<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.699> know

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
these turns because it's you know

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
these turns because it's you know
they're<00:00:56.969> off<00:00:57.090> camber<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> they're<00:00:57.989> really

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
they're off camber and they're really

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
they're off camber and they're really
like<00:00:58.829> frozen<00:00:59.160> ruts<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> inside<00:00:59.850> that's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
like frozen ruts on the inside that's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.779 
like frozen ruts on the inside that's
off<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> outside<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
off so on the outside so so this is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
off so on the outside so so this is
going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> cut<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
going to cut this is going to be a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to cut this is going to be a
little<00:01:04.049> bit<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.409> Bend<00:01:04.710> we're<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> know

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
little bit like Bend we're like you know

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
little bit like Bend we're like you know
five<00:01:06.810> degrees<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> totally<00:01:07.950> change

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
five degrees is going to totally change

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
five degrees is going to totally change
the<00:01:08.490> course<00:01:08.790> yeah<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> mean<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the course yeah you think I mean it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.350 
the course yeah you think I mean it
could<00:01:10.890> either<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.159> ice<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> could<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:11.970> soft

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
could either be ice or it could be soft

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.640 
could either be ice or it could be soft
snow<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.810> could<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:12.960> much<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
snow or it could be much it's going to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.899 
snow or it could be much it's going to
be<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> supposed<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> snow<00:01:14.700> get

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
be it's kind of supposed to snow get

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
be it's kind of supposed to snow get
colder<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.990> pretty<00:01:16.200> nice<00:01:16.380> out

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
colder you know now it's pretty nice out

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350 
colder you know now it's pretty nice out
and<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.670> ride<00:01:17.850> everything<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.330> I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and it's you can ride everything but I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.700 
and it's you can ride everything but I
think<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.659> gets<00:01:18.810> colder<00:01:19.200> should<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> eat

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
think it gets colder should have to eat

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
think it gets colder should have to eat
a<00:01:19.740> lot<00:01:20.040> slicker<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.090> sure<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.509> guy's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a lot slicker and it's sure this guy's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.539 
a lot slicker and it's sure this guy's
racing<00:01:21.990> tomorrow<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.590> gonna<00:01:22.710> develop<00:01:23.220> ruts

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
racing tomorrow it's gonna develop ruts

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.770 
racing tomorrow it's gonna develop ruts
and<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> ruts<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> freeze<00:01:24.390> every<00:01:24.600> night

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and the ruts going to freeze every night

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.170 
and the ruts going to freeze every night
and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.020> might<00:01:25.200> thought<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
and then might thought a little bit so

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
and then might thought a little bit so
it's<00:01:27.180> gonna<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.360> hard<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.259> harder<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's gonna be hard to get harder and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.539 
it's gonna be hard to get harder and
harder<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> last<00:01:30.900> last<00:01:31.710> week<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> mulligan

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
harder so last last week was a mulligan

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.800 
harder so last last week was a mulligan
that<00:01:32.790> means<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.119> coming<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.659> this
