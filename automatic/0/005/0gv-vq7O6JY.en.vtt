then I got the other milk with all where

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.750 
then I got the other milk with all where
they<00:02:37.590> make<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.830> into<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.160> soup<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.670> I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
they make it into like a soup and I

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
they make it into like a soup and I
loved<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.709> was<00:02:40.830> very<00:02:41.099> different<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
loved it and so it was very different to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.120 
loved it and so it was very different to

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
think that I learned was um I think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.430 
think that I learned was um I think
feijoada<00:03:16.350> was<00:03:16.620> probably<00:03:16.920> my<00:03:17.069> favorite<00:03:18.440> but

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
feijoada was probably my favorite but

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.460 
feijoada was probably my favorite but
what<00:03:19.590> was<00:03:19.739> interesting<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.340> there<00:03:21.470> if

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
what was interesting is that there if

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.759 
what was interesting is that there if
you<00:03:22.819> offer<00:03:23.819> someone<00:03:24.359> in<00:03:24.569> egg<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> fried

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
you offer someone in egg like a fried

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.339 
you offer someone in egg like a fried
egg<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:27.090> were<00:03:27.180> calling<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.630> person<00:03:27.810> poor

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
egg you were calling that person poor

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.650 
egg you were calling that person poor
because<00:03:29.010> eggs<00:03:29.280> down<00:03:29.609> there<00:03:29.880> are<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.510> only

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
because eggs down there are for only

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.830 
because eggs down there are for only
poor<00:03:31.139> people<00:03:31.170> they're<00:03:32.130> very<00:03:32.370> cheap<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.720> if

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
poor people they're very cheap and so if
