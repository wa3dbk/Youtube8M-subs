in 2006 that our failure to qualify
would<00:04:58.709> be<00:04:58.829> a<00:04:58.860> big<00:04:59.279> blow<00:04:59.579> to<00:04:59.610> Asian<00:05:00.119> football

would be a big blow to Asian football

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.539 
would be a big blow to Asian football
because<00:05:01.229> our<00:05:01.379> team<00:05:01.619> can<00:05:01.919> compete<00:05:02.159> under
