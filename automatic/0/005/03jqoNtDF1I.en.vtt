to go to the tip and you're going to
make<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.110> small<00:01:12.530> loop<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.630> further<00:01:14.899> your

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
make a small loop so the further your

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.420 
make a small loop so the further your
wire<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.880> tip<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:18.140> smaller<00:01:18.470> your<00:01:19.220> loop

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
wire is to the tip the smaller your loop

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.910 
wire is to the tip the smaller your loop
is<00:01:19.610> going<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:20.259> you're<00:01:21.259> going<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.439> take<00:01:21.680> that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
is going to be you're going to take that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.260 
is going to be you're going to take that
and<00:01:22.159> just<00:01:22.610> roll<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.450> right<00:01:23.840> around<00:01:25.149> until<00:01:26.149> it

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and just roll that right around until it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.059 
and just roll that right around until it
meets<00:01:30.460> just<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.590> now<00:01:33.590> what<00:01:33.799> you're<00:01:33.890> going

to do is you're going to take your dowel

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.480 
to do is you're going to take your dowel
or<00:01:36.740> mandrel<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.770> you're<00:01:39.770> going<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:39.979> take<00:01:40.220> that

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
or mandrel and you're going to take that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.699 
or mandrel and you're going to take that
loop<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:44.259> you're<00:01:45.259> going<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.470> hold<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.920> and

and<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:07.910> what<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.210> can<00:02:08.240> do<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.750> take

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
and now what you can do is you can take

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.000 
and now what you can do is you can take
your<00:02:09.770> chain<00:02:09.979> nose<00:02:10.039> pliers<00:02:10.460> at<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.850> end<00:02:11.030> and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
your chain nose pliers at the end and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.400 
your chain nose pliers at the end and
slightly<00:02:13.010> bend<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> tip<00:02:18.280> just<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:19.490> that<00:02:20.410> now

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
slightly bend the tip just like that now

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.080 
slightly bend the tip just like that now
this<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:22.070> basic<00:02:22.520> you're<00:02:22.820> wearing

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
this is just a basic you're wearing

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.340 
you're going to do the same thing for
the<00:02:25.300> opposite<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.990> you're<00:02:27.080> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.260> take

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
the opposite so you're going to take

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.950 
the opposite so you're going to take
that<00:02:27.620> at<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> tip<00:02:28.330> just<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.720> and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
that at the tip just like that and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.460 
that at the tip just like that and
you're<00:02:30.740> going<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.950> roll<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:32.080> make<00:02:33.080> sure<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.290> can

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
you're going to roll it make sure I can

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
you're going to roll it make sure I can
stay<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> camera<00:02:34.190> view<00:02:34.220> here<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.150> bad

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
stay in the camera view here have a bad

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.400 
stay in the camera view here have a bad
habit<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.930> getting<00:02:36.110> out<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.590> camera<00:02:36.860> view<00:02:37.220> and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
habit of getting out of camera view and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.050 
habit of getting out of camera view and
take<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.590> around<00:02:39.890> until<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.400> meets<00:02:40.640> the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
take that around until it meets the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.510 
take that around until it meets the
other<00:02:41.209> side<00:02:41.770> then<00:02:42.770> you're<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.220> take<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
other side then you're going to take the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.760 
other side then you're going to take the
dowel<00:02:46.810> you're<00:02:47.810> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.989> lay<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.350> there

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
dowel you're going to lay that on there

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.290 
dowel you're going to lay that on there
with<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.610> loop<00:02:49.790> side<00:02:50.120> up<00:02:50.420> again<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.940> you're

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
with the loop side up again and you're

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.950 
with the loop side up again and you're
going<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.480> bend<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.930> around<00:02:55.150> just<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.300> so

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
going to bend that around just like so

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.920 
going to bend that around just like so
now<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:58.710> practice<00:02:59.160> you'll<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.370> able<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.930> do

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
now with practice you'll be able to do

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.830 
now with practice you'll be able to do
this<00:03:01.110> with<00:03:01.700> both<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.760> these<00:03:03.030> at<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.330> same<00:03:03.570> time

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
this with both of these at the same time

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.260 
this with both of these at the same time
and<00:03:04.140> you're<00:03:05.100> going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.250> try<00:03:05.550> your<00:03:06.000> best<00:03:06.120> to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
and you're going to try your best to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.960 
and you're going to try your best to
keep<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.290> loop<00:03:07.470> about<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.830> same<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
keep the loop about the same and at the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.790 
keep the loop about the same and at the
end<00:03:09.000> you're<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.990> bend<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.440> just

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
end you're just going to bend it up just

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.790 
end you're just going to bend it up just
a<00:03:10.950> hair<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.780> one<00:03:15.960> looks<00:03:16.080> like<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.440> needs<00:03:16.470> to

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
a hair this one looks like it needs to

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.520 
a hair this one looks like it needs to
be<00:03:16.860> round<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.340> just<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.970> hair<00:03:18.540> more

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.750 

just<00:03:25.250> like<00:03:25.520> so

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.140 

now<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.390> have<00:03:32.689> a<00:03:32.720> set

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
now you have a set

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.670 
now you have a set
of<00:03:34.659> basic<00:03:35.260> earwires

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.800
