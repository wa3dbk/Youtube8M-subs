00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.690 
Dickinson's um Tony witch hazel told her
so<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> decided<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.069> try<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.310> one<00:02:25.580> out

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
so I decided to just try this one out

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
so I decided to just try this one out
and<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.720> three<00:02:26.930> dollars<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
and this is like three dollars and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.759 
and this is like three dollars and
really<00:02:28.430> they're<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.239> same<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.680> only

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
really they're the same and the only

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.289 
really they're the same and the only
difference<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.310> like<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.549> price<00:02:31.760> tag<00:02:32.030> because

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299
