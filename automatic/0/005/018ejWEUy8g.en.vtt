that but that is an option so you may

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.960 
that but that is an option so you may
have<00:03:20.650> noticed<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.130> started<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.790> left

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
have noticed that I started on the left

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.170 
have noticed that I started on the left
side<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.420> head<00:03:22.600> that's<00:03:23.260> actually<00:03:24.180> just

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
side of the head that's actually just

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.220 
side of the head that's actually just
where<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.510> naturally<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.590> first<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:29.019> can

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
where I naturally go to first you can

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.890 
where I naturally go to first you can
start<00:03:29.410> on<00:03:29.829> any<00:03:30.670> side<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.480> head<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.750> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
start on any side of the head that you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.610 
start on any side of the head that you
want<00:03:32.370> whatever's<00:03:33.370> comfortable<00:03:33.989> for<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.170> I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
want whatever's comfortable for you I

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.620 
want whatever's comfortable for you I
could<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.430> done<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.670> same<00:03:36.850> cut<00:03:37.090> starting<00:03:37.540> on

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
could have done the same cut starting on

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.030 
could have done the same cut starting on
the<00:03:37.720> right<00:03:37.840> side<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.940> think<00:03:39.940> generally<00:03:40.690> if<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
the right side I think generally if the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.000 
the right side I think generally if the
hair<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.670> side<00:03:43.030> part<00:03:43.329> it's<00:03:44.320> easier<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.799> start

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
hair is a side part it's easier to start

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.759 
hair is a side part it's easier to start
on<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:46.000> side<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.269> has<00:03:46.510> less<00:03:46.959> hair<00:03:47.170> moving

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
on the side that has less hair moving

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.740 
on the side that has less hair moving
around<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.400> side<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.850> has<00:03:48.970> more<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:49.690> if

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
around to the side that has more but if

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.710 
around to the side that has more but if
it's<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.930> middle<00:03:50.230> part<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:52.269> can<00:03:52.420> start<00:03:52.660> on

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
it's a middle part you can start on

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.390 
it's a middle part you can start on
either<00:03:52.870> side<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.470> easily<00:03:54.040> get<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.220> nice

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
either side and easily get a nice

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.630 
either side and easily get a nice
balanced<00:03:54.940> look<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:57.100> now<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:57.310> you're<00:03:57.519> done

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.580 
balanced look so now that you're done
