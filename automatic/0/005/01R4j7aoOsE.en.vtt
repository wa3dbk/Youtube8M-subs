00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.380 

so<00:00:05.040> I'm<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.400> show<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.609> how<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.000> work

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
so I'm going to show you how to work

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.200 
so I'm going to show you how to work
decreases<00:00:07.049> on<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> circular<00:00:07.799> needle<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.970> thing

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
decreases on a circular needle the thing

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.209 
decreases on a circular needle the thing
to<00:00:09.360> remember<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:10.170> there<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.530> no<00:00:10.830> edge

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
to remember is that there is no edge

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.919 
to remember is that there is no edge
right<00:00:12.030> because<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:12.420> we're<00:00:12.570> knitting<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
right because if we're knitting in the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.930 
right because if we're knitting in the
round<00:00:13.019> there's<00:00:13.590> no<00:00:13.740> right<00:00:14.009> edge<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.490> left<00:00:14.730> edge

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
round there's no right edge or left edge

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.779 
round there's no right edge or left edge
to<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.630> balance<00:00:16.020> decreases<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.789> but

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to have to balance decreases on but

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.460 
to have to balance decreases on but
there<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> few<00:00:18.510> different<00:00:18.869> ways<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.380> doing

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
there are a few different ways of doing

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950 
there are a few different ways of doing
decreases<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.910> all<00:00:21.119> pattern

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
decreases and this is all pattern

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.170 
decreases and this is all pattern
dependent<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.680> garment<00:00:23.189> dependent<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.090> I'll

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
dependent and garment dependent so I'll

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.599 
dependent and garment dependent so I'll
show<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.930> few<00:00:25.410> different<00:00:25.439> ways<00:00:26.310> of

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
show you a few different ways of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.509 
show you a few different ways of
arranging<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:27.240> decreases<00:00:28.039> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> hat

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
arranging your decreases this is a hat

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.330 
arranging your decreases this is a hat
that<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> knit<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.210> round<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.470> 16<00:00:32.189> inch

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that I knit in the round on a 16 inch

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.250 
that I knit in the round on a 16 inch
circular<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> knit<00:00:33.600> around<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.200> around

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
circular so I knit around and around

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
circular so I knit around and around
with<00:00:34.590> knit<00:00:34.860> 2<00:00:35.040> purl<00:00:35.070> 2<00:00:35.340> ribbing<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with knit 2 purl 2 ribbing and then I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
with knit 2 purl 2 ribbing and then I
knit<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> long<00:00:37.020> section<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.770> straight

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
knit a long section of straight

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.700 
knit a long section of straight
stockinette<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> top<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
stockinette and when I got to the top it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
stockinette and when I got to the top it
was<00:00:40.800> time<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> start<00:00:41.370> decreasing<00:00:42.260> evenly<00:00:43.260> in

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
was time to start decreasing evenly in

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
was time to start decreasing evenly in
my<00:00:44.040> round<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> took<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> number<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
my round so I took the number of

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.700 
my round so I took the number of
stitches<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.500> had<00:00:46.800> around<00:00:47.300> divided<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> by

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
stitches that I had around divided it by

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
stitches that I had around divided it by
however<00:00:49.710> many<00:00:50.360> whatever<00:00:51.360> number<00:00:51.750> seemed<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
however many whatever number seemed to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.709 
however many whatever number seemed to
fit<00:00:52.320> evenly<00:00:52.829> into<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.090> did<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
fit evenly into there and I just did a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.770 
fit evenly into there and I just did a
decrease<00:00:56.390> every<00:00:58.219> inch<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.480> looks

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
decrease every inch or so or that looks

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.889 
decrease every inch or so or that looks
like<00:01:00.930> every<00:01:01.170> 1/2<00:01:01.379> inch<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:03.570> made

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
like every 1/2 inch or so and that made

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.350 
like every 1/2 inch or so and that made
even<00:01:04.350> decreases<00:01:04.860> around<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> top<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.210> that's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
even decreases around the top and that's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
even decreases around the top and that's
to<00:01:06.600> bring<00:01:06.840> together<00:01:07.080> things<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.189> sort<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> like

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to bring together things in sort of like

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
to bring together things in sort of like
concentric<00:01:09.990> circles<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.189> size<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.670> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
concentric circles the size of your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420 
concentric circles the size of your
round<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.960> also<00:01:13.140> stack<00:01:13.830> them<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.130> make

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
round you can also stack them and make

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
round you can also stack them and make
them<00:01:14.580> directional<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> top<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
them directional like the top of this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.780 
them directional like the top of this
mitten<00:01:17.900> this<00:01:18.900> has<00:01:19.170> left-leaning<00:01:19.979> decreases

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
mitten this has left-leaning decreases

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
mitten this has left-leaning decreases
on<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.180> side<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.869> stacked<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.500> every

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
on one side that are stacked up every

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
on one side that are stacked up every
other<00:01:23.009> round<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.270> has<00:01:24.509> right-leaning

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
other round and this has right-leaning

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
other round and this has right-leaning
decreases<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.369> side<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:26.939> stacked

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
decreases on this side that are stacked

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.170 
decreases on this side that are stacked
up<00:01:27.420> every<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:27.960> round<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.549> makes<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
up every other round and that makes a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260 
up every other round and that makes a
directional<00:01:30.960> decrease<00:01:31.640> that's<00:01:32.640> repeated<00:01:33.150> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
directional decrease that's repeated on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.600 
directional decrease that's repeated on
this<00:01:33.570> side<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> mitten<00:01:34.380> left<00:01:35.369> leading

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this side of the mitten left leading

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
this side of the mitten left leading
decreases<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.630> leading<00:01:36.869> decreases

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
decreases and right leading decreases

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.440 
decreases and right leading decreases
and<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.460> don't<00:01:39.000> work<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and you actually don't work the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
and you actually don't work the
decreases<00:01:39.960> any<00:01:40.140> differently<00:01:40.560> than<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.890> would

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
decreases any differently than you would

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
decreases any differently than you would
on<00:01:41.100> straight<00:01:41.549> needles<00:01:41.720> except<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> remember

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
on straight needles except to remember

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.130 
on straight needles except to remember
that<00:01:43.710> there's<00:01:44.310> no<00:01:44.520> beginning<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.479> end<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that there's no beginning or end of the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.340 
that there's no beginning or end of the
sides<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.560> your<00:01:46.619> project<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
sides of your project here you just have

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
sides of your project here you just have
a<00:01:49.950> round<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.700> goes<00:01:50.850> around<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> around<00:01:51.299> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
a round that goes around and around so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
a round that goes around and around so
I'll<00:01:52.320> show<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.619> my<00:01:53.159> favorite<00:01:53.520> ways<00:01:53.729> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
I'll show you my favorite ways of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.630 
I'll show you my favorite ways of
decreasing<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.920> favorite<00:01:56.280> right

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
decreasing this is my favorite right

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
decreasing this is my favorite right
leaning<00:01:57.030> decrease<00:01:57.380> I'll<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> couple<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
leaning decrease I'll do a couple of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.679 
leaning decrease I'll do a couple of
them<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.060> knit<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.450> together

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.309 

and<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.829> makes<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.249> stitches<00:02:04.929> on<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.109> left

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
and that makes the stitches on the left

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.989 
and that makes the stitches on the left
eat<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.829> ones<00:02:07.009> on<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.310> right<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.789> kind<00:02:07.939> of

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
eat the ones on the right so it kind of

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.509 
eat the ones on the right so it kind of
leans<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.750> right<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.259> then<00:02:10.009> there's<00:02:10.429> a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
leans to the right and then there's a

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.619 
leans to the right and then there's a
few<00:02:10.700> different<00:02:11.000> ways<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.239> working<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
few different ways of working a

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.080 
few different ways of working a
left-leaning<00:02:11.989> decrease<00:02:12.310> one<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.549> slip<00:02:13.940> slip

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
left-leaning decrease one is a slip slip

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.509 
left-leaning decrease one is a slip slip
knit<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:15.049> I'm<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.379> slip<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:16.010> stitch<00:02:16.069> as<00:02:16.489> if

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
knit so I'm going to slip a stitch as if

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.150 
knit so I'm going to slip a stitch as if
to<00:02:16.670> knit<00:02:16.819> slip<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.959> stitch<00:02:18.019> as<00:02:18.349> if<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.500> purl<00:02:18.620> and

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
to knit slip a stitch as if to purl and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.800 
to knit slip a stitch as if to purl and
then<00:02:19.760> I'm<00:02:19.849> going<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.060> knit<00:02:20.269> them<00:02:20.420> through<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
then I'm going to knit them through the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.460 
then I'm going to knit them through the
back<00:02:20.959> loop<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:23.690> makes<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.140> left-leaning

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
back loop this makes a left-leaning

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.110 
back loop this makes a left-leaning
decrease<00:02:24.739> where<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.459> stitch<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.940> right

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
decrease where the stitch on the right

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.729 
decrease where the stitch on the right
is<00:02:26.360> eating<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.810> stitch<00:02:27.019> on<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> left

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
is eating the stitch on the left

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.770 
is eating the stitch on the left
therefore<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.340> leans<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> left<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.239> then

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
therefore it leans to the left and then

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
therefore it leans to the left and then
you<00:02:29.900> can<00:02:30.049> also<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.440> knit<00:02:31.430> two<00:02:31.640> together

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
you can also just knit two together

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.050 
you can also just knit two together
through<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.569> back<00:02:32.599> loop<00:02:36.579> which<00:02:37.579> does<00:02:37.879> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
through the back loop which does the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.819 
through the back loop which does the
same<00:02:38.239> thing<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:38.780> gives<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.290> slightly

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
same thing but gives you a slightly

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.400 
same thing but gives you a slightly
different<00:02:40.069> look<00:02:40.400> here<00:02:40.849> you<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.209> see<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
different look here you can see that the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.410 
different look here you can see that the
stitch<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.680> sits<00:02:43.069> on<00:02:43.220> top<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.670> crossed<00:02:44.150> at

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
stitch that sits on top is crossed at

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.259 
stitch that sits on top is crossed at
the<00:02:44.510> bottom<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:45.370> opposed<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.519> slip<00:02:47.000> slip<00:02:47.209> knit

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
the bottom as opposed to slip slip knit

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.289 
the bottom as opposed to slip slip knit
where<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:47.900> open<00:02:48.230> at<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.410> bottom<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.299> if

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
where it's open at the bottom and if

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.020 
where it's open at the bottom and if
you'd<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.780> see<00:02:51.459> exactly<00:02:52.459> how<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.760> do

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
you'd like to see exactly how to do

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.729 
you'd like to see exactly how to do
those<00:02:53.239> decreases<00:02:53.959> they<00:02:54.319> are<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.650> another

video on right leading decreases and
left-leaning<00:02:57.560> decreases<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:58.940> don't

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
left-leaning decreases but you don't

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.520 
left-leaning decreases but you don't
have<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.359> work<00:02:59.480> them<00:02:59.660> any<00:02:59.840> differently<00:03:00.260> when

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
have to work them any differently when

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.990 
have to work them any differently when
you're<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.859> round<00:03:01.069> than<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.730> do<00:03:01.879> when

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
you're in the round than you do when

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.610 
you're in the round than you do when
you're<00:03:02.180> knitting<00:03:02.329> flat

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
you're knitting flat
