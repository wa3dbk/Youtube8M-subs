 16 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.859
 so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.880
 that this 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.710
 CR 63 in Digital Piano top class but he still has a few Kaba 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.850
 built-in special innovation that is completely new for us 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.020
 fresh trade 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.330
 but also the ability to usb-stick mp3 and veith as record and 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.590
 play 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.050
 especially the keyboard but this is the thanks 3 border pasta 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.670
 trip 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 this is a full keyboard made of plastic no plastic keys known walk beams 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.330
 Mechanism of about both always for the perfect balance 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.070
 and brand new the a record strobo area that is slightly roughened 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.280
 Surface the moisture absorbs ivory imitated by that I have 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 always the right grip 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 a very fast EBIT i develop and units very expressive 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 Dr 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 Dr 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.160
 he is a superb expressive keyboard as well 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.720
 the sound is true that's the whole new one 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 Sample by Kavai they have the pics in big grand pianos 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.720
 recorded and sound by sound 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.200
 integrated into this instrument that is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.839
 I get a really big concert grand piano 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.950
 at least the Saudis grand piano 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.080
 home with these little ones like the deed but of course I have too 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.180
 several women at your disposal not only piano for another direction 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.359
 to strike like for example 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.679
 an e-piano 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.229

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
 pte 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.680
 I also have great opportunities to combine songs for 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.439
 Example is stupid boat can reveal through observations what is below 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.439
 for example what and piano 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.799
 and of course I can do it too 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.799
 combined with bottle piano strings 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.519
 a great innovation in the ZIA 63 is the possibility 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.099
 to take on good to thick and not only Midi if and only that is 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.149
 that in the new mp3 files and aubry case 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.479
 Medi if not use around those in a sequel, for example 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.749
 seduce computer to further edit 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:09.569
 stamp out wrong notes 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.439
 mp3 files I can send by e-mail to friends u11 burn as a CD and 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.870
 if the whole thing attracts the players to recruit 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.959
 vice versa, of course, that works the same way that means if I am with the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.789
 Example Clarification Goal is buy 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.569
 I can put this on the usb-stick and of course I can play there 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.490
 Also to the game I was myself recorded around with myself 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.319
 playing with four hands is quite easy by moving to record 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.319
 and record something 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 act 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.450
 the whole is then stored on the usb-stick 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.450
 and then it's easy to play again 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.349
 I think that the 63 convinced all along the line 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.770
 I have a precise keyboard an authentic sound and bollards new 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.879
