you

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.640 

hello<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.040> welcome<00:00:11.160> back<00:00:11.720> to<00:00:12.720> this

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
hello there and welcome back to this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.300 
hello there and welcome back to this
YouTube<00:00:14.130> channel<00:00:14.160> thing<00:00:15.800> you<00:00:16.800> tuned<00:00:17.130> in

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
YouTube channel thing you tuned in

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.680 
YouTube channel thing you tuned in
because<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.700> wanted<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> learn<00:00:18.390> more<00:00:18.450> about

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
because you wanted to learn more about

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.320 
because you wanted to learn more about
Maju<00:00:19.290> shape<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.310> my<00:00:20.610> fancy<00:00:21.060> way<00:00:21.300> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
Maju shape which is my fancy way of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.909 
Maju shape which is my fancy way of
describing<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.860> controls<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:25.050> make

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
describing all of the controls that make

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.070 
describing all of the controls that make
up<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.160> control<00:00:26.790> of<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.270> vibrato<00:00:27.720> wave

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
up that control of your vibrato wave

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.240 
up that control of your vibrato wave
shape<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.599> really<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.930> gives

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
shape and I really think this gives

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.730 
shape and I really think this gives
unprecedented<00:00:32.250> control<00:00:32.430> over<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.390> this

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
unprecedented control over over this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.240 
unprecedented control over over this
analog<00:00:34.740> circuit<00:00:36.140> right<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> really

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
analog circuit right now I have a really

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.020 
analog circuit right now I have a really
symmetrical<00:00:39.120> sine<00:00:39.840> wave<00:00:40.580> dialed<00:00:41.580> in<00:00:43.790> and<00:00:44.790> here

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
symmetrical sine wave dialed in and here

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.780 
symmetrical sine wave dialed in and here
that<00:00:45.150> it's<00:00:45.920> same<00:00:46.920> amount<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> time<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
that it's same amount of time at the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.010 
that it's same amount of time at the
beginning<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.620> wave<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> end<00:00:51.020> if

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
beginning of the wave and at the end if

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.230 
beginning of the wave and at the end if
I<00:00:52.140> change<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.800> triangle<00:00:53.490> on<00:00:53.730> both<00:00:53.940> sides

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
I change this to triangle on both sides

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.760 
I change this to triangle on both sides
you'll<00:00:54.540> get<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> very<00:00:54.960> subtle<00:00:55.320> difference

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.750 

especially<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> speed<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.610> can

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
especially when you speed it up you can

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.570 
especially when you speed it up you can
hear<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:01.830> of<00:01:01.860> like<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
hear it it's kind of like that just that

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.570 
hear it it's kind of like that just that
straight

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
straight

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.780 
straight
ping-pong<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> thing<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.860> what's

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
ping-pong kind of a thing and what's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
ping-pong kind of a thing and what's
really<00:01:09.000> cool<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.560> can

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really cool about this is that you can

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
really cool about this is that you can
change<00:01:12.259> either<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.950> front<00:01:14.490> side<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
change either the the front side or the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
change either the the front side or the
back<00:01:16.020> side<00:01:16.320> shape<00:01:16.679> so<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.070> say<00:01:17.219> we<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.609> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
back side shape so let's say we want to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
back side shape so let's say we want to
do<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> square<00:01:18.359> wave<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.929> back<00:01:19.109> end<00:01:19.409> I'm

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
do a square wave on the back end I'm

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
do a square wave on the back end I'm
going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.340> move<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> warp<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.299> bit

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
going to just move the warp a little bit

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.020 
going to just move the warp a little bit
to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:24.450> got

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
to the right you got

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.789 
to the right you got
we<00:01:26.540> got<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.960> triangle<00:01:27.530> at<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.650> beginning

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
we got that triangle at the beginning

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.190 
we got that triangle at the beginning
and<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:30.340> cutting<00:01:31.180> off<00:01:31.359> with<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.899> square

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and it's cutting off with that square

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.679 
and it's cutting off with that square
wave<00:01:32.409> action<00:01:32.829> at<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> end<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.969> know<00:01:34.090> I'll<00:01:34.539> do

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
wave action at the end you know I'll do

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.830 
wave action at the end you know I'll do
all<00:01:34.869> sorts<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.229> rhythmic<00:01:35.710> things<00:01:35.950> like<00:01:36.189> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
all sorts of rhythmic things like that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600 
all sorts of rhythmic things like that
just<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.960> give<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.289> better<00:01:38.649> idea<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
just to give you a better idea of the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.039 
just to give you a better idea of the
warp<00:01:40.000> knob<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.549> know<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:42.819> right<00:01:43.030> now<00:01:43.299> that

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
warp knob you know so right now that

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.000 
warp knob you know so right now that
square<00:01:44.439> waves<00:01:44.619> at<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.950> end<00:01:45.039> of<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.189> wave

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
square waves at the end of the wave

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.440 
square waves at the end of the wave
dial<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.450> left<00:01:49.970> now<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.120> more<00:01:51.360> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
dial that to the left now it's more in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.230 
dial that to the left now it's more in
the<00:01:51.540> middle<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.190> be<00:01:53.430> very<00:01:53.700> abrupt

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the middle and it's gonna be very abrupt

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.149 
the middle and it's gonna be very abrupt
at<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> left<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.290> setting

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.020 

and<00:02:01.470> can<00:02:02.470> just<00:02:02.680> do<00:02:02.860> all<00:02:03.100> sorts<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.759> weirdness

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and can just do all sorts of weirdness

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.859 
and can just do all sorts of weirdness
with<00:02:04.330> this

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.190 

sine<00:02:09.869> wave<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> sine<00:02:12.810> wave<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
sine wave here this is sine wave in

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.199 
sine wave here this is sine wave in
triangle<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.790> smooth

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
triangle so you get that kind of smooth

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.290 
triangle so you get that kind of smooth
sine<00:02:15.569> wave<00:02:16.310> at<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.520> end<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
sine wave at the end and then that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.250 
sine wave at the end and then that
triangle<00:02:18.990> action<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> beginning<00:02:21.260> turn

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
triangle action at the beginning turn

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.550 
triangle action at the beginning turn
the<00:02:22.380> depth<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.830> way<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:27.230> that's<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.380> little

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the depth all the way up that's a little

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.220 
the depth all the way up that's a little
too<00:02:28.680> weird<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:28.980> me<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.489> some<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.880> kids

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
too weird for me but some of you kids

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.140 
too weird for me but some of you kids
might<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.260> into<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
might be into it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.850 
might be into it
so<00:02:33.150> yeah<00:02:33.360> that's<00:02:33.540> pretty<00:02:33.660> much<00:02:34.080> magis<00:02:34.650> shape

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
so yeah that's pretty much magis shape

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.050 
so yeah that's pretty much magis shape
so<00:02:35.569> thanks<00:02:36.569> for<00:02:36.720> listening<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:38.060> watch

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
so thanks for listening and watch

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.310 
so thanks for listening and watch
another<00:02:39.300> video<00:02:39.660> because<00:02:39.780> we're<00:02:39.989> gonna<00:02:40.080> get

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
