today<00:00:04.740> we're<00:00:04.920> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.130> carry<00:00:05.339> out<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
today we're going to carry out the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.330 
today we're going to carry out the
experiment<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> isolate<00:00:07.259> DNA<00:00:07.770> from<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
experiment how to isolate DNA from a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:33.680 
experiment how to isolate DNA from a
plant<00:00:08.580> tissue<00:00:08.910> extract

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.370 

the<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.440> first<00:00:34.740> step<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.880> chop<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> onion

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the very first step is to chop the onion

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.690 
the very first step is to chop the onion
into<00:00:37.560> small<00:00:37.740> pieces

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
into small pieces

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.850 
into small pieces
this<00:00:39.330> increases<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.870> surface<00:00:40.170> area<00:00:40.470> of<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this increases the surface area of the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.720 
this increases the surface area of the
onion<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:43.590> prepare<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> mixture<00:00:44.310> of

he then placed the mixture in a blender
in<00:02:49.000> order<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.599> break<00:02:49.810> down<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.290> cell<00:02:50.500> walls

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
in order to break down the cell walls

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.559 
in order to break down the cell walls
it<00:02:53.319> isn't<00:02:53.590> very<00:02:53.769> important<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.269> do<00:02:55.450> not

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
it isn't very important that you do not

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.869 
it isn't very important that you do not
blend<00:02:55.870> any<00:02:56.319> longer<00:02:56.739> than<00:02:56.920> three<00:02:57.129> seconds<00:02:57.609> as

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
blend any longer than three seconds as

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.839 
blend any longer than three seconds as
the<00:02:58.510> DNA<00:02:58.750> DNA<00:02:59.260> itself<00:02:59.889> may<00:03:00.189> be<00:03:00.219> broken<00:03:00.549> down

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
the DNA DNA itself may be broken down

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:10.349 
the DNA DNA itself may be broken down
you<00:03:07.139> then<00:03:08.139> filter<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.010> mixture<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:10.090> remove

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
you then filter the mixture to remove

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.170 
you then filter the mixture to remove
any<00:03:10.599> other<00:03:10.840> cell<00:03:11.200> parts<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.609> your<00:03:12.730> filtrate

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
any other cell parts so your filtrate

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:37.230 
any other cell parts so your filtrate
now<00:03:13.359> contains<00:03:13.810> only<00:03:14.200> DNA<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.010> proteins

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.590 

place<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.200> sample<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.830> your<00:03:39.070> fill<00:03:39.310> trace<00:03:39.640> into

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
place the sample of your fill trace into

00:03:40.600 --> 00:04:07.980 
place the sample of your fill trace into
a<00:03:40.630> boiling<00:03:40.930> tube

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.740 

to<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.220> will<00:04:09.340> add<00:04:09.490> three<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.180> four<00:04:10.390> drops

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
to this you will add three to four drops

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.340 
to this you will add three to four drops
of<00:04:11.020> protease<00:04:11.650> enzyme<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.420> experiment<00:04:14.080> we

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
of protease enzyme in this experiment we

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.560 
of protease enzyme in this experiment we
use<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.710> enzyme<00:04:15.100> trypsin<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:19.150> breaks<00:04:19.450> down

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
use the enzyme trypsin this breaks down

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:37.850 
use the enzyme trypsin this breaks down
the<00:04:19.900> protein<00:04:20.290> around<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.950> DNA

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.510 

next<00:04:38.850> ice-cold<00:04:39.720> ethanol<00:04:40.260> is<00:04:40.500> added<00:04:40.860> slowly

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
next ice-cold ethanol is added slowly

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.870 
next ice-cold ethanol is added slowly
and<00:04:41.820> carefully<00:04:42.330> at<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.540> 45<00:04:43.170> degree<00:04:43.200> angle<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.760> it

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
and carefully at a 45 degree angle so it

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.410 
and carefully at a 45 degree angle so it
forms<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.300> layer<00:04:45.510> on<00:04:45.780> top<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:46.530> your<00:04:46.680> filtration

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.960 

since<00:04:54.420> DNA<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.140> insoluble<00:04:55.410> in<00:04:56.070> alcohol<00:04:56.190> it

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
since DNA is insoluble in alcohol it

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.210 
since DNA is insoluble in alcohol it
participates<00:04:57.870> out<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> solution<00:04:59.040> and

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
participates out of the solution and

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.630 
participates out of the solution and
causes<00:05:00.060> DNA<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.510> become<00:05:00.900> less<00:05:01.110> dense<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.740> so

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
causes DNA to become less dense and so

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.090 
causes DNA to become less dense and so
this<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:03.030> why<00:05:03.180> DNA<00:05:03.780> floats<00:05:04.140> to<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.410> top<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.920> the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
this is why DNA floats to the top of the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:12.410 
this is why DNA floats to the top of the
solution<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:10.830> then<00:05:11.070> use<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.340> wire<00:05:11.700> loop<00:05:12.000> to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
solution you then use a wire loop to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.010 
solution you then use a wire loop to
spool<00:05:12.690> up<00:05:12.840> your<00:05:13.050> DNA<00:05:13.350> sample<00:05:13.860> for<00:05:14.040> observation

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
spool up your DNA sample for observation

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.420 
spool up your DNA sample for observation
well<00:05:16.020> done<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.590> have<00:05:16.710> now<00:05:16.860> managed<00:05:17.310> to
