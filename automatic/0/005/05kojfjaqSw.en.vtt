the<00:00:37.440> survivor<00:00:37.770> experiment<00:00:38.190> looks<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.460> he<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the survivor experiment looks like he is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.299 
the survivor experiment looks like he is
up<00:00:39.030> 1-0<00:00:40.700> against<00:00:41.700> hyah<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.920> hopefully<00:00:43.920> he'll

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
up 1-0 against hyah and hopefully he'll

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.560 
up 1-0 against hyah and hopefully he'll
pull<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.180> like

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

that<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.379> he<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.190> some<00:00:47.219> ridiculous

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that you know he has some ridiculous

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
that you know he has some ridiculous
ceremonies<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.050> check<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> our

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.970 
ceremonies that you can check out on our
se<00:00:50.460> channel<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.809> sure<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.559> channels

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
se channel and I'm sure other channels

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900 
se channel and I'm sure other channels
as<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:54.530> but<00:00:55.530> looks<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.309> an<00:00:56.430> early<00:00:56.670> pool

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
as well but looks like an early pool

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750 
as well but looks like an early pool
going<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.930> hyah<00:00:58.350> he's<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.340> something

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
going out for hyah he's going something

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
going out for hyah he's going something
like<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> 9<00:01:00.239> pool<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> looked<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.989> doesn't

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
like a 9 pool it looked like doesn't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
like a 9 pool it looked like doesn't
have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.739> second<00:01:02.070> overload<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> believe

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
have a second overload out so I believe

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
have a second overload out so I believe
that<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> nine<00:01:03.690> police<00:01:03.960> also<00:01:04.110> pulling<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that as a nine police also pulling a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.990 
that as a nine police also pulling a
drone<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:06.000> scout<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:08.070> fire<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:08.820> yer

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
drone to go scout and if fire by yer

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
drone to go scout and if fire by yer
puts<00:01:09.270> down<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> quick<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.049> seeds<00:01:10.409> could

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
puts down a quick see seeds could

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.320 
puts down a quick see seeds could
definitely<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> quick<00:01:11.640> game<00:01:11.790> extractor

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
definitely be a quick game extractor

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
definitely be a quick game extractor
going<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.869> well<00:01:13.650> doing<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.189> extractor
