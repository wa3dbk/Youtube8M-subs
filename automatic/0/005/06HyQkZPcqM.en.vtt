lead I start off with a center and I

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.099 
lead I start off with a center and I
would<00:04:14.860> usually<00:04:15.070> go<00:04:15.610> then<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.270> the<00:04:16.690> inner

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
would usually go then to the inner

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.099 
would usually go then to the inner
corner<00:04:17.580> but<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:19.150> lash<00:04:19.359> line<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.810> little<00:04:20.020> bit

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
corner but the lash line is a little bit

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.650 
corner but the lash line is a little bit
tense<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.220> then<00:04:21.580> go<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.240> outer<00:04:22.720> corner

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.540 

and<00:04:28.340> finally<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.240> inner<00:04:30.570> one<00:04:31.370> now<00:04:32.370> it's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
and finally to the inner one now it's

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.760 
and finally to the inner one now it's
easier<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.240> control<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.780> lash<00:04:33.960> line
