the slider to take it back to zero so if
I<00:00:43.859> slide<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.249> over<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.699> double<00:00:44.969> click<00:00:45.059> it

I slide this over and double click it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.360 
I slide this over and double click it
takes<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.749> back<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.019> zero<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:47.039> only<00:00:47.219> attribute

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
takes it back to zero the only attribute

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
takes it back to zero the only attribute
that<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.359> is<00:00:48.510> clarity

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
that I'm going to use here is clarity

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
that I'm going to use here is clarity
now<00:00:49.440> clarity<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> mid-tone<00:00:50.609> contrast

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
now clarity is a mid-tone contrast

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700 
now clarity is a mid-tone contrast
adjustment<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.319> to<00:00:52.379> leave<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
adjustment it's going to leave the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
adjustment it's going to leave the
extreme<00:00:53.010> black<00:00:53.309> alone<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.149> extreme<00:00:54.449> white

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
extreme black alone in the extreme white

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.529 
extreme black alone in the extreme white
alone<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.640> increase<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> contrast<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
alone and just increase the contrast in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.410 
alone and just increase the contrast in
the<00:00:57.569> mid-tone<00:00:57.989> areas<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.699> positive<00:00:59.699> clarity<00:01:00.210> is

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the mid-tone areas a positive clarity is

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.930 
the mid-tone areas a positive clarity is
going<00:01:00.569> to<00:01:00.629> give<00:01:00.809> me<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> increased<00:01:01.890> contrast<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
going to give me a increased contrast so

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
going to give me a increased contrast so
I'm<00:01:02.999> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.179> take<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> 50<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.650> start

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I'm going to take it up to 50 to start

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
I'm going to take it up to 50 to start
out<00:01:04.980> with<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:06.150> good<00:01:06.240> news<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.660> it

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
doesn't actually matter you just need to

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.950 
doesn't actually matter you just need to
have<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.730> number<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.330> start<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.780> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
have a number to start with because you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570 
have a number to start with because you
can<00:01:10.080> always<00:01:10.260> change<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.620> after<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> fact<00:01:11.160> all

right so I've set my clarity of 50 i'm
going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.410> ahead<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.650> start<00:01:13.830> just

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
painting over clicking and dragging over

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.680 
painting over clicking and dragging over
the<00:01:16.260> eye<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:17.640> paint<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> some

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
the eye to kind of paint in some

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.840 
the eye to kind of paint in some
contrast<00:01:19.170> adjustment<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> i'll<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> over

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
contrast adjustment and i'll do it over

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 
contrast adjustment and i'll do it over
the<00:01:20.940> second<00:01:21.270> i<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.420> well<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:22.230> maybe<00:01:22.380> i'll<00:01:22.560> come

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the second i as well and maybe i'll come

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.050 
the second i as well and maybe i'll come
over<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.010> eyebrows<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:23.940> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
over the eyebrows a little bit to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.690 
over the eyebrows a little bit to
increase<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> contrast<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.170> those<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
increase the contrast of those and it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.400 
increase the contrast of those and it
may<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:26.910> look<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.330> has<00:01:27.750> changed<00:01:27.870> but

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
may not look like much has changed but

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.260 
may not look like much has changed but
let's<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:28.830> toggle<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> preview<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.120> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
let's actually toggle the preview on and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
let's actually toggle the preview on and
off<00:01:30.360> i'll<00:01:30.570> press<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> letter<00:01:31.080> P<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:32.160> can<00:01:32.310> see

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
off i'll press the letter P you can see

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.070 
off i'll press the letter P you can see
there's<00:01:32.580> before<00:01:32.970> press<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> letter<00:01:33.600> P<00:01:33.780> again

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
there's before press the letter P again

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.380 
there's before press the letter P again
there's<00:01:35.010> after<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.910> see<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.180> really

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
there's after you can see I'm really

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.000 
there's after you can see I'm really
making<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:37.050> nice<00:01:37.200> contrast<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.830> along

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
making some nice contrast there along

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.520 
making some nice contrast there along
the<00:01:38.040> eyes<00:01:38.420> now<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the eyes now what I want to do is the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.560 
the eyes now what I want to do is the
opposite<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.010> that<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.370> want<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.730> decrease<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
opposite of that I want to decrease the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.080 
opposite of that I want to decrease the
contrast<00:01:43.230> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.650> skin<00:01:43.890> texture<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.970> an

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
contrast of the skin texture and do an

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
contrast of the skin texture and do an
overall<00:01:45.480> smoothing<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.290> well<00:01:46.980> it<00:01:47.070> turns

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
overall smoothing of that well it turns

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.610 
overall smoothing of that well it turns
out<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.090> use<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.330> negative<00:01:49.050> clarity

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
out that if you use a negative clarity

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.470 
out that if you use a negative clarity
value<00:01:49.980> you<00:01:50.550> get<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.850> opposite<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
value you get the opposite of a

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.700 
value you get the opposite of a
sharpening<00:01:51.810> effect<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
sharpening effect you actually get a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
sharpening effect you actually get a
smoothing<00:01:53.310> effect<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.270> clever

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
smoothing effect it's a very clever

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.390 
smoothing effect it's a very clever
little<00:01:54.840> technique<00:01:55.230> here<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.160> I'm<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.370> to

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
little technique here so I'm going to

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160 
little technique here so I'm going to
create<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.670> new<00:01:56.700> brush<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.660> don't<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.080> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
create a new brush I don't want to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
create a new brush I don't want to
modify<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.620> existing<00:01:58.800> brush<00:01:59.280> that's<00:01:59.460> just

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
modify the existing brush that's just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.180 
modify the existing brush that's just
for<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.000> eyes<00:02:00.120> if<00:02:00.480> I<00:02:00.570> hover<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.830> pin<00:02:02.040> it

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
for the eyes if I hover over the pin it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.250 
for the eyes if I hover over the pin it
actually<00:02:02.460> shows<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.540> highlighted<00:02:04.020> area

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
actually shows me the highlighted area

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
actually shows me the highlighted area
show<00:02:04.410> me<00:02:04.530> where<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.830> effect<00:02:05.160> has<00:02:05.250> been

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
show me where the effect has been

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.460 
show me where the effect has been
applied<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.780> click<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> new

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
applied to I'm going to click the new

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.929 
applied to I'm going to click the new
button<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:08.189> here<00:02:08.219> in<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> adjustment<00:02:08.879> brush

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
button over here in the adjustment brush

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.429 
button over here in the adjustment brush
and<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.810> time<00:02:09.989> I'm<00:02:10.109> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.409> a

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
and this time I'm going to use a

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.989 
and this time I'm going to use a
negative<00:02:11.009> clarity<00:02:11.370> I'm<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.640> drag<00:02:11.819> that

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:11.999 
negative clarity I'm going to drag that

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.330 
negative clarity I'm going to drag that
down<00:02:12.409> to<00:02:13.409> say<00:02:13.590> negative<00:02:13.980> 50

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
down to say negative 50

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
down to say negative 50
again<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> starting<00:02:15.150> point<00:02:15.360> maybe<00:02:16.260> I'll

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
again as a starting point maybe I'll

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.020 
again as a starting point maybe I'll
increase<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.920> brush<00:02:17.129> size<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.760> either<00:02:17.879> use

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
increase the brush size I can either use

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.150 
increase the brush size I can either use
the<00:02:18.269> right<00:02:18.750> or<00:02:18.870> left<00:02:18.900> bracket<00:02:19.110> keys<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.830> change

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the right or left bracket keys to change

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
the right or left bracket keys to change
the<00:02:20.310> size<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> brush<00:02:20.849> or<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.540> use<00:02:21.569> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the size of the brush or I can use the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.270 
the size of the brush or I can use the
sliders<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.379> on<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> right<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.099> you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
sliders here on the right it's up to you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.309 
sliders here on the right it's up to you
maybe<00:02:23.940> start<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> much<00:02:24.540> larger<00:02:24.900> brush<00:02:25.080> I'm

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
maybe start with a much larger brush I'm

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.660 
maybe start with a much larger brush I'm
going<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.530> really<00:02:25.709> take<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:25.980> feather<00:02:26.430> down

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
going to really take that feather down

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.119 
going to really take that feather down
though<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:28.019> so<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> lot<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
though just so that I don't do a lot of

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.500 
though just so that I don't do a lot of
spell<00:02:29.489> into<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.849> areas<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> I've<00:02:30.360> already

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
spell into the areas that I've already

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.720 
spell into the areas that I've already
modified<00:02:31.379> will<00:02:31.680> take<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> size<00:02:32.099> down<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.640> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
modified will take the size down just a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.410 
modified will take the size down just a
little<00:02:32.879> bit<00:02:33.000> more<00:02:33.269> maybe<00:02:33.569> size<00:02:33.900> 10<00:02:34.580> great<00:02:35.580> so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
little bit more maybe size 10 great so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
little bit more maybe size 10 great so
now<00:02:36.450> i'm<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.110> start<00:02:37.260> painting<00:02:37.769> with

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
now i'm going to start painting with

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.940 
now i'm going to start painting with
this<00:02:38.549> negative<00:02:39.000> clarity<00:02:39.569> over<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.680> skin

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
this negative clarity over the skin

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.979 
this negative clarity over the skin
detail<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.670> again<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.599> very<00:02:42.780> subtle

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
detail and again it's a very subtle

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.270 
detail and again it's a very subtle
effect<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.560> want<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> go<00:02:43.860> ahead<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.099> start

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
effect you want to go ahead and start

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.759 
effect you want to go ahead and start
out<00:02:44.430> small<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.780> always<00:02:45.989> modify<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.500> later

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
out small you can always modify it later

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.259 
out small you can always modify it later
if<00:02:47.069> i'm<00:02:47.310> going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.700> painted<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.120> this

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
if i'm going to be painted in this

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.089 
if i'm going to be painted in this
region<00:02:48.480> i<00:02:48.810> might<00:02:49.079> lower<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.500> size<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> brush

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
region i might lower the size the brush

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.949 
region i might lower the size the brush
temporarily<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.940> use<00:02:51.090> my<00:02:51.239> left<00:02:51.510> bracket<00:02:51.780> key

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
temporarily so use my left bracket key

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.960 
temporarily so use my left bracket key
to<00:02:52.140> make<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> brush<00:02:52.500> smaller<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.819> come

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
to make the brush smaller going to come

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.180 
to make the brush smaller going to come
in<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.480> avoid<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.989> edge<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.319> there<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
in here and avoid the edge is there of

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
in here and avoid the edge is there of
the<00:02:56.370> nose<00:02:56.549> just<00:02:57.510> really<00:02:57.810> kind<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.019> come<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the nose just really kind of come in and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.289 
the nose just really kind of come in and
decide<00:02:58.829> where<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.280> want<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.790> smoothing<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
decide where I want this smoothing to

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.780 
decide where I want this smoothing to
take<00:03:00.450> place<00:03:00.829> can<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:01.890> come<00:03:02.069> over<00:03:02.099> here<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.610> well

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
take place can I come over here as well

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you just need to decide where you want

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.940 
you just need to decide where you want
the<00:03:11.819> smoothing<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.329> occur<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.769> side

the smoothing to occur and on this side
of<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.129> nodes<00:03:14.370> touch<00:03:14.910> great<00:03:15.890> don't<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:17.010> to

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
of the nodes touch great don't want to

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.379 
of the nodes touch great don't want to
overdo<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.700> don't<00:03:17.760> want<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.000> make<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.150> look

overdo it we don't want to make a look

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.479 
overdo it we don't want to make a look
like<00:03:18.540> she's<00:03:18.750> porcelain<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.100> will<00:03:20.220> go<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
like she's porcelain and it will go and

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.250 
like she's porcelain and it will go and
modify<00:03:20.609> that<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> little<00:03:21.329> bit<00:03:21.389> after<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.079> fact

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
modify that a little bit after the fact

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.830 
modify that a little bit after the fact
once<00:03:22.530> we're<00:03:22.709> done<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.450> let's<00:03:24.450> do<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.660> for<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
once we're done and let's do the for it

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.699 
once we're done and let's do the for it
a<00:03:24.870> little<00:03:24.989> bit<00:03:25.170> will<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.500> brush<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
a little bit will make the brush a

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.410 
a little bit will make the brush a
little<00:03:25.769> bit<00:03:26.010> larger<00:03:26.130> using<00:03:26.579> my<00:03:26.670> right<00:03:26.880> bracket

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
little bit larger using my right bracket

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.240 
little bit larger using my right bracket
key<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:28.290> we'll<00:03:28.410> come<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.680> here<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:28.980> smooth

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
key and we'll come in here and smooth

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.180 
key and we'll come in here and smooth
out<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.519> forehead<00:03:29.819> just<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.120> touch<00:03:31.130> all<00:03:32.130> right

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190

out the forehead just to touch all right
now<00:03:32.609> let's<00:03:33.450> see<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> before<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.170> after<00:03:34.500> okay

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
now let's see the before and after okay

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.220 
now let's see the before and after okay
let's<00:03:35.069> turn<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> preview<00:03:35.730> off<00:03:36.230> there's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
let's turn the preview off there's

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.370 
let's turn the preview off there's
before<00:03:37.940> there's<00:03:38.940> after<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:39.660> those<00:03:39.870> pins<00:03:40.200> are

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
before there's after if those pins are

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.690 
before there's after if those pins are
getting<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.739> way<00:03:40.889> let's<00:03:41.160> turn<00:03:41.370> off<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
getting in the way let's turn off the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.159 
getting in the way let's turn off the
show<00:03:41.880> pins<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.540> i<00:03:42.599> can<00:03:42.750> press<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.019> letter

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
show pins and can i can press the letter

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.680 
show pins and can i can press the letter
V<00:03:43.260> for<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:43.919> so<00:03:44.579> without<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:45.000> striking<00:03:45.480> pins

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
V for that so without the striking pins

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.170 
V for that so without the striking pins
here's<00:03:46.019> before<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.769> there's<00:03:47.579> after<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.150> you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
here's before and there's after and you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.789 
here's before and there's after and you
can<00:03:48.359> see<00:03:48.480> I've<00:03:48.569> gotten<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.959> nice<00:03:49.230> smoothing

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
can see I've gotten a nice smoothing

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.680 
can see I've gotten a nice smoothing
around<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.190> skin<00:03:50.489> but<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.150> nice<00:03:51.329> contrast

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
around the skin but a nice contrast

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.050 
around the skin but a nice contrast
enhancement<00:03:52.440> around<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.919> eyes<00:03:53.069> now<00:03:53.790> if<00:03:53.940> we

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
enhancement around the eyes now if we

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.520 
enhancement around the eyes now if we
feel<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.329> we've<00:03:54.599> actually<00:03:54.810> made<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.349> skin

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
feel that we've actually made the skin

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.250 
feel that we've actually made the skin
too<00:03:55.889> smooth<00:03:56.190> fake<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.000> porcelain<00:03:57.359> like<00:03:57.569> well

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
too smooth fake and porcelain like well

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.509 
too smooth fake and porcelain like well
here's<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.590> great<00:03:58.769> part<00:03:58.799> let's<00:03:59.220> turn<00:03:59.430> those

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
here's the great part let's turn those

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.000 
here's the great part let's turn those
pins<00:03:59.790> back<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.200> let's<00:04:01.200> make<00:04:01.410> sure<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
pins back on let's make sure that the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.550 
pins back on let's make sure that the
skin<00:04:02.459> pin<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.329> selected<00:04:03.750> which<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.109> i<00:04:04.290> hover

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
skin pin is selected which it is i hover

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.500 
skin pin is selected which it is i hover
over<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.799> i<00:04:04.919> can<00:04:05.190> see<00:04:05.370> where<00:04:05.609> it's<00:04:06.269> being

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
over that i can see where it's being

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.870 
over that i can see where it's being
painted<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.109> i<00:04:07.829> can<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.130> take<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.400> clarity

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
painted and i can just take that clarity

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.030 
painted and i can just take that clarity
value<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.450> slide<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.750> back<00:04:10.109> towards<00:04:10.799> more

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
value and slide it back towards more

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.770 
value and slide it back towards more
positive<00:04:11.579> numbers<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.060> if<00:04:12.120> i<00:04:12.209> take<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:12.660> to

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
positive numbers so if i take that up to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.500 
positive numbers so if i take that up to
30<00:04:13.109> you<00:04:13.919> can<00:04:14.099> see<00:04:14.310> i'm<00:04:14.609> bringing<00:04:15.060> some<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.329> that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
30 you can see i'm bringing some of that

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.569 
30 you can see i'm bringing some of that
skin<00:04:15.780> texture<00:04:16.200> back<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.799> have<00:04:16.919> total

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
skin texture back so you have total

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.759 
skin texture back so you have total
flexibility<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.510> again<00:04:19.320> if<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.500> retouch

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
flexibility here again if the retouch

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.259 
flexibility here again if the retouch
needs<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.039> get<00:04:20.160> more<00:04:20.250> complex<00:04:20.700> than<00:04:20.849> this<00:04:21.030> then

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
needs to get more complex than this then

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.670 
needs to get more complex than this then
that's<00:04:21.660> when<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:21.989> want<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.229> probably<00:04:22.349> take<00:04:22.500> it

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
that's when you want to probably take it
