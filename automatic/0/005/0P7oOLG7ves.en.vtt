00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.530 

after<00:00:03.060> cleaning<00:00:03.330> up<00:00:04.279> we<00:00:05.279> just<00:00:05.490> have<00:00:06.390> to

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
after cleaning up we just have to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.450 
after cleaning up we just have to
prepare<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.140> machine<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:08.150> actually<00:00:09.150> 35

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
prepare this machine for actually 35

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.669 
prepare this machine for actually 35
pure<00:00:11.460> spirit<00:00:11.910> distillation<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.200> have

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
pure spirit distillation so we just have

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:27.050 
pure spirit distillation so we just have
to<00:00:13.710> close<00:00:14.540> over<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.670> next<00:00:26.880> step

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
to close over now and so the next step

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
to close over now and so the next step
we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.660> find<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.080> how<00:00:28.410> much<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> pro

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we have to find out how much a pro

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
we have to find out how much a pro
spirit<00:00:29.699> did<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> student<00:00:30.900> yesterday

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
spirit did with the student yesterday

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.110 
spirit did with the student yesterday
and<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.679> percentage<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> spirit<00:00:32.940> will

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and what percentage of the spirit will

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:52.340 
and what percentage of the spirit will
go<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.420> particular<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> 2<00:00:49.559> meter<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> we

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
go this particular one is 2 meter so we

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.119 
go this particular one is 2 meter so we
need<00:00:53.600> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.509 

so<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> mean<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.090> approximately<00:01:00.949> 40%<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
so I mean but approximately 40% of

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.700 
so I mean but approximately 40% of
spirit<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.780> solution<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
spirit in this solution so we have to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
spirit in this solution so we have to
break<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.070> somewhere<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.690> forget

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
break it it somewhere so don't forget

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.800 
break it it somewhere so don't forget
that<00:01:13.229> we're<00:01:13.409> dealing<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.920> wrong<00:01:14.220> spirit<00:01:14.810> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that we're dealing this wrong spirit it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.139 
that we're dealing this wrong spirit it
seems<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> king<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.700> suitable

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
seems to be a king but it's not suitable

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.830 
seems to be a king but it's not suitable
for<00:01:18.299> drinking<00:01:19.729> another<00:01:20.729> system<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.509> world

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
for drinking another system this world

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
for drinking another system this world
spirit<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> final<00:01:22.799> product<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.399> our<00:01:23.580> case

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
spirit is the final product in our case

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.210 
spirit is the final product in our case
it's<00:01:24.180> SEMA<00:01:24.420> product<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.170> gonna<00:01:25.350> process

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it's SEMA product and we gonna process

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's SEMA product and we gonna process
it<00:01:26.280> through<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.170> feel<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.619> our<00:01:32.490> scene

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it through so we feel about our scene

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.410 
it through so we feel about our scene
and<00:01:35.780> trying<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.399> count<00:01:38.399> for<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> amount<00:01:39.149> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and trying to count for the amount of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.139 
and trying to count for the amount of
liquid<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.899> be<00:01:39.990> put<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> we've<00:01:43.649> got<00:01:44.149> total

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
liquid to be put in so we've got total

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.980 
liquid to be put in so we've got total
nine<00:01:45.600> meters<00:01:47.179> so<00:01:48.179> we<00:01:48.330> would<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.659> need<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
nine meters so we would not need to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.330 
nine meters so we would not need to
suffer<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.380> spirit<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.789> vessel<00:01:51.140> it's

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
suffer all spirit in this vessel it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.919 
suffer all spirit in this vessel it's
six<00:01:53.340> liters<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.210> previous

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
six liters from the previous

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.279 
six liters from the previous
distillation<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:58.700> three<00:01:59.700> liters<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
distillation and three liters of the

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.550 
distillation and three liters of the
spirit<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.009> actually<00:02:02.490> left<00:02:02.880> almost<00:02:03.229> out<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
spirit that actually left almost out of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.520 
spirit that actually left almost out of
some<00:02:05.430> other<00:02:05.549> previous<00:02:06.060> situations<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.500> we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
some other previous situations so we

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.819 
some other previous situations so we
have<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.119> make<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> relative<00:02:09.869> percentage<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
have to make a relative percentage of

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.690 
have to make a relative percentage of
our<00:02:10.979> stuff<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.480> amount<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:13.140> our<00:02:13.530> stuff<00:02:13.920> in

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
our stuff and the amount of our stuff in

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.050 
our stuff and the amount of our stuff in
this<00:02:14.910> case<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.420> 9<00:02:15.630> litres<00:02:16.079> at<00:02:16.260> 40%

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
this case it's 9 litres at 40%

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.479 
this case it's 9 litres at 40%
so<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.410> minimum<00:02:19.950> level<00:02:21.859> minimum<00:02:22.859> volume<00:02:23.160> of

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
so the minimum level minimum volume of

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.759 
so the minimum level minimum volume of
liquids<00:02:24.030> that's<00:02:24.600> supposed<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.109> be<00:02:25.230> left<00:02:25.590> in

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
liquids that's supposed to be left in

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.090 
liquids that's supposed to be left in
this<00:02:25.950> distiller<00:02:26.790> after<00:02:27.650> distillation<00:02:28.650> is

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
this distiller after distillation is

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.780 
this distiller after distillation is
finished<00:02:29.579> is<00:02:29.820> around<00:02:31.250> 7<00:02:32.250> liters<00:02:32.640> so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.000 

you<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.870> make<00:02:37.170> sure<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.739> after

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you just have to make sure that after

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.330 
you just have to make sure that after
whole<00:02:38.489> spirits<00:02:39.000> evaporate<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:41.129> case

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
whole spirits evaporate in this case

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.030 
whole spirits evaporate in this case
it's<00:02:41.519> 40%<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.450> will<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.930> enough<00:02:43.230> liquid<00:02:43.800> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
it's 40% this will be enough liquid to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.630 
it's 40% this will be enough liquid to
cover<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.030> heating<00:02:45.510> element<00:02:45.930> other<00:02:46.140> way

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
cover the heating element other way

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.420 
cover the heating element other way
element<00:02:47.640> will<00:02:47.819> be<00:02:48.000> stuffed<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.310> after<00:02:50.310> you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
element will be stuffed so after you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.880 
element will be stuffed so after you
edit<00:02:50.819> some<00:02:51.709> spirit<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.180> add<00:02:54.890> in

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
edit some spirit in you have to add in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.820 
edit some spirit in you have to add in
these<00:02:56.130> keys<00:02:56.489> approximately<00:02:57.420> 5<00:02:58.080> litres<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
these keys approximately 5 litres of

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.910 
these keys approximately 5 litres of
water

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.979 

so<00:03:04.920> once<00:03:05.190> water<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.269> time<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.959> a

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
so once water is in it it's time to a

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.009 
so once water is in it it's time to a
sample<00:03:07.470> our<00:03:08.840> rational

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
sample our rational

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:30.000 
sample our rational
distillation<00:03:10.640> core<00:03:14.390> similar<00:03:15.390> way

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.000 

so<00:03:30.610> it's<00:03:30.819> just<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.750> same<00:03:31.780> as<00:03:32.260> easy<00:03:32.620> as<00:03:32.860> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
so it's just the same as easy as the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.050 
so it's just the same as easy as the
previous<00:03:33.459> one

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
previous one

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.460 
previous one
once<00:03:34.900> we<00:03:35.110> added<00:03:35.319> water<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:37.660> can<00:03:38.050> be<00:03:38.230> sure<00:03:38.440> that

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
once we added water we can be sure that

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.830 
once we added water we can be sure that
our<00:03:38.860> element<00:03:39.310> will<00:03:39.489> make<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.940> putt<00:03:40.239> for<00:03:40.390> example

our element will make a putt for example
if<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.050> are<00:03:41.110> working<00:03:41.489> with<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.670> capacity<00:03:43.569> so

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
if you are working with the capacity so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.949 
if you are working with the capacity so
20<00:03:44.800> liters<00:03:45.129> of<00:03:45.340> raw<00:03:45.580> spirit<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.209> 50%<00:03:46.540> you

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
20 liters of raw spirit that 50% you

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.500 
20 liters of raw spirit that 50% you
don't<00:03:47.170> have<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.470> worry<00:03:47.680> about<00:03:47.800> any<00:03:48.160> water

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't have to worry about any water

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.170 
don't have to worry about any water
because<00:03:49.510> after<00:03:49.810> 50%<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.560> spirit<00:03:50.950> or<00:03:51.040> birds<00:03:51.550> is

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
because after 50% of spirit or birds is

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.290 
because after 50% of spirit or birds is
going<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.599> be<00:03:52.690> 10<00:03:52.900> liters<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.410> liquid<00:03:53.530> lift<00:03:54.300> but

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
going to be 10 liters of liquid lift but

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.720 
going to be 10 liters of liquid lift but
if<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.599> are<00:03:55.660> working<00:03:55.900> with<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.730> smaller

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
if you are working with the smaller

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.229 
if you are working with the smaller
volumes<00:03:58.269> like<00:03:58.510> 6<00:03:58.989> 5<00:03:59.920> liters<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.610> raw<00:04:00.790> spirit

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
volumes like 6 5 liters of raw spirit

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.690 
volumes like 6 5 liters of raw spirit
you<00:04:02.230> have<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.590> make<00:04:02.739> sure<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:03.310> after<00:04:03.489> a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
you have to make sure that after a

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.949 
you have to make sure that after a
spirit<00:04:04.180> evaporates<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:05.400> plenty<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.430> liquid

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
spirit evaporates is plenty of liquid

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:16.180 
spirit evaporates is plenty of liquid
left<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.290> coal<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.930> close<00:04:13.930> everything<00:04:14.260> down

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
left and coal so close everything down

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.710 
left and coal so close everything down

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.800 

and<00:04:23.860> we<00:04:24.280> have<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.610> make<00:04:24.790> sure<00:04:25.060> that<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:27.250> will

now<00:04:32.010> let's<00:04:32.340> try<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.730> make<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> calculation

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
now let's try to make a calculation

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.530 
now let's try to make a calculation
because<00:04:34.230> in<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.400> our<00:04:36.210> situation

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
because in this is our situation

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.200 
because in this is our situation
supposed<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.410> be<00:04:37.530> very<00:04:37.740> precise<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.580> it's

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
supposed to be very precise and it's

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.560 
supposed to be very precise and it's
it's<00:04:39.900> not<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.170> guesswork<00:04:41.030> we<00:04:42.030> have<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.390> make

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
it's not the guesswork we have to make

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.490 
it's not the guesswork we have to make
some<00:04:43.310> guidance<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.640> ourself<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:46.020> go<00:04:46.200> through

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
some guidance for ourself to go through

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.140 
some guidance for ourself to go through
the<00:04:46.650> distillation<00:04:46.980> we<00:04:47.430> just<00:04:47.640> hit<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:48.030> know

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
the distillation we just hit to know

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.180 
the distillation we just hit to know
step<00:04:48.540> by<00:04:48.750> step<00:04:49.020> what<00:04:49.200> kind<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.530> spirits<00:04:50.010> and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
step by step what kind of spirits and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.540 
step by step what kind of spirits and
what<00:04:50.310> amounts<00:04:50.790> we're<00:04:51.480> gonna<00:04:51.690> take<00:04:52.340> from<00:04:53.340> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
what amounts we're gonna take from the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.160 
what amounts we're gonna take from the
machine<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:56.010> while<00:04:56.880> our<00:04:57.030> system<00:04:57.690> is<00:04:57.840> getting

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
machine so while our system is getting

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.420 
machine so while our system is getting
hot<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.680> before<00:04:59.460> first<00:04:59.790> spirit<00:05:00.150> has<00:05:00.270> come<00:05:00.360> out

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
hot and before first spirit has come out

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.730 
hot and before first spirit has come out
we<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.730> make<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.940> calculation<00:05:03.500> now<00:05:04.500> we

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
we have to make a calculation now we

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.910 
we have to make a calculation now we
just<00:05:05.070> have<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.850> Phoebus<00:05:06.300> at<00:05:06.510> 40%<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.380> 9<00:05:07.530> liters

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
just have to Phoebus at 40% and 9 liters

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.670 
just have to Phoebus at 40% and 9 liters
of<00:05:08.070> spirit<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:08.730> we<00:05:09.600> have<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.900> find<00:05:10.140> out<00:05:10.350> how

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
of spirit so we have to find out how

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.270 
of spirit so we have to find out how
much<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:11.190> 100%<00:05:12.120> spirit<00:05:12.570> we<00:05:13.560> really<00:05:13.830> wrote<00:05:14.070> in

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
much of 100% spirit we really wrote in

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.540 
much of 100% spirit we really wrote in
this<00:05:14.430> solution<00:05:14.850> for<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.780> we<00:05:16.740> have<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.070> take

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
this solution for that we have to take

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.410 
this solution for that we have to take
very<00:05:18.270> simple<00:05:18.570> calculator<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.970> make<00:05:21.180> very

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
very simple calculator and make very

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.030 
very simple calculator and make very
simple<00:05:22.430> population<00:05:23.430> in<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:24.720> case<00:05:24.990> 40<00:05:25.830> liters

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
simple population in this case 40 liters

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.810 
simple population in this case 40 liters
