into<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.730> few<00:01:04.239> sections<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.960> cut<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.340> aluminum

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
into a few sections I cut the aluminum

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.640 
into a few sections I cut the aluminum
foil<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:07.390> suggest<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.259> already<00:01:08.410> have

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
foil and I suggest that you already have

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.030 
foil and I suggest that you already have
that<00:01:08.800> precooked<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.630> straight<00:01:11.350> up<00:01:11.380> put<00:01:11.830> the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
that precooked so I straight up put the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.920 
that precooked so I straight up put the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
hair dye on my hair I can add any

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.710 
hair dye on my hair I can add any
conditioner<00:01:14.560> or<00:01:14.830> anything<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.720> straight

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
conditioner or anything this is straight

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.740 
conditioner or anything this is straight
from<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.990> tube<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:18.670> making<00:01:18.880> trinket<00:01:19.360> every

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
from the tube and I making trinket every

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:29.219 
from the tube and I making trinket every
little<00:01:19.900> strand<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:28.270> flipped<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.899> over<00:01:29.020> to

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
little strand then I flipped it over to

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:39.320 
little strand then I flipped it over to
get<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> backside<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:29.979> it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.740 

and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.170> got<00:01:40.290> tired<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.800> tin<00:01:41.040> foil<00:01:41.370> so<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.270> let<00:01:42.600> go

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and it got tired of tin foil so I let go

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.380 
and it got tired of tin foil so I let go
of<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.260> I<00:01:43.350> started<00:01:43.650> combing<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:45.210> make

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
of that and I started combing it to make

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.230 
of that and I started combing it to make
sure<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.660> was<00:01:45.780> evenly<00:01:46.140> distributed<00:01:47.090> from<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
sure it was evenly distributed from the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
sure it was evenly distributed from the
tips<00:01:48.480> of<00:01:48.570> my<00:01:48.630> hair<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.290> bringing<00:01:49.620> it<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
tips of my hair and then bringing it a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.290 
tips of my hair and then bringing it a
little<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.970> make<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:52.140> softer<00:01:53.300> gradient

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
little up to make it the softer gradient

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.350 
little up to make it the softer gradient
to<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.020> transition<00:01:55.560> better<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.210> dye

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to make it transition better and the dye

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.620 
to make it transition better and the dye
says<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.020> mix<00:01:58.230> it<00:01:58.440> until<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.920> frothy<00:01:59.630> so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
says to mix it until it's frothy so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
says to mix it until it's frothy so
that's<00:02:01.050> what<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:01.380> doing<00:02:01.770> throughout<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that's what i was doing throughout this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.510 
that's what i was doing throughout this
video<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.240> i<00:02:03.750> add<00:02:03.870> more<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.320> tips<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:05.490> make

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
video and i add more to the tips to make

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.340 
video and i add more to the tips to make
that<00:02:05.880> part<00:02:06.180> brighter<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.840> mixing<00:02:13.170> until

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that part brighter so just mixing until

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.810 
that part brighter so just mixing until
it's<00:02:13.560> frothy<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:19.320> finger<00:02:19.950> combed<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.520> lot

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
it's frothy and I finger combed a lot

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.870 
it's frothy and I finger combed a lot
because<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.570> helped<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> ombre<00:02:22.880> when

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
because this helped with the ombre when

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.820 
because this helped with the ombre when
you<00:02:24.000> bring<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.020> there's<00:02:25.350> like<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you bring it up and there's like a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.250 
you bring it up and there's like a
little<00:02:26.550> bit<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.880> hair<00:02:27.060> dye<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.630> gloves<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
little bit of hair dye on your gloves it

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:40.770 
little bit of hair dye on your gloves it
makes<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.770> transition<00:02:29.100> better

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.620 

and<00:02:41.380> then<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> add<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> little<00:02:42.250> bit<00:02:42.430> more<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:43.480> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
and then I add a little bit more of the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.380 
and then I add a little bit more of the
turquoise<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> tips<00:02:44.830> before<00:02:45.250> i<00:02:45.700> put<00:02:46.270> in

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
turquoise to the tips before i put in

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.559 
turquoise to the tips before i put in
tin<00:02:46.720> foil<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.490> throughout<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.060> video<00:02:49.240> you

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
tin foil and throughout this video you

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.490 
tin foil and throughout this video you
will<00:02:49.600> see<00:02:49.750> me<00:02:49.990> progressively<00:02:50.590> get<00:02:50.890> worse<00:02:50.920> at

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
will see me progressively get worse at

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.860 
will see me progressively get worse at
foiling<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:53.800> hair<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.489> top<00:03:01.420> layer

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
foiling my hair so this is the top layer

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
section because in this video would be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.500
