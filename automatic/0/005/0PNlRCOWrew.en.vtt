small buildings and all that sort of
stuff<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.270> piece<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.809> I've

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
stuff this is one piece that I've

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.090 
stuff this is one piece that I've
produced<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.790> flames<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.149> war<00:00:36.469> it's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.620> resin

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
produced for flames of war it's a resin

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
cast mat cetera I've got four or five
types<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> designs<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.020> these<00:00:43.170> sorts<00:00:43.440> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
types of designs of these sorts of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.690 
types of designs of these sorts of
earrings<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.460> talking<00:00:44.550> about

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
earrings so we're talking about

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
earrings so we're talking about
different<00:00:45.059> types<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.239> silicon's<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.230> who's

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
different types of silicon's and who's

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
different types of silicon's and who's
asked<00:00:47.219> me<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:49.260> different

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
asked me what I use and the different

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.029 
asked me what I use and the different
types<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.890> resins<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> stuff<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:52.039> for

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
types of resins and stuff that I use for

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
types of resins and stuff that I use for
forecasting<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.000> thought<00:00:54.120> I'd<00:00:54.239> quickly

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
forecasting and so I thought I'd quickly

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.569 
forecasting and so I thought I'd quickly
put<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> quick<00:00:54.899> video<00:00:55.170> response<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> quick

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
put up a quick video response or a quick

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.299 
put up a quick video response or a quick
video<00:00:56.879> primarily<00:00:57.809> fir<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.739> Adam<00:00:59.010> since<00:00:59.219> I

silicon as I mentioned it's an RVT -
silicon<00:01:20.960> its<00:01:22.430> condensation<00:01:23.430> cured<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.909> when

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
silicon its condensation cured so when

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.140 
silicon its condensation cured so when
mixed<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.720> hardener<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> dries<00:01:25.590> overnight

this is looks a little bit like peanut
butter<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:30.479> doesn't<00:01:31.079> flow<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> brush

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
butter it doesn't flow so you can brush

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
butter it doesn't flow so you can brush
it<00:01:32.790> onto<00:01:33.060> stuff<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.439> example<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it onto stuff so for example that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.460 
it onto stuff so for example that
building<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.610> showed<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.350> one

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
building that I showed this little one

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.120 
building that I showed this little one
here<00:01:38.869> with<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> removable<00:01:40.439> roof<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.240 
by the way I used the brush shovel
silicon<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:49.110> here's<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> molds<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
silicon so here's one of the molds that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
silicon so here's one of the molds that
I<00:01:50.670> use<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.119> casting<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> has<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> plaster

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I use for casting that it has a plaster

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580 
I use for casting that it has a plaster

for<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.799> take<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.399> out<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.719> pull<00:01:57.990> this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
for I take this bit out and I pull this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
for I take this bit out and I pull this
out<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> boot<00:01:59.119> you'll<00:02:00.119> notice<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
out of the boot you'll notice at the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
out of the boot you'll notice at the
bottom<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> mold<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:04.130> like<00:02:05.130> thick<00:02:05.399> paint

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
bottom of the mold is like thick paint

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.499 
bottom of the mold is like thick paint
this<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:06.899> been<00:02:07.049> brushed<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.829> -<00:02:08.390> actually<00:02:09.390> this

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
this has been brushed on - actually this

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.110 
this has been brushed on - actually this
is<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> exactly

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
is the exactly

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.650 
is the exactly
this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> exact<00:02:12.750> model<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:15.270> piece<00:02:15.480> was

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
this is the exact model this piece was

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
this is the exact model this piece was
originally<00:02:15.780> cast<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:18.950> cast<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
originally cast like this cast on on a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.250 
originally cast like this cast on on a
piece<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.850> MDF<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:23.780> small<00:02:24.780> wall<00:02:25.020> around

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
piece of MDF but a small wall around

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.720 
piece of MDF but a small wall around
actually<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> build<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.920> wall<00:02:26.070> afterwards<00:02:26.550> I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
actually I build the wall afterwards I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.850 
actually I build the wall afterwards I
glued<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.600> original<00:02:28.170> master<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> piece<00:02:28.740> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
glued the original master to a piece of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.490 
glued the original master to a piece of
MDF<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:30.120> brushed<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.990> whole<00:02:31.200> bunch<00:02:31.230> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
MDF I then brushed on a whole bunch of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.520 
MDF I then brushed on a whole bunch of
this<00:02:31.710> silicon<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:34.220> cover<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.430> model<00:02:37.970> and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
this silicon to cover that model and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.990 
this silicon to cover that model and
then<00:02:40.530> around<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.980> outside<00:02:41.010> I've<00:02:41.790> got<00:02:41.850> a

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
then around the outside I've got a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.330 
then around the outside I've got a
little<00:02:42.240> wall<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.750> then<00:02:43.440> covered<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.890> with

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
little wall and then covered it with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.940 
little wall and then covered it with
some<00:02:44.670> plaster<00:02:45.420> cloth<00:02:45.570> now<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.410> reason<00:02:46.830> I've

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
some plaster cloth now the reason I've

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.520 
some plaster cloth now the reason I've
done<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.400> as<00:02:47.610> opposed<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> building<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.260> wall

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
done this as opposed to building a wall

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.160 
done this as opposed to building a wall
all<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.130> way<00:02:50.220> around<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.700> model<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.240> filling

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
all the way around the model and filling

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.560 
all the way around the model and filling
it<00:02:52.260> up<00:02:52.350> with<00:02:52.410> plaster<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.360> do

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
it up with plaster kind of like you do

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.240 
it up with plaster kind of like you do
for<00:02:56.510> casting<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.690> wall<00:02:57.930> section<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:59.010> here

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
for casting up a wall section so in here

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
for casting up a wall section so in here
is<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> wall<00:02:59.670> section<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.270> this<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
is a wall section and this is just a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.040 
is a wall section and this is just a
solid<00:03:01.440> mold<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.070> can<00:03:02.250> flex<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.090> that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
solid mold and I can flex this and that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.930 
solid mold and I can flex this and that
wall<00:03:04.560> section<00:03:05.100> pops<00:03:05.490> out<00:03:06.020> or<00:03:07.430> for<00:03:08.430> casting

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
wall section pops out or for casting

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.320 
wall section pops out or for casting
basis<00:03:09.450> it's<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.500> shallow<00:03:10.710> cast<00:03:11.150> again<00:03:12.150> you

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
basis it's just a shallow cast again you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.970 
basis it's just a shallow cast again you
can<00:03:12.510> see<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> Lego<00:03:13.080> print<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.740> side<00:03:13.950> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
can see the Lego print on the side of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770 
can see the Lego print on the side of
this<00:03:14.250> mold<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.790> where<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.940> put<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> Lego<00:03:15.480> wall

around<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.410> Masters<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.040> poured<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.090> this

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
around the Masters and poured in this

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.820 
around the Masters and poured in this
type<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.320> silicon<00:03:20.390> which<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.510> mentioned<00:03:21.930> ultra

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
type of silicon which I mentioned ultra

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.430

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
it if this middle bit under here is full

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.420 
it if this middle bit under here is full
of<00:04:09.360> silicon<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.050> just<00:04:10.740> won't<00:04:10.830> be<00:04:10.920> out<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.070> Flex

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
of silicon I just won't be out of Flex

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.000 
of silicon I just won't be out of Flex
it<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:12.570> get<00:04:12.720> them<00:04:12.870> piece<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:13.590> that's<00:04:13.860> why<00:04:13.980> I

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
it to get them piece out so that's why I

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.290 
it to get them piece out so that's why I
had<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.280> use<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.550> brush<00:04:14.730> will<00:04:14.940> silicon<00:04:15.240> on

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
had to use the brush will silicon on

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.000 
had to use the brush will silicon on
this<00:04:15.450> side<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.320> piece<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.710> actually

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
this side that the piece can actually

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.400 
this side that the piece can actually
dis<00:04:17.160> peels<00:04:17.790> off

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.770 

there's<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.560> big<00:04:22.770> piece<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:22.980> silicon<00:04:23.780> it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
there's that big piece of silicon it

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.360 
there's that big piece of silicon it
peels<00:04:25.139> off<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.650> mean<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.860> can<00:04:26.040> turn<00:04:26.250> this

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
peels off it I mean I can turn this

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.940 
peels off it I mean I can turn this
inside<00:04:26.610> out<00:04:26.820> it's<00:04:27.210> quite<00:04:27.510> quite<00:04:28.410> strong<00:04:28.770> and

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
inside out it's quite quite strong and

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.740 
inside out it's quite quite strong and
flexible<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:31.910> just<00:04:32.910> really<00:04:33.120> quickly<00:04:33.330> Adam

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
flexible so just really quickly Adam

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.360 
flexible so just really quickly Adam
they're<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> two<00:04:34.770> silicones<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.280> was

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
they're the two silicones that I was

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.150 
they're the two silicones that I was
talking<00:04:35.639> about<00:04:35.669> in<00:04:35.850> Skype<00:04:36.150> both<00:04:37.110> RVT<00:04:37.740> at<00:04:37.889> our

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
talking about in Skype both RVT at our

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.900 
talking about in Skype both RVT at our
TV<00:04:38.370> silicon's<00:04:39.590> both<00:04:40.590> um<00:04:40.830> condensation<00:04:41.610> cured

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
TV silicon's both um condensation cured

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.170 
TV silicon's both um condensation cured
both<00:04:42.600> ten<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.020> one<00:04:43.200> ratio<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:43.980> ten<00:04:44.940> parts

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
both ten to one ratio so ten parts

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.080 
both ten to one ratio so ten parts
hardened<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:45.660> 100<00:04:46.020> parts<00:04:46.350> silicon<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.220> weigh

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
hardened to 100 parts silicon I weigh

hardened to 100 parts silicon I weigh
that<00:04:48.300> out<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.690> mix<00:04:48.930> them<00:04:49.020> up<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.470> the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
that out and I mix them up and the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.129 
that out and I mix them up and the
reason<00:04:50.460> why<00:04:50.610> as<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.360> was<00:04:51.450> saying<00:04:51.630> in<00:04:51.750> Skype

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
reason why as I was saying in Skype

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.080 
reason why as I was saying in Skype
I<00:04:52.169> used<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.830> brushable<00:04:53.160> silicon<00:04:53.610> for<00:04:53.850> some

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
I used the brushable silicon for some

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.830 
I used the brushable silicon for some
models<00:04:54.419> is<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.230> can<00:04:55.260> peel<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.800> off<00:04:56.840> once

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
models is so that I can peel it off once

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.909 
models is so that I can peel it off once
you've<00:04:57.960> cut<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.169> few<00:04:58.440> things<00:04:58.620> up<00:04:58.740> you'll<00:04:58.890> be

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
you've cut a few things up you'll be

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.500 
you've cut a few things up you'll be
able<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.220> identify<00:04:59.730> what<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.180> will<00:05:00.360> be<00:05:00.480> able

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
able to identify what you will be able

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.710 
able to identify what you will be able
to<00:05:00.690> cast<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.070> mold<00:05:02.310> box<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.419> what<00:05:03.600> you

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
to cast in a mold box and what you

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.380 
to cast in a mold box and what you
really<00:05:03.930> should<00:05:04.080> use<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.820> brush<00:05:05.820> for<00:05:05.880> silicon

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
really should use a brush for silicon

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.510 
really should use a brush for silicon
for<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:07.380> generally<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.070> has<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.400> do<00:05:08.490> with

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
for and generally it has to do with

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.250 
for and generally it has to do with
being<00:05:08.910> able<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.150> get<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.540> piece<00:05:09.750> out<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.020> the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
being able to get the piece out of the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.510 
being able to get the piece out of the
mold<00:05:10.729> so<00:05:13.010> there<00:05:14.010> we<00:05:14.100> go

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
mold so there we go

pond<00:05:48.780> again<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.830> reason<00:05:50.100> why<00:05:50.220> I've<00:05:50.340> used<00:05:50.610> this

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
pond again the reason why I've used this

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.340 
pond again the reason why I've used this
one<00:05:50.970> is<00:05:51.090> because<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.450> ponds<00:05:51.690> flat<00:05:51.990> it's<00:05:52.140> easy

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
one is because the ponds flat it's easy

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.409 
one is because the ponds flat it's easy
to<00:05:52.500> pop<00:05:52.680> out<00:05:52.860> of<00:05:53.010> here<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:54.000> have<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.180> pond

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
to pop out of here so I have a pond

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.800 
to pop out of here so I have a pond
around<00:05:54.539> the<00:05:54.690> place<00:05:54.840> somewhere<00:05:55.110> have<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> second

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
around the place somewhere have a second

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.110
