00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
go into debt from this one and then I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.899

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and I've done that before and they

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
and I've done that before and they
didn't<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.090> too<00:01:54.329> many<00:01:54.450> views<00:01:54.810> which<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.530> why<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
didn't get too many views which is why I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.730 
didn't get too many views which is why I
kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.950> stopped<00:01:56.159> doing<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.740> but

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
kind of stopped doing them but if but

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410 
kind of stopped doing them but if but
now<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> obviously<00:01:59.640> such<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> large

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
now that there is obviously such a large

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.300 
now that there is obviously such a large
amount<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.960> people<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.290> want<00:02:01.979> those<00:02:02.100> kinds
