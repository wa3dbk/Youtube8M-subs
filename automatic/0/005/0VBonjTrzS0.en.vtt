all<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:00.960> part<00:00:01.290> four<00:00:02.480> let's<00:00:03.480> review<00:00:03.600> what<00:00:03.929> we

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
all right part four let's review what we

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.220 
all right part four let's review what we
learn<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.470> part<00:00:04.680> three<00:00:04.950> which<00:00:05.750> was<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
learn in part three which was the and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.580 
learn in part three which was the and
gate<00:00:08.240> which<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.420> three<00:00:09.630> blocks<00:00:12.290> torch<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
gate which is three blocks torch on the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.529 
gate which is three blocks torch on the
outside<00:00:18.500> torch<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> front<00:00:20.150> red<00:00:21.150> stone<00:00:21.449> in

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
outside torch on the front red stone in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.120 
outside torch on the front red stone in
the<00:00:21.600> middle<00:00:22.279> output<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:24.590> input<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.769> either

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the middle output here input on either

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.460 
the middle output here input on either
of<00:00:26.460> these<00:00:26.640> two<00:00:26.910> blocks<00:00:27.180> either<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
of these two blocks either from the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
of these two blocks either from the
sides<00:00:29.000> or<00:00:30.000> from<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.359> back<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:32.270> then<00:00:33.270> it's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
sides or from the back and then it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.130 
sides or from the back and then it's
also<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.710> NAND<00:00:34.950> gate<00:00:35.450> if<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.750> don't<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
also the NAND gate if we don't have that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.310 
also the NAND gate if we don't have that
torch<00:00:37.500> though<00:00:38.960> what<00:00:39.960> we're<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
torch though what we're going to be

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.810 
torch though what we're going to be
learning<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.129> lesson<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:42.110> memory

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
learning about in this lesson is memory

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.450 
learning about in this lesson is memory
and<00:00:45.590> even<00:00:46.590> though<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> sounds<00:00:47.100> complicated

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and even though it sounds complicated

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.450 
and even though it sounds complicated
it's<00:00:48.140> actually<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.260> too<00:00:49.500> bad<00:00:51.199> basically<00:00:52.460> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it's actually not too bad basically the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
it's actually not too bad basically the
easiest<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.390> memory<00:00:54.890> it's<00:00:55.890> what's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
easiest way to do memory it's what's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.049 
easiest way to do memory it's what's
called<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> RS<00:00:57.210> nor<00:00:57.480> latch<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:59.059> basically

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
called the RS nor latch and basically

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.020 
called the RS nor latch and basically
it's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.870> gate<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> output

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
it's a not gate that has the output

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.539 
it's a not gate that has the output
going<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:07.250> another<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.549> gate<00:01:09.979> that<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.220> its

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
going into another not gate that has its

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.750 
going into another not gate that has its
output<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> input<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.490> first

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
output going to the input of the first

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.020 
output going to the input of the first
mount<00:01:15.000> gate<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:16.070> completes<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> circle<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
mount gate so completes the circle to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.590 
mount gate so completes the circle to
knock<00:01:18.210> dates<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> make<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.880> four

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
knock dates you can make one with four

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.219 
knock dates you can make one with four
or<00:01:21.990> six<00:01:22.560> any<00:01:22.830> even<00:01:23.250> number<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> honestly<00:01:24.780> why

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
or six any even number but honestly why

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.420 
or six any even number but honestly why
bother<00:01:25.909> because<00:01:27.799> usually<00:01:28.799> you're<00:01:29.100> trying<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bother because usually you're trying to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.130 
bother because usually you're trying to
conserve<00:01:29.700> space<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
conserve space this is going to be the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
conserve space this is going to be the
easiest<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.310> memory<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:35.479> basically

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
easiest way to make memory and basically

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649 
easiest way to make memory and basically
this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:38.119> pretty<00:01:39.119> much<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> be

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
this is a pretty much going to be

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:49.010 
this is a pretty much going to be
necessary<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:41.540> any<00:01:42.540> use<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> buttons<00:01:48.020> because

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
necessary for any use of buttons because

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.880 
necessary for any use of buttons because
buttons<00:01:49.500> only<00:01:50.070> last<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.579> about<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.090> second<00:01:51.890> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
buttons only last for about a second but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
buttons only last for about a second but
as<00:01:53.009> you'll<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.939> r<00:01:54.240> RS<00:01:55.170> nor

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
as you'll see what this not r RS nor

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
as you'll see what this not r RS nor
latch<00:01:56.840> when<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> hit<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> button<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:59.450> turned

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
latch when I hit the button it turned

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.050 
latch when I hit the button it turned
this<00:02:00.630> torch<00:02:00.930> off<00:02:01.170> let's<00:02:02.159> turn<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> wire<00:02:02.729> off

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this torch off let's turn the wire off

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.569 
this torch off let's turn the wire off
which<00:02:03.810> made<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.560> torch<00:02:04.860> able<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.369> turned

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
which made this torch able to be turned

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.440 
which made this torch able to be turned
on<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.170> now<00:02:07.170> there's<00:02:07.409> power<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.160> there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
on and now there's power going in there

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.589 
on and now there's power going in there
so<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.520> cycled<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
so it just kind of cycled it to the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.910 
so it just kind of cycled it to the
other<00:02:12.810> state<00:02:14.090> which<00:02:15.090> allows<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:16.440> output

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
other state which allows the output

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.660 
other state which allows the output
coming<00:02:17.220> off<00:02:17.459> either<00:02:18.019> here<00:02:19.019> or<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:20.099> any<00:02:20.489> of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
coming off either here or here in any of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.520 
coming off either here or here in any of
these<00:02:20.760> directions<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.690> come<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:22.019> there<00:02:22.260> can

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
these directions can come out there can

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.490 
these directions can come out there can
come<00:02:22.680> out<00:02:22.709> there<00:02:22.980> could<00:02:23.190> come<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
come out there could come out there to

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500 
come out there could come out there to
be<00:02:25.680> constantly<00:02:26.519> providing<00:02:26.730> power<00:02:27.120> even

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
be constantly providing power even

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.990 
be constantly providing power even
though<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> button<00:02:28.170> let<00:02:29.160> me<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.430> click<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
though the button let me get click and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800 
though the button let me get click and
then<00:02:30.840> reset<00:02:31.319> itself<00:02:31.620> after<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.010> second<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
then reset itself after a second and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.030 
then reset itself after a second and
then<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.040> other<00:02:35.069> block<00:02:36.680> that's<00:02:37.680> going<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
then on the other block that's going to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.539 
then on the other block that's going to
function<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.739> reset<00:02:40.739> basically<00:02:41.310> it's

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
function as the reset basically it's

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.009 
function as the reset basically it's
going<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.890> cycle<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> nor<00:02:44.269> lot<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.569> RS<00:02:45.840> nor

going to cycle the nor lot the RS nor

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.210 
going to cycle the nor lot the RS nor
latch<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:47.099> its<00:02:47.250> other<00:02:47.430> state<00:02:48.590> input<00:02:49.590> could<00:02:50.010> be

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
latch to its other state input could be

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.470 
latch to its other state input could be
coming<00:02:50.519> off<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.090> here<00:02:51.599> or<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:53.269> any<00:02:54.269> of

coming off here or here or here any of
these<00:02:54.599> ways<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.769> going<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> work<00:02:56.280> oh<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.810> guess

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
these ways it's going to work oh I guess

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.300 
these ways it's going to work oh I guess
it<00:02:58.260> can't<00:02:58.440> come<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:58.680> there<00:02:58.890> otherwise<00:02:59.099> it

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
it can't come out there otherwise it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.979 
it can't come out there otherwise it
won't<00:02:59.459> connect<00:02:59.790> yeah<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.690> come<00:03:00.870> out

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
won't connect yeah so it can come out

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:10.069 
won't connect yeah so it can come out
either<00:03:01.709> those<00:03:02.040> two<00:03:02.280> ways<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:08.480> basically<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
either those two ways so basically you

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.860 
either those two ways so basically you
know<00:03:10.170> one<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> buttons<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:11.069> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.870> come

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
know one of the buttons is going to come

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.090 
know one of the buttons is going to come
out<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.049> here<00:03:13.410> probably<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.930> odd<00:03:16.109> provide

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
out of here probably that's odd provide

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.890 
out of here probably that's odd provide
power<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.489> add<00:03:17.700> or<00:03:18.590> something<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:20.900> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
power to add or something like that and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.559 
power to add or something like that and
then<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.739> could<00:03:22.889> have<00:03:23.819> either<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.150> button<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
then you could have either a button to

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.750 
then you could have either a button to
reset<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.470> door<00:03:25.620> closes<00:03:26.160> again<00:03:26.280> or

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
reset it so the door closes again or

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.250 
reset it so the door closes again or
maybe<00:03:26.790> have<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.420> hooked<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> pressure

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
maybe have this hooked up to a pressure

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
maybe have this hooked up to a pressure
plate<00:03:28.790> which<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.819> common<00:03:30.299> thing<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.510> way<00:03:30.840> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
plate which is common thing that way you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.390 
plate which is common thing that way you
don't<00:03:31.079> actually<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.530> aim<00:03:31.889> at<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.190> little

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
don't actually have to aim at the little

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.050 
don't actually have to aim at the little
button<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.480> be<00:03:33.569> hard<00:03:33.750> sometimes<00:03:35.060> so

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
button that can be hard sometimes so

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.069 
button that can be hard sometimes so
that<00:03:36.239> would<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.870> turn<00:03:37.829> on<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.130> door<00:03:39.079> but

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
that would you know turn on the door but

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.360 
that would you know turn on the door but
on<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> inside<00:03:40.380> would<00:03:40.859> turn<00:03:41.040> off<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.400> door

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
on the inside would turn off the door

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.580 
on the inside would turn off the door
it's<00:03:44.370> pretty<00:03:44.639> pretty<00:03:45.420> simple<00:03:47.930> once<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.049> know

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
it's pretty pretty simple once you know

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.500 
it's pretty pretty simple once you know
how<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.769> do<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:53.510> that's<00:03:54.510> how<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.870> do<00:03:55.170> that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
how to do it so that's how to do that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.190 
how to do it so that's how to do that
now<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:57.780> we<00:03:58.079> take<00:03:58.109> our<00:03:58.769> same<00:03:59.690> kind<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.750> chaining

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
now if we take our same kind of chaining

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.160 
now if we take our same kind of chaining
nor<00:04:01.859> latches<00:04:02.370> together<00:04:02.970> or<00:04:03.480> chaining<00:04:03.989> not

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
nor latches together or chaining not

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.539 
nor latches together or chaining not
gates<00:04:04.440> together<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:06.299> do<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:07.220> with<00:04:08.220> an<00:04:08.340> odd

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
gates together and we do it with an odd

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.460 
gates together and we do it with an odd
number<00:04:11.870> basically<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:12.989> not<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.380> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
number basically it's not going to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.860 
number basically it's not going to
maintain<00:04:14.310> state<00:04:14.639> it's<00:04:14.849> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.090> constantly

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
maintain state it's going to constantly

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.719 
maintain state it's going to constantly
cycle<00:04:16.349> States<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.609> let<00:04:17.789> me

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
cycle States so let me

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:26.640 
cycle States so let me
throw<00:04:19.729> another<00:04:20.060> not<00:04:21.019> gate<00:04:21.320> over<00:04:21.590> here<00:04:23.080> like<00:04:24.080> so

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.290 

hook<00:04:27.650> up<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.889> Redstone<00:04:28.370> no<00:04:28.729> that'll<00:04:29.150> turn

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
hook up the Redstone no that'll turn

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.120 
hook up the Redstone no that'll turn
that<00:04:29.479> one<00:04:29.660> off<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:31.310> one<00:04:31.520> will<00:04:31.639> be<00:04:31.669> fine<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that one off that one will be fine and

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.680 
that one off that one will be fine and
come<00:04:34.130> out<00:04:34.280> here<00:04:35.350> look<00:04:36.350> at<00:04:36.470> cycle<00:04:36.979> like<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.310> oh

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
come out here look at cycle like that oh

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.159 
come out here look at cycle like that oh
that's<00:04:38.690> pretty<00:04:39.220> now<00:04:40.220> eventually<00:04:41.169> the

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
that's pretty now eventually the

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.650 
that's pretty now eventually the
redstone<00:04:42.560> torches<00:04:42.949> get<00:04:43.190> worn<00:04:43.699> out<00:04:43.880> because

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
redstone torches get worn out because

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.400 
redstone torches get worn out because
there's<00:04:44.840> only<00:04:44.960> three<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.410> them<00:04:46.660> four<00:04:47.660> o'clock

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
there's only three of them four o'clock

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.659 
there's only three of them four o'clock
as<00:04:48.770> this<00:04:49.160> is<00:04:49.340> referred<00:04:49.699> to<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:50.780> be<00:04:50.900> stable<00:04:51.669> it

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
as this is referred to to be stable it

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.180 
as this is referred to to be stable it
has<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.060> have<00:04:53.380> at<00:04:54.380> least<00:04:54.620> five<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:57.740> gates<00:04:58.039> in

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
has to have at least five not gates in

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:09.279 
has to have at least five not gates in
it<00:05:02.470> twitch<00:05:03.470> um<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:07.720> kind<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:08.780> ran<00:05:08.900> out<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.110> space

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
it twitch um so kind of ran out of space

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.129 
it twitch um so kind of ran out of space
but<00:05:09.830> will<00:05:10.419> cheat<00:05:11.419> basically<00:05:13.870> come<00:05:14.870> out<00:05:15.110> of

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
but will cheat basically come out of

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.909 
but will cheat basically come out of
there<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:17.930> that's<00:05:18.139> a<00:05:18.289> stable<00:05:18.650> clock<00:05:20.919> not

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
there so that's a stable clock not

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.100 
there so that's a stable clock not
really<00:05:22.300> constructed<00:05:23.300> in<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:23.449> best<00:05:23.960> way

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
really constructed in the best way

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:33.240 
really constructed in the best way
possible<00:05:24.639> but<00:05:28.720> yeah<00:05:29.720> um<00:05:30.409> that<00:05:31.330> allows<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.599> to

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
possible but yeah um that allows you to

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.159 
possible but yeah um that allows you to
maybe<00:05:34.250> change<00:05:34.639> something<00:05:35.120> off<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.270> here<00:05:38.139> set<00:05:39.139> a

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
maybe change something off of here set a

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:47.129 
maybe change something off of here set a
door<00:05:39.409> down<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:42.020> want<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.289> be<00:05:42.380> really<00:05:42.620> annoying

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:57.360 

cycling<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:55.270> useful<00:05:56.270> thing<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.509> do<00:05:56.720> with<00:05:56.870> this

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
cycling a useful thing to do with this

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.450 
cycling a useful thing to do with this
is<00:05:58.370> uh<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:59.419> think<00:05:59.900> I'll<00:06:00.169> save<00:06:00.919> it<00:06:00.949> for<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.250> next

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
is uh I think I'll save it for the next

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.749 
is uh I think I'll save it for the next
part<00:06:03.250> but<00:06:04.250> there's<00:06:04.400> a<00:06:04.460> latch<00:06:04.669> called<00:06:05.030> a<00:06:05.409> toggle

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
part but there's a latch called a toggle

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.930 
part but there's a latch called a toggle
basically<00:06:07.759> when<00:06:07.940> it<00:06:08.060> changes<00:06:08.509> states<00:06:09.789> then<00:06:10.789> it

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
basically when it changes states then it

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.159 
basically when it changes states then it
either<00:06:11.060> turns<00:06:11.419> on<00:06:11.690> or<00:06:12.110> off<00:06:13.030> essentially<00:06:14.169> every

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
either turns on or off essentially every

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.240 
either turns on or off essentially every
time<00:06:15.409> every<00:06:16.400> two<00:06:17.090> times<00:06:17.360> this<00:06:17.690> cycles<00:06:18.250> the

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
time every two times this cycles the

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.210 
time every two times this cycles the
output<00:06:19.639> on<00:06:19.729> the<00:06:19.759> toggle<00:06:20.030> would<00:06:20.300> cycle<00:06:20.509> once<00:06:21.220> if

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
output on the toggle would cycle once if

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.589 
output on the toggle would cycle once if
you<00:06:22.370> change<00:06:22.639> those<00:06:22.759> together<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:23.419> can

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
you change those together you can

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:28.800 
you change those together you can
basically<00:06:23.810> make<00:06:25.270> very<00:06:26.270> simple<00:06:26.659> binary<00:06:27.260> clocks

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
basically make very simple binary clocks

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.370 
basically make very simple binary clocks
that<00:06:29.440> would<00:06:29.710> you<00:06:30.160> know<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:31.510> ones<00:06:31.750> digit<00:06:32.020> would

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
that would you know the ones digit would

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.330 
that would you know the ones digit would
change<00:06:32.710> and<00:06:33.160> then<00:06:33.340> you<00:06:33.910> know<00:06:34.030> when<00:06:34.480> it<00:06:35.340> cycled

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
change and then you know when it cycled

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.490 
change and then you know when it cycled
twice<00:06:36.730> then<00:06:37.090> the<00:06:37.270> the<00:06:37.810> two<00:06:37.990> digit<00:06:38.230> would

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
twice then the the two digit would

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.200 
twice then the the two digit would
change<00:06:38.830> then<00:06:39.160> when<00:06:39.280> that<00:06:39.400> cycle<00:06:39.790> twice<00:06:39.970> the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
change then when that cycle twice the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.379 
change then when that cycle twice the
four<00:06:40.419> digit<00:06:40.630> would<00:06:40.900> change<00:06:41.200> and<00:06:41.880> and<00:06:42.880> so<00:06:43.060> forth

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
four digit would change and and so forth

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.820 
four digit would change and and so forth
so<00:06:43.889> that's<00:06:44.889> a<00:06:45.100> simple<00:06:45.400> way<00:06:45.639> to<00:06:45.669> make<00:06:45.910> a<00:06:45.940> binary

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
so that's a simple way to make a binary

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.970 
so that's a simple way to make a binary
clock<00:06:47.830> that<00:06:48.780> counts<00:06:49.780> up<00:06:50.070> basically<00:06:51.450> i<00:06:52.740> think<00:06:53.740> i

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
clock that counts up basically i think i

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.890 
clock that counts up basically i think i
will<00:06:54.040> show<00:06:54.700> you<00:06:54.760> how<00:06:54.940> to<00:06:55.150> do<00:06:55.360> those<00:06:55.540> toggles

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
will show you how to do those toggles

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.659 
will show you how to do those toggles
next<00:06:56.830> time<00:06:57.600> until<00:06:58.600> then<00:06:59.220> maybe<00:07:00.220> try<00:07:00.520> and

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
next time until then maybe try and

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.700 
next time until then maybe try and
incorporate<00:07:01.000> some<00:07:01.389> RS<00:07:01.660> nor<00:07:01.840> latch<00:07:01.900> a--'s<00:07:02.320> into

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
incorporate some RS nor latch a--'s into

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.250 
incorporate some RS nor latch a--'s into
your<00:07:02.860> systems<00:07:03.250> and<00:07:03.990> if<00:07:04.990> you<00:07:05.110> have<00:07:05.229> any

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
your systems and if you have any
