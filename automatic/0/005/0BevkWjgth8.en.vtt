00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 spinal is finally here 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.940
 many waited partly due 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.980
 of the roster enough offers lied of 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.600
 new killer instinct and partly because 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.680
 the developers had promised that the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.110
 his arrival would have reshuffled 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.239
 notably the cards on the table do not 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.890
 this pile of bones are proven wrong and 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.110
 very bad is different from all 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.340
 not only other characters is perhaps the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.840
 fighter more difficult to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.699
 master of the title that today 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.559
 we will try to explain to you why 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.660
 let's start from the peculiarities of the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.460
 character many of you will not know 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.019
 but all the characters of killer instinct 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.449
 have some uniqueness in the management 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.979
 of combos or special moves 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.810
 espana makes no difference 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.370
 indeed it makes a difference in the sense that yes 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.560
 perhaps it is the most unique warrior of 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.390
 beat the whole spinal strategy 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.670
 share around the ability to generate 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.560
 skulls these are obtainable with one 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.970
 taking complete combinations with lots 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.650
 of finisher or executing a deal 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.510
 special call devours energy to the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.950
 moment of opponent's attack without 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.320
 skulls the skeleton is not a threat 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.210
 particularly dangerous but left 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.369
 it comes to generate someone and will put back in 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.930
 very serious difficulties not only in fact, 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.370
 what huskies allow him to hurl 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.290
 some of the firewalls more effective than 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.540
 game but they are also consumable for 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.740
 enhance some moves and make them safe 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.150
 of attack strategies that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.980
 normally they would leave it very 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.120
 discovered we start right from the bullets 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.160
 siren's cannes 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.080
 these not only have a remarkable air 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.970
 but they are designed to encourage mix ups 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.860
 that is attacks capable of confusing 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.290
 the opponent since coming from more 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 directions with his year a spinal skull 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.740
 can launch a low or medium firewall 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.450
 even throw one over the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.800
 head of the enemy and get to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.530
 reach his bullets with one 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.460
 convenient single run very fast 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.690
 it can also be deleted in a move 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 special 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.170
 in practice launch your firewalls 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.450
 chase and then attack the enemy 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.190
 from where he does not expect it to favor 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.720
 this unpredictable chaotic aspect of the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.340
 character and double helix have it 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.690
 even equipped with three teleports 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.150
 classics and a live kick 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.430
 in plain terms until skulls were fired 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.470
 understanding where it will hit you is a drama e 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.180
 even iteleport are upgradeable with 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.819
 the skulls and cancel the recovery if 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.379
 consumed to offset this 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.180
 extreme unpredictability and double helix 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.700
 they have given the character normally the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.349
 relatively scarce except for a very good one 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.220
 pending from the middle distance and in the 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.020
 quick shots 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.540
 average spa nun norman by haul 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.820
 exaggerated and incredibly fast tip 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.410
 all about its special ergo mechanics 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.930
 at the beginning of the match and deprived of his texts 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.610
 the need for is also in difficulty 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.470
 often vary the mode continuously 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.020
 d assault makes a character spiral 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.880
 for experts to exploit simple strategies 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.860
 and it's safe not enough to risk 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.170
 game start and accumulate advantage 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.660
 just for this spinal also another 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.100
 annoying curses ability 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.720
 in practice, complete the combinations 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.940
 with certain moves or hitting 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.100
 the opponent with a serial can create a 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.510
 fatuous fire blue yellow the blue consumes 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.670
 shadow indicator while yellow 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.560
 instinct the energy consumed passes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.240
 directly to spinal allowing him to 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.740
 use but if you shadow more often or 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.660
 keep the powerful longer active 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.550
 extinct mode in which of course 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.350
 it fills up with skulls and is a danger 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.820
 pressing are the bass going 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.500
 best exploited to maintain a 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.390
 constant advantage during the match e 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.070
 maximize the damage whose usefulness 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.050
 greater lies in the capacity of 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.790
 limit the enemy offensive as well as 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.230
 improve yours 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.670
 in short, spain is a council 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.740
 the killer roster is stratospheric 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 hinting and actually does all that 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.670
 that the developers had promised the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
 his style is fundamentally different from 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.000
 that of all the other warriors 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.680
 requires considerable reasoning is practical 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.750
 and gives all the competition a boost 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.400
 online hard to tell how many players 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.840
 will be able to make the notes of the resound 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.160
 pirates come out dead on the face of the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.690
 enemies in the coming months 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.489
 but if the killer instinct junta will be 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.140
 all of this level well means 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.459
 that there are good reasons to keep 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.580
 an eye on this beat a lot a 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.580
 long
