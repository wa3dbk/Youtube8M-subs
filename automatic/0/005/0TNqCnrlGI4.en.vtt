00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.980
 15 let's be like this kaleidoscope a 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.960
 life in balance represent that all 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.509
 the edges all sides all 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.119
 angles see how they are turning and let's be 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.999
 this the focal point then when you 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:19.269
 you concentrate and you see that center means 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:22.150
 the power of resolution how many lives 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.279
 They went well when classmates got married 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.140
 they fell in love bayern and it turned out that 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.320
 after the year of the years it was not what 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.730
 that it was expected all this indicates a 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.410
 keyword that is always in 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.810
 women find out in the other program what 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.780
 we have said what happens you stopped 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.780
 admire was worth everything you stopped praising not 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.090
 matter nothing you stopped recognizing less 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.700
 you stopped praising, you stopped thanking and 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.460
 you stopped entering into cosmic gratitude and 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.580
 is the word history not because of me anymore 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.050
 There is gratitude, it's over, you were not talking 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.030
 you admire what you expect 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.010
 just where is the balance the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.900
 balance already be us and that is a 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.970
 another program's theme and bet it would be 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.000
 very good place what is called the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.070
 biorhythms how many times are we related 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 nothing more in the carnal and schalke missing a 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.750
 factor in enough things 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.180
 emotions outside astral no thoughts 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.640
 equal no intuition or spirituality does not 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.159
 illustrative new superior love there was no 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.380
 will there was no passion and wisdom nor 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.330
 insight or expertise or anything all 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.220
 because they are simply missing 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.289
 values I believe that the power of the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.390
 prayer truly the power of the 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.640
 Concord says it's like that in the name of the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.220
 victorious mother presence I invoke you from 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.159
 all concord equity and harmony in 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.200
 that in me the power of the 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.330
 acceptance of recognition of 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.360
 spoken word that you can hear 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.310
 tolerate being patient and discerning everything 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 what I can hear feeling 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.780
 praise and possess because really 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.179
 our faults are the five senses and 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.479
 what are they we know lack 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.060
 one and the sixth sense in intuition 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.429
 that is the main fault in all 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.709
 we let ourselves be carried away by what 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.840
 they say more not because of what they feel and 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.940
 finally as I explained when the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.369
 thought feel and heart think 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.190
 that's called pnl and programming 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.380
 neurolinguistics is that we can talk 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.710
 neuronally and the dendrites that is 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.170
 the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.440
 are going to be synapses are going to be a 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.960
 true click or cosmic connection and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.360
 then we will be able to better understand 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.590
 others all the time of divorce and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.960
 separations is because really 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.810
 we started to negotiate ourselves 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.880
 we started to separate ourselves from us and the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.040
 fall of a man and civilizations 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.200
 from the past is that we really left 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.300
 carry for desires and passions and eyes that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.120
 it's temporary and true love so 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.010
 except that is immortal or permanent and in 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.020
 the moment when we when 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 we started a relationship let's say that that 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.420
 concord is soul mate is illustrative 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.030
 etcetera be immanent and permanent I think 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.180
 that's where we're really going to 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.460
 reach like this center a true 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.690
 unification and there is the power of God in 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.690
 that life and let's help
