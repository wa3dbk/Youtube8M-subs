00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.240
 and you see the google nexus five that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.010
 already in November 2013 it came out 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.349
 first only a play store available 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.910
 but it was still when it was now 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 a few months later look at that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.400
 Let's get back to it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.140
 because devices are only cheaper that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 means one or the other of you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.610
 probably still has that before 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 device to buy here first the 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.810
 packaging is kept beautiful blue too 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.739
 No matter actually we have but we see here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.780
 nexus five she's just like 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 at the nexus four we have here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.120
 vereing lg device does not take that out 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.980
 the packaging of her we see 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 the white edition was already there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.319
 said by some that's ugly 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.640
 or the back or the white 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.420
 color certainly does not look that way 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.039
 My opinion is beautiful 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.920
 actually that I find it okay 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 Of course, there are more stylish devices 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.309
 but there are far more violent devices where 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.219
 You can really say that here you are 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.430
 simply in the know that red device I have 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.350
 Otherwise, they are cool 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 find and black, of course 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.210
 Of course, it's still a matter of taste 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.310
 I wanted here in the end so yes 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.229
 here in white where you first from the outside 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 from what you naturally notice when you 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.990
 here the back looks we have 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.079
 not here like the predecessor one 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.649
 glass back he also already the 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.359
 Often with colleagues of mine shattered 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.299
 is when after falling down but 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.890
 we have polycarbonate here otherwise 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.500
 especially natural that the device with 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 android chains equipped naturally 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.670
 what is now other appliances made 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.420
 already at that time it was the first one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 kit kat had android 4.4 point 4.2 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 we have the latest here now 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.250
 update and we'll see you soon 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.909
 times to which measures I 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.070
 at all we have her 138 mm x 69 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.560
 millimeter my nine millimeter at the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.899
 thickest point is so pretty 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.759
 actually thin and you can tell that too 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.740
 if you have that in your hand 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.890
 one notices first of all that that is one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.690
 it's pretty light already weighs 132 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.850
 gram 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.410
 But somehow you feel pretty 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.900
 good in the hand of the size of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.610
 So it's pretty cool 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 there are devices that I have a lot 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.870
 wider are the htc evo at max and 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270
 Angus how can you really keep that up ? 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.190
 feel the pants pocket so if you from 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.160
 on the outside we see above 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 the 35 mm jack for headphones on the 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.300
 on the right side we have this on 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.750
 switch or this looks like a break 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.440
 key next to it in slot for the micro sim 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.180
 card because that belongs here because you can 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.950
 we do not lose weight here any 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.900
 acute goes to lose weight that was when 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.970
 predecessor not so but since we are here 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.280
 only one there for the micro SIM card 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.960
 we no longer have a state that means something 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.820
 we also can not do the storage 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.730
 expand 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.160
 yes then we will find speakers 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.080
 and microphone input for the micro 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.370
 usb cable on the left side we have 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.210
 here the volume seesaw behind 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.220
 you here 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.640
 the camera what we have for a camera 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.810
 an 8 megapixel camera and nexus stands 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.959
 here in front we have the front camera the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.800
 earcup and the display so to speak that 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.110
 first to the pure outer then look 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.390
 we'll be brief in the scope of delivery 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.380
 so that you can see what is here 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.640
 device is relatively cheap the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.440
 next devices are actually always 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.030
 pretty cheap and that falls mainly 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.250
 when accessories on the have me once 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.900
 the manual of course then 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.660
 here is a tool to the micro-sim card 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.489
 get out as you can see 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.150
 works like the iphone, then 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.769
 here the data cable micro usb and usb 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.510
 we have the adapter for the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.640
 outlet and that was it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.440
 So a relatively small supply 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.560
 we have seen no headphones here 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.510
 you have to organize it yourself 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.090
 and so on, you usually do it like that 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.330
 then we have the battery here natural 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.310
 firmly installed as he told me a 2300th 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.960
 milliamp batteries a lithium 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.630
 ion 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.570
 Battery we have here according to manufacturer 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.160
 possibility in standby mode up to 300 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.070
 to endure hours if you 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.170
 phoned the 17 hours persevere 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.730
 the device then internal memory 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.710
 integrated you can not expand like 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.190
 because we do not have a slot here 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.510
 a micro sd card that's what I often mean 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.770
 either the 16gb variant or the 32nd 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.190
 gb variant 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.410
 and that makes a little 30 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.550
 difference actually only 16 costs so 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.670
 roughly 380 379 euro you find under 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.830
 on www handy deutschland.de 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.300
 for the price you can go to more 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.080
 compare phones and so on and so on 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.510
 As always, look at the 16 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.510
 Gigabyte version is currently available 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.690
 example not in the places only the 32 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.570
 gigabyte variant costs 400 euros 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.340
 this still exists the first impression 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.850
 is first that the device is relative 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.430
 Chic I think that looks good 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.770
 the back is of course one 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.560
 matter of taste but I think it looks 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.800
 good looking is good in the hand from the front 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.380
 So I think it looks really cool 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.770
 from so nexus devices I like 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.420
 actually always very good 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.860
 I do not always like lg devices though 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.780
 the next devices with the pure google 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.270
 I think first of the purely external 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.680
 cool and like the whole one now 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.400
 looks like look now 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.170
 right away 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.560
 we drive the money up and 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.270
 look how kitkat looks like what we do 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.620
 to have 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.770
 Of course, pure google always means 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.150
 that he is pure so find the one here 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.650
 no frills from it 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.160
 installed by the manufacturer and so on 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.010
 and so on 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.020
 as with HTC, for example , Gdansk knew 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.640
 manufacturers apps we catch that 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.510
 device up and show in the next part 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.510
 I give you the service
