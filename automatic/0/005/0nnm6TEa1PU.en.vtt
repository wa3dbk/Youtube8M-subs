and gentlemen he's putting something

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.760

amplifier that which we will call it a

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.020 
amplifier that which we will call it a
double<00:01:50.110> we're<00:01:50.830> not<00:01:50.950> saying<00:01:51.130> it's<00:01:51.280> replacing<00:01:51.760> a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
double we're not saying it's replacing a

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.200 
double we're not saying it's replacing a
dumble<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.710> we're<00:01:53.950> saying<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.430> with<00:01:55.000> a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
dumble but we're saying that with a

may<00:02:04.300> be<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.450> bold<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.870> can<00:02:04.990> say<00:02:05.140> that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
may be so bold we can say that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.039 
may be so bold we can say that
you<00:02:07.659> can<00:02:07.840> engage<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.470> pedal<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.970> jetter<00:02:10.479> G

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
you can engage this pedal this jetter G

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.030 
you can engage this pedal this jetter G
120<00:02:11.920> for<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:13.239> particular<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:14.350> letter<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
120 for that particular a letter and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.740 
120 for that particular a letter and
number<00:02:15.250> combination<00:02:15.910> apparently<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
number combination apparently is the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.100 
number combination apparently is the
name<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.380> Dumble<00:02:17.860> circuit<00:02:18.810> allows<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.019> to

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
name of a Dumble circuit allows you to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.130 
name of a Dumble circuit allows you to
get<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.500> Dumble<00:02:20.950> ish<00:02:21.310> tone<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.360> what<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.720> is

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
get the Dumble ish tone and what that is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.030 
get the Dumble ish tone and what that is
is<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:24.070> squishes<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:24.850> sustains<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> way<00:02:26.040> when

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
is it squishes it sustains in a way when

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.860 
is it squishes it sustains in a way when
you<00:02:27.070> back<00:02:27.370> off<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.180> actual<00:02:28.570> attack

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you back off on just the actual attack

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.780 
you back off on just the actual attack
it<00:02:29.080> cleans<00:02:29.380> up<00:02:29.590> when<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.860> lean<00:02:30.070> into<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.459> it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it cleans up when you lean into it it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.030 
it cleans up when you lean into it it
has<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.269> sustain<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.049> creamy<00:02:32.530> squish

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
has this sustain and this creamy squish

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.520 
has this sustain and this creamy squish
that<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.489> hard<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.330> define<00:02:34.510> but<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.140> know<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
that is hard to define but you know it

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.350 
that is hard to define but you know it
when<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.950> hear<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.580> play<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.850> when<00:02:37.239> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
when you hear it and play it when you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.539 
when you hear it and play it when you
actually<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.959> found<00:02:38.560> myself<00:02:38.769> having<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.340> back

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
actually I found myself having this back

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.050 
actually I found myself having this back
in<00:02:39.730> my<00:02:39.850> lair<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.390> last<00:02:40.570> three<00:02:40.810> nights<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.350> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
in my lair the last three nights and I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.460 
in my lair the last three nights and I
couldn't<00:02:43.060> stop<00:02:43.239> playing<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.690> because<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.350> just

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
couldn't stop playing it because it just

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.740 
couldn't stop playing it because it just
sounded<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:44.920> damn<00:02:45.250> juicy<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.090> had<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.570> little

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
sounded so damn juicy and I had a little

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
sounded so damn juicy and I had a little
Princeton<00:02:47.170> amp<00:02:47.320> on<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:48.070> one<00:02:48.549> or<00:02:48.790> two<00:02:48.970> because

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
Princeton amp on like one or two because

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.339 
Princeton amp on like one or two because
I<00:02:49.270> really<00:02:49.480> couldn't<00:02:49.599> crank<00:02:49.959> all<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.200> much

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
I really couldn't crank all that much

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.180 
I really couldn't crank all that much
but

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
but

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.250 
but
it's<00:02:51.700> not<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> glorious<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.630> anyway<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.200> is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it's not a glorious so anyway this is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.340 
it's not a glorious so anyway this is
