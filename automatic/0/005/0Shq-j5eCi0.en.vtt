sitting<00:00:30.869> outside<00:00:31.019> under<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> covered<00:00:32.340> roof<00:00:32.700> but

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
sitting outside under a covered roof but

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.860 
sitting outside under a covered roof but
still<00:00:33.390> outside<00:00:33.960> nonetheless<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.870> that's

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870

actually<00:00:37.200> working<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:37.829> favor<00:00:38.309> because

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
actually working out in my favor because

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
actually working out in my favor because
typically<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> pick<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.469> sheet

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
typically when you when I pick up sheet

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.229 
typically when you when I pick up sheet
goods<00:00:41.040> from<00:00:41.250> Lowe's<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.700> something<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> know

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
goods from Lowe's or something you know

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
goods from Lowe's or something you know
the<00:00:42.390> sheet<00:00:42.780> gets<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.079> stored<00:00:43.350> inside<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.370> once

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the sheet gets are stored inside so once

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.279 
the sheet gets are stored inside so once
I<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:45.059> them<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:46.200> my<00:00:46.350> shop<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:48.289> they

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
I get them into my shop then the they

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
I get them into my shop then the they
absorb<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> moisture<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> air<00:00:51.180> because

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
absorb the moisture in the air because

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
absorb the moisture in the air because
it's<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.110> less<00:00:52.829> humid<00:00:53.460> inside<00:00:53.879> low<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.329> well

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it's it's less humid inside low as well

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's it's less humid inside low as well
in<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.989> took<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.770> outside<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
in here I took it from outside to the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
in here I took it from outside to the
garage<00:00:57.180> doors<00:00:57.300> open<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.020> basically<00:00:58.530> outside

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
garage doors open so basically outside

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
garage doors open so basically outside
this<00:00:59.250> stuff<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> remaining<00:00:59.910> nice<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.629> stable

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this stuff is remaining nice and stable

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
this stuff is remaining nice and stable
while<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> work<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
while I work with it and then if it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
while I work with it and then if it
moves<00:01:03.809> after<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.589> put<00:01:04.799> together<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
moves after it's put together well it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
moves after it's put together well it's
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.820> much<00:01:06.030> smaller<00:01:06.420> pieces<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
going to be much smaller pieces by that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
going to be much smaller pieces by that
point<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.310> shouldn't<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.610> any<00:01:08.760> problems

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
point and I shouldn't have any problems

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.859 
point and I shouldn't have any problems

had<00:01:54.990> these<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.710> place<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.130> had<00:01:56.280> four<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.790> what

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
had these in place I had four on what

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
had these in place I had four on what
happened<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> third<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.869> think<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
happened to the third one I think I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.980 
happened to the third one I think I
chopped<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.070> something<00:01:59.219> else<00:01:59.399> but

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
chopped it up for something else but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.910 
chopped it up for something else but
what<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> did<00:02:01.200> before<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.469> left<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.860> just

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
what I did before I left is I just

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
what I did before I left is I just
screwed<00:02:02.369> three<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.240> two<00:02:03.930> befores

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
screwed three more of these two befores

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.520 
screwed three more of these two befores
this<00:02:04.530> way<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.310> had<00:02:06.060> pretty<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.020> support

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this way so I had pretty good support

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.010 
this way so I had pretty good support
the<00:02:07.890> whole<00:02:08.069> full<00:02:08.429> length<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the whole full length of this and I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660 
the whole full length of this and I
could<00:02:10.170> haul<00:02:10.349> full<00:02:10.679> eight-foot<00:02:11.190> sheet<00:02:11.430> goods

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
could haul full eight-foot sheet goods

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670 
could haul full eight-foot sheet goods
with<00:02:12.060> absolutely<00:02:12.540> no<00:02:12.720> problem

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
with absolutely no problem

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.020 
with absolutely no problem
and<00:02:13.799> loading<00:02:14.189> them<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.430> was<00:02:14.579> really<00:02:14.760> easy

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and loading them up was really easy

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.839 
and loading them up was really easy
because<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:17.040> slide<00:02:17.280> them<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.579> and

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
because of this just slide them on and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.839 
because of this just slide them on and
then<00:02:18.799> unloading<00:02:19.799> them<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.129> turned<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.700> truck

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
then unloading them I turned the truck

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.959 
then unloading them I turned the truck
around<00:02:21.090> backed<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.689> to<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.079> table<00:02:22.409> saw<00:02:22.969> sorry

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
around backed up to the table saw sorry

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.110 
around backed up to the table saw sorry
for<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.359> shaky<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.799> I<00:02:26.549> literally<00:02:26.819> just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
for it's so shaky and I literally just

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.869 
for it's so shaky and I literally just
slid<00:02:27.810> them<00:02:27.930> off<00:02:28.079> onto<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:29.519> slid

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
slid them off onto this and then slid

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.429 
slid them off onto this and then slid
him<00:02:30.000> onto<00:02:30.209> my<00:02:30.239> saw<00:02:30.569> horses<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.079> never<00:02:31.200> had<00:02:31.379> to

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
him onto my saw horses so I never had to

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.809 
him onto my saw horses so I never had to
pick<00:02:31.560> them<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.129> I<00:02:32.219> realized<00:02:32.549> well

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
pick them up and then I realized well

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.539 
pick them up and then I realized well
