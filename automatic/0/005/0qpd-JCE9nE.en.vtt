don't<00:02:17.580> think<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:19.190> no<00:02:21.410> right<00:02:22.410> unto<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.980> game

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
don't think so no right unto the game

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.630 
don't think so no right unto the game
then<00:02:23.720> yeah<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> said<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.260> said<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.920> talked<00:02:26.550> about

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
then yeah I said I said I talked about

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.360 
then yeah I said I said I talked about
why<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> haven't<00:02:27.240> been<00:02:27.390> playing<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.750> lot<00:02:28.370> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
why I haven't been playing a lot and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.840 
why I haven't been playing a lot and
because<00:02:29.760> also<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.480> holidays<00:02:31.850> I'm

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
because also because of the holidays I'm

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.290 
because also because of the holidays I'm
really<00:02:34.370> getting<00:02:35.370> laid<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> bed<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.150> getting

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
really getting laid to bed and getting

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.610 
really getting laid to bed and getting
laid<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.840> off<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.860> bed<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:39.390> o'clock<00:02:39.750> maybe<00:02:40.410> two

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
laid up off of bed one o'clock maybe two

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.780 
laid up off of bed one o'clock maybe two
o'clock<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.190> PM<00:02:44.360> 1pm<00:02:45.360> or<00:02:45.450> 2pm<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.020> get<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.790> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
o'clock in the PM 1pm or 2pm I get up so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.180 
o'clock in the PM 1pm or 2pm I get up so
that's<00:02:48.120> pretty<00:02:49.020> stupid<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:50.040> that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that's pretty stupid of me so that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's pretty stupid of me so that
that's<00:02:50.370> why<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.580> don't<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> lot<00:02:51.960> of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
that's why I don't have a lot of

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.520 
that's why I don't have a lot of
motivation<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.120> make<00:02:54.270> videos<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.990> stuff<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
motivation to make videos and stuff and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.360 
motivation to make videos and stuff and
i<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.250> i<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.460> small<00:02:56.610> cold<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:58.130> know<00:02:59.130> it's

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
i think i have a small cold I know it's

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.990 
i think i have a small cold I know it's
it<00:02:59.550> right<00:02:59.730> now<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.500> yea<00:03:01.500> unto<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.950> gun<00:03:02.160> at

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
it right now but yea unto the gun at

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.330 
it right now but yea unto the gun at
first<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:03.810> I've<00:03:03.960> played<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> last<00:03:04.590> week<00:03:04.920> I'll

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
first when I've played it last week I'll

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.400 
first when I've played it last week I'll
put<00:03:05.730> an<00:03:05.850> annotation<00:03:06.090> somewhere<00:03:06.570> or<00:03:06.900> link<00:03:07.290> in

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
put an annotation somewhere or link in

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.520 
put an annotation somewhere or link in
the<00:03:07.470> bottom<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.280> his<00:03:08.370> description<00:03:08.640> box<00:03:08.970> I

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the bottom for in his description box I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.470 
the bottom for in his description box I
really<00:03:10.530> didn't<00:03:10.770> like<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.070> gun<00:03:11.250> at<00:03:11.730> first<00:03:12.300> I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
really didn't like the gun at first I

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.830 
really didn't like the gun at first I
was<00:03:12.630> playing<00:03:12.870> with<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:14.300> instead<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.420> four<00:03:15.660> get

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
was playing with the instead of four get

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.760 
was playing with the instead of four get
with<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.400> once<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:17.550> cooled<00:03:18.320> G<00:03:19.320> target

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
with and once it's cooled G target

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.910 
with and once it's cooled G target
finder<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.080> well<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.110> don't<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.710> it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
finder I think and well I don't like it

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.040 
finder I think and well I don't like it
like<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> scope<00:03:24.270> or<00:03:24.510> whatever<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:24.960> called

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
like a scope or whatever it's called

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.210 
like a scope or whatever it's called
target<00:03:25.800> finder<00:03:26.210> red<00:03:27.210> dot<00:03:27.420> thingy<00:03:28.220> optical

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
target finder red dot thingy optical

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.250 
target finder red dot thingy optical
sight<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.460> really<00:03:29.790> don't<00:03:29.970> like<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.330> because<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
sight I really don't like it because the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.050 
sight I really don't like it because the
frame<00:03:31.590> everything<00:03:32.070> gets<00:03:32.700> smaller<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.510> stuff

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
frame everything gets smaller and stuff

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.150 
frame everything gets smaller and stuff
so<00:03:36.060> instead<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.600> throw<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.260> foregrip

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
so instead of that I throw on a foregrip

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.860 
so instead of that I throw on a foregrip
to<00:03:39.590> get<00:03:40.590> less<00:03:40.830> recoil<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:42.360> helped<00:03:42.690> and

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
to get less recoil and that helped and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.590 
to get less recoil and that helped and
when<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.890> firm<00:03:44.310> when<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.640> played<00:03:44.910> played<00:03:45.300> at<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
when I firm when I played played at the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.100 
when I firm when I played played at the
peg<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.440> his<00:03:46.560> gun<00:03:46.740> last<00:03:46.920> week<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:48.110> actually

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
peg with his gun last week I actually

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.030 
peg with his gun last week I actually
didn't<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.740> it<00:03:49.920> at<00:03:50.550> first<00:03:50.580> was<00:03:51.230> mad<00:03:52.230> yeah<00:03:52.680> why

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
didn't like it at first was mad yeah why

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.680 
didn't like it at first was mad yeah why
would<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.370> butt<00:03:53.580> cheek<00:03:54.060> home<00:03:54.240> or<00:03:54.420> whatever

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
would you butt cheek home or whatever

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.910 
would you butt cheek home or whatever
it's<00:03:54.840> called<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.800> better<00:03:57.470> better<00:03:58.470> recoil

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
it's called it's a better better recoil

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.030 
it's called it's a better better recoil
read<00:03:59.250> less<00:03:59.490> recoil<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.090> have<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.330> say<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:01.860> that's

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
read less recoil I have to say so that's

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.520 
read less recoil I have to say so that's
how<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.700> that's<00:04:02.940> gonna<00:04:03.320> easier<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
how it's that that's gonna easier to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.120 
how it's that that's gonna easier to
handle<00:04:04.850> but<00:04:05.850> after<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.330> while<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:07.620> kill<00:04:07.830> this

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
handle but after a while to kill this

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.340 
handle but after a while to kill this
game<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:09.800> went<00:04:11.000> itself<00:04:12.000> ever<00:04:12.240> so<00:04:12.540> yeah<00:04:13.320> I

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
game it just went itself ever so yeah I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.920 
game it just went itself ever so yeah I
was<00:04:13.620> going<00:04:14.220> pretty<00:04:14.580> pretty<00:04:14.850> pretty<00:04:15.390> well<00:04:15.630> I

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
was going pretty pretty pretty well I

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.150 
was going pretty pretty pretty well I
have<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.680> say<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:18.359> there<00:04:18.690> from<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.470> moment<00:04:19.709> I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
have to say and there from that moment I

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.210 
have to say and there from that moment I
start<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.030> gun<00:04:21.210> a<00:04:21.660> bit<00:04:22.020> more

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
start to like the gun a bit more

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.070 
start to like the gun a bit more
I<00:04:23.280> don't<00:04:23.700> know<00:04:23.820> even<00:04:23.940> if<00:04:24.330> i'm<00:04:24.480> going<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.750> use<00:04:24.930> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
I don't know even if i'm going to use it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.420 
I don't know even if i'm going to use it
more<00:04:25.740> often<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:27.410> yeah<00:04:28.410> after<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.010> while<00:04:29.160> it

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
more often but yeah after a while it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.490 
more often but yeah after a while it
just<00:04:29.460> flew<00:04:30.420> by<00:04:31.010> my<00:04:32.010> feeling<00:04:33.230> so<00:04:34.230> there<00:04:34.380> was<00:04:34.470> a

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
just flew by my feeling so there was a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.790 
just flew by my feeling so there was a
lot<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.740> fun<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.190> after<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.150> few<00:04:36.600> kills<00:04:37.530> I

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
lot of fun and after a few kills I

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.700 
lot of fun and after a few kills I
thought<00:04:38.070> do<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> have<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.660> select<00:04:39.990> fire<00:04:40.170> on<00:04:40.440> yes

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
thought do I have the select fire on yes
