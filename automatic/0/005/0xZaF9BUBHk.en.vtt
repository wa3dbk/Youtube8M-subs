00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello, good afternoon, we all have 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.250
 a news of last food a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.290
 self-cleaning shirt and day syllables 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 well the truth is that one hundred days 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.009
 syllables because already entered by what it says 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.990
 for the eyes good a story a little more 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.000
 to a company called the word 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.279
 prince and good has created a kind of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.199
 gentleman shirt only and good 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.630
 he says he does not need what is the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 base that type of shirts because I do not know 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 he needs to wash because he tells us that they have 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
 participated in numerous companies and that he has 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 cost a lot what to figure out the type 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 of wool that they have used for that shirt and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 well says that wool is exclusive 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 for that shirt and good says also that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.590
 you do not need what on my iron or 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 wash and German does not smell or wrinkle 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 neither the truth is that this to a great 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.410
 invention for gentlemen because 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.420
 They imagined that I was going on a trip 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 example that I know on either side of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 world and they do not have what a shirt is and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.449
 have to wash law such and such because 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.670
 this shirt as there are different colors 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.100
 so also with stripes with squares 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.360
 ovens and so you can put a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.510
 shirt one day another day and already 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.910
 for example 100 plus 100 200 days with that 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.370
 he no longer needs another type of shirt 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.950
 I would regret well that I invented what they are 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.350
 the good shoes and shoes 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.330
 aside the pants and already more complete 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.130
 you do not need to wash and the truth is that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.729
 quite interesting also highlight 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.000
 that it also depends a lot on what is the 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.250
 sense of each person and the hygiene of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.380
 that person also depends on that thing 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.270
 and if you use deodorant then you can 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.060
 stain they are already putting the knob 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.280
 because in principle they said no 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.240
 It was necessary to wash and now he says 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.090
 that you have to have a hygiene 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.210
 body and such that is also going 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.790
 removing that I point in that sense and 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.680
 Well, well, imagine if you're a guy 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.140
 of cotton better if it was harder 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.810
 cotton imagine it was a little more 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 a little more what is said thick what 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
 is the cotton you will imagine as if 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.530
 it was a cardboard I say because if it is 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.600
 better what the cotton you can see be 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.300
 a little harder what tissue is 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.470
 is more hard tissue and says that what 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.270
 also 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.460
 this company invented what are the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.260
 cases and deodorant arrivals that if by 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.240
 example, a rogue hits you then 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.250
 it stays what it is on TV already of 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.140
 underpants and stays there what they are 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.240
 the gases and does not transpire the truth that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.460
 it's quite interesting and I the only thing 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.440
 What I think about this is that they will be 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.750
 good and such but they are already putting 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.760
 small in the sense that you already 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.140
 you have a little bit to be that I do not know 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.360
 what because or if it does not say that they are going 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.800
 subtracting are 100 days but they are going 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.380
 subtracting and maybe I want that 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.030
 I know in 43 already with what but that there 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
