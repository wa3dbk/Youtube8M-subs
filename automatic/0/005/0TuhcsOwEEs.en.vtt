00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.450
 a part of the ski are the jumps 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.920
 natural jumps jumps that 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.389
 can build or the jumps that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.890
 we can do with skis 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.710
 with skis we can jump 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.860
 and it's a way to develop our 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.470
 vertical balance our balance 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.450
 anteroposterior our balance 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.060
 lateral and our rotational equilibrium 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 let's see some ways of skiing 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.100
 by jump jumping 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 on the spatulas 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.300
 we can also ski by jump 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.260
 jumping from outside to outside skiing 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.260
 we'll see 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.680
 We can ski by jumping using the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.450
 two legs but alternatively what 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.450
 that we call the tic tac let's see it 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 tic tac tic tac tic tac tic tac other 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.990
 way to ski with jump and jump 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.340
 complete of the skis and voting on 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 the cane we are going to see it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.270
 another way that we can ski with 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.070
 jumps are with the tail jumps of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.460
 spatula or what are called jumps the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.460
 parade
