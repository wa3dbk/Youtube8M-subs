the<00:03:45.370> stamina<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.850> your<00:03:46.120> heart<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:47.049> when<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.320> do

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the stamina of your heart so when you do

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.000 
the stamina of your heart so when you do
cardio<00:03:47.950> especially<00:03:48.549> in<00:03:48.640> an<00:03:48.760> interval<00:03:49.180> um

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
cardio especially in an interval um

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.190 
cardio especially in an interval um
fashion<00:03:51.010> your<00:03:51.970> your<00:03:52.390> heart<00:03:52.660> gets<00:03:52.900> stronger

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
fashion your your heart gets stronger

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.199 
fashion your your heart gets stronger
and<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.680> actually<00:03:53.830> pump<00:03:54.250> in<00:03:54.430> more<00:03:54.640> blood

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
and it can actually pump in more blood

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.750 
and it can actually pump in more blood
so<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.870> needs<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.320> work<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.220> doesn't<00:03:57.549> need<00:03:57.610> to

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
so it needs to work it doesn't need to

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.300 
so it needs to work it doesn't need to
work<00:03:57.970> as<00:03:58.150> hard<00:03:58.330> so<00:03:58.989> people<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.560> are<00:03:59.709> have<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
work as hard so people that are have a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.789 
work as hard so people that are have a
stronger<00:04:01.299> more<00:04:01.690> cattle<00:04:02.049> cardiovascularly

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
stronger more cattle cardiovascularly

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.100 
stronger more cattle cardiovascularly
can<00:04:03.340> have<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.670> lower<00:04:04.180> resting<00:04:04.720> heart<00:04:04.870> rate

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
can have a lower resting heart rate

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.050 
can have a lower resting heart rate
because<00:04:05.380> they're<00:04:05.500> harder<00:04:05.620> stronger<00:04:06.040> I'm<00:04:06.640> this

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
because they're harder stronger I'm this

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.150 
because they're harder stronger I'm this

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
employees sicker by feet by giving them

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.890 
employees sicker by feet by giving them
this<00:05:15.370> food<00:05:15.639> and<00:05:15.849> telling<00:05:16.449> them<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:16.719> it's

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
okay and then they think that it's okay

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.939 
okay and then they think that it's okay
to<00:05:19.030> eat<00:05:19.210> like<00:05:19.509> this<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:20.139> I<00:05:20.319> mean<00:05:20.770> it's<00:05:20.889> just

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
flows better and then hopefully they're

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.290
