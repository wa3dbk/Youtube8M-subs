00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.480 

hi<00:00:05.660> there<00:00:05.900> in<00:00:06.050> this<00:00:06.290> short<00:00:06.590> video<00:00:06.800> I'm<00:00:07.220> going

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
hi there in this short video I'm going

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.369 
hi there in this short video I'm going
to<00:00:07.580> teach<00:00:07.760> you<00:00:07.819> how<00:00:08.149> to<00:00:08.210> record<00:00:08.750> the<00:00:09.080> Kinect

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
to teach you how to record the Kinect

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.080 
to teach you how to record the Kinect
data<00:00:09.559> from<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.040> Kinect<00:00:10.340> so<00:00:10.490> that<00:00:10.639> you<00:00:10.760> can<00:00:10.940> use

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
data from the Kinect so that you can use

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.570 
data from the Kinect so that you can use
it<00:00:11.240> later<00:00:11.389> with<00:00:11.660> other<00:00:11.840> applications<00:00:12.430> so<00:00:13.430> this

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
it later with other applications so this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.209 
it later with other applications so this
is<00:00:13.730> actually<00:00:14.059> fairly<00:00:14.299> simple<00:00:15.070> this<00:00:16.070> is

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
is actually fairly simple this is

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.470 
is actually fairly simple this is
assuming<00:00:16.460> that<00:00:16.640> you<00:00:16.760> have<00:00:16.910> already<00:00:17.000> plugged

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
assuming that you have already plugged

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.300 
assuming that you have already plugged
in<00:00:17.600> your<00:00:17.690> Kinect<00:00:18.080> installed<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:18.860> Kinect<00:00:19.190> for

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
in your Kinect installed the Kinect for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.220 
in your Kinect installed the Kinect for
Windows<00:00:19.369> SDK<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.540> Kinect<00:00:21.080> for<00:00:21.170> Windows

in the comments or in the description
actually<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.980> I'll<00:00:28.039> have<00:00:28.190> the<00:00:28.280> links<00:00:28.520> posted

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
actually and I'll have the links posted

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.630 
actually and I'll have the links posted
there<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:29.870> let's<00:00:29.990> get<00:00:30.140> started<00:00:30.530> step<00:00:31.280> one<00:00:31.520> is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
there so let's get started step one is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.520 
there so let's get started step one is
to<00:00:31.760> open<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.119> windows<00:00:32.599> developer<00:00:33.110> toolkit

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
to open the windows developer toolkit

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.090 
to open the windows developer toolkit
browser<00:00:34.090> now<00:00:35.090> this<00:00:35.420> browser<00:00:35.780> has<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:36.980> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
browser now this browser has all the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.560 
browser now this browser has all the
applications<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:37.730> come<00:00:37.970> with<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:38.239> Kinect

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
applications that come with the Kinect

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.690 
applications that come with the Kinect
developer<00:00:38.960> toolkit<00:00:39.460> first<00:00:40.460> thing<00:00:40.579> we're

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
developer toolkit first thing we're

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.430 
developer toolkit first thing we're
gonna<00:00:40.820> do<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.030> scroll<00:00:41.450> down<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.079> find<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
gonna do is scroll down and find the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.040 
gonna do is scroll down and find the
Kinect<00:00:45.890> Explorer<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.360> let's<00:00:47.540> click<00:00:47.750> on<00:00:47.899> the

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
Kinect Explorer so let's click on the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.250 
Kinect Explorer so let's click on the
Kinect<00:00:48.410> Explorer<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:48.860> let's<00:00:49.040> click<00:00:49.340> run<00:00:50.260> once

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
Kinect Explorer and let's click run once

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.530 
Kinect Explorer and let's click run once
you've<00:00:51.410> run<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.860> Kinect<00:00:52.100> Explorer<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:53.239> should

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
you've run the Kinect Explorer it should

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.870 
you've run the Kinect Explorer it should
detect<00:00:53.690> your<00:00:54.079> Kinect<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.680> both<00:00:55.399> your<00:00:55.610> Kinect

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
detect your Kinect and both your Kinect

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.370 
detect your Kinect and both your Kinect
explore<00:00:56.210> console<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:56.930> should<00:00:57.079> get<00:00:57.260> the

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
explore console and you should get the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.959 
explore console and you should get the
actual<00:00:57.649> Kinect<00:00:57.890> Explorer<00:00:58.280> which<00:00:58.460> shows

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
actual Kinect Explorer which shows

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.760 
actual Kinect Explorer which shows
essentially<00:00:59.630> the<00:00:59.930> image<00:01:00.200> of<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> Kinect

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
essentially the image of what the Kinect

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.970 
essentially the image of what the Kinect
is<00:01:00.920> looking<00:01:01.219> at<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:02.390> let's<00:01:02.570> minimize<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
is looking at so let's minimize the

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.340 
is looking at so let's minimize the
Kinect<00:01:04.309> Explorer<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.059> let's<00:01:05.840> minimize<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
Kinect Explorer and let's minimize the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.719 
Kinect Explorer and let's minimize the
Kinect<00:01:06.590> Explorer<00:01:06.920> console<00:01:07.340> because<00:01:07.460> those

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
Kinect Explorer console because those

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:08.590 
Kinect Explorer console because those
two<00:01:07.880> things<00:01:08.060> you're<00:01:08.180> not<00:01:08.299> going<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.539> be

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
two things you're not going to be

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.629 
two things you're not going to be
necessary<00:01:09.109> we<00:01:09.829> just<00:01:10.009> want<00:01:10.189> them<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.369> be

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:10.639 
necessary we just want them to be

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:13.239 
necessary we just want them to be
running<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.060> background<00:01:12.069> now<00:01:13.069> we're

Explorer<00:01:29.389> app<00:01:29.600> we<00:01:29.929> launched<00:01:30.319> earlier<00:01:30.709> so

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
Explorer app we launched earlier so

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.849 
Explorer app we launched earlier so
let's<00:01:31.759> click<00:01:31.939> connect<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.569> that<00:01:32.859> should

let's click connect and that should

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.279 
let's click connect and that should
connect<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.279> our<00:01:34.399> application<00:01:35.029> now<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.170> it

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
connect to our application now that it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:37.629 
connect to our application now that it
started<00:01:36.619> now<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.069> it's<00:01:37.159> connected

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
started now that it's connected

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.209 
started now that it's connected
essentially<00:01:38.119> we<00:01:38.209> can<00:01:38.329> begin<00:01:38.539> recording<00:01:39.219> now

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
essentially we can begin recording now

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.309 
essentially we can begin recording now
it's<00:01:40.369> important<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.759> note<00:01:40.969> things<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.569> here

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's important to note things here here

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.019 
it's important to note things here here
you<00:01:42.439> can<00:01:42.560> get<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.679> live<00:01:42.889> preview<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.429> say<00:01:43.700> color

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
you can get a live preview of say color

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:47.409 
you can get a live preview of say color
or<00:01:44.270> remove<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.319> color<00:01:45.499> or<00:01:46.249> a<00:01:46.310> live<00:01:47.029> preview<00:01:47.209> of

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:47.419 
or remove the color or a live preview of

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:48.760 
or remove the color or a live preview of
depth<00:01:47.659> or<00:01:47.899> remove<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.380> depth

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
depth or remove the depth

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.370

ideally<00:01:49.249> in<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.880> scenario<00:01:50.179> I<00:01:50.569> only<00:01:51.049> want<00:01:51.289> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
ideally in this scenario I only want to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.230 
ideally in this scenario I only want to
record<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.829> depth<00:01:52.069> so<00:01:52.520> let's<00:01:52.729> remove<00:01:52.969> both

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
record the depth so let's remove both

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.559 
record the depth so let's remove both
color<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:54.189> here<00:01:55.189> this<00:01:55.369> is<00:01:55.429> record<00:01:55.969> now<00:01:56.299> here

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
color and here this is record now here

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.059 
color and here this is record now here
you<00:01:56.630> can<00:01:56.779> choose<00:01:56.929> to<00:01:57.109> record<00:01:57.229> color<00:01:57.709> in<00:01:57.859> depth

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
you can choose to record color in depth

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.539 
you can choose to record color in depth
or<00:01:58.279> uncheck<00:01:59.029> color<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.799> then<00:02:00.799> only<00:02:01.069> record

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
or uncheck color and then only record

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.069 
or uncheck color and then only record
the<00:02:01.639> depth<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.299> what<00:02:02.450> I'm<00:02:02.569> going<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.899> do

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
the depth that is what I'm going to do

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.519 
the depth that is what I'm going to do
as<00:02:03.349> of<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:03.709> so<00:02:04.399> then<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.389> can<00:02:05.569> now<00:02:05.749> close<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
as of now so then you can now close the

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:10.300 
as of now so then you can now close the
color<00:02:06.739> viewer<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:09.440> fact<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.069> can<00:02:10.190> also

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
color viewer and in fact you can also

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.360 
color viewer and in fact you can also
close<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:11.060> panel<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.920> be<00:02:13.040> left<00:02:13.220> with<00:02:13.340> only

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
close this panel to be left with only

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.750 
close this panel to be left with only
these<00:02:14.000> two<00:02:14.300> screens<00:02:15.130> now<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:16.400> have<00:02:16.580> these

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
these two screens now that we have these

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.720 
these two screens now that we have these
two<00:02:16.940> screens<00:02:17.210> we<00:02:17.450> can

two screens we can

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.130 
two screens we can
we<00:02:17.940> click<00:02:18.300> record<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.650> begin<00:02:19.800> recording<00:02:20.250> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
we click record to begin recording and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.720 
we click record to begin recording and
this<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:22.379> actually<00:02:22.650> begin<00:02:23.010> recording<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this will actually begin recording the

this will actually begin recording the
connect<00:02:24.060> data<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:25.099> then<00:02:26.099> whenever<00:02:26.340> we're

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
connect data and then whenever we're
