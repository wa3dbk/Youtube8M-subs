00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.410 

the<00:00:10.530> last<00:00:10.770> step<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.370> any<00:00:11.610> hair<00:00:11.940> extension

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the last step in any hair extension

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.840 
the last step in any hair extension
installation<00:00:13.050> process<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.770> the<00:00:14.250> final<00:00:14.610> cut

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
installation process is the final cut

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.570 
installation process is the final cut
the<00:00:15.540> simplest<00:00:15.960> cut<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.189> straight

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the simplest cut is just a straight

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
the simplest cut is just a straight
across<00:00:17.820> cut<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.509> bottom<00:00:18.779> let's<00:00:19.199> take<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
across cut on the bottom let's take a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.790 
across cut on the bottom let's take a
look<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:19.769> how<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.070> done<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
look at how that's done so with the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.409 
look at how that's done so with the
extensions<00:00:23.310> installed<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.240> need<00:00:24.329> to

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
extensions installed you just need to

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.140 
extensions installed you just need to
smooth<00:00:24.659> them<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.669> see<00:00:26.939> where

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
smooth them out and you can see where

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.499 
smooth them out and you can see where
the<00:00:27.929> layers<00:00:28.199> start<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.919> separate<00:00:29.339> so<00:00:30.239> with

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
the layers start to separate so with

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.840 
the layers start to separate so with
this<00:00:30.689> style<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.619> definitely<00:00:32.189> need<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.520> remove

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this style we definitely need to remove

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.080 
this style we definitely need to remove
this<00:00:33.750> lower<00:00:34.109> bit<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.680> order<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.129> justify<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this lower bit in order to justify that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.189 
this lower bit in order to justify that
shape<00:00:36.449> so<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.410> we're<00:00:37.500> gonna<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:39.199> smooth

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
shape so what we're gonna do smooth

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.340 
shape so what we're gonna do smooth
everything<00:00:40.469> down<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> take<00:00:43.199> your<00:00:43.230> razor<00:00:43.559> tool

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
everything down and take your razor tool

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.810 
everything down and take your razor tool
and<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.859> simply<00:00:47.190> notch<00:00:47.429> that<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:49.820> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and just simply notch that out the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.599 
and just simply notch that out the
reason<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> razor<00:00:51.870> tool<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
reason you want to use a razor tool is

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.689 
reason you want to use a razor tool is
that<00:00:53.609> you<00:00:53.760> don't<00:00:53.969> want<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:55.429> straight<00:00:56.429> straight

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that you don't want a straight straight

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.439 
that you don't want a straight straight
line<00:00:56.960> they<00:00:57.960> need<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.350> feathered<00:00:59.449> slightly

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
line they need to be feathered slightly

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.619 
line they need to be feathered slightly
on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.660> ends<00:01:01.429> because<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.940> extensions<00:01:03.480> are

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
on the ends because the extensions are

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.010 
on the ends because the extensions are
installed<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.290> rows<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.810> want

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
installed in rows and you don't want

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:28.430 
installed in rows and you don't want
that<00:01:07.860> line<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.579> too<00:01:08.759> harsh

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.660 

you

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.999 

once<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.479> have<00:01:38.509> your<00:01:38.780> basic<00:01:38.990> shape<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:39.680> with

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
once you have your basic shape in with

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.649 
once you have your basic shape in with
your<00:01:40.220> razor<00:01:40.400> you're<00:01:41.210> going<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.479> take<00:01:41.630> your

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
shears and you're going to come back

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.929 
shears and you're going to come back
through<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.450> just<00:01:44.540> point<00:01:45.409> cut<00:01:45.939> any

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
through and just point cut any

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.550 

that<00:01:59.670> gives<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.940> a<00:01:59.970> nice<00:02:00.210> soft<00:02:00.960> polished<00:02:01.800> line

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 

okay<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.700> we've<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.000> bottom

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
okay now that we've got that bottom

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
okay now that we've got that bottom
shapen<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> same<00:02:11.280> thing

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
shapen just going to do the same thing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.140 
shapen just going to do the same thing
just<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.270> clean<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> edges<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.819> reason

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
just to clean up the edges the reason

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
just to clean up the edges the reason
that<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> line<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> bottom<00:02:18.959> needs<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that the line on the bottom needs to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.949 
that the line on the bottom needs to
stay<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.370> soft<00:02:20.730> as<00:02:20.940> possible<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.599> because<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
stay as soft as possible is because of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.140 
stay as soft as possible is because of
scalp<00:02:22.440> movement<00:02:22.830> at<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> top<00:02:23.250> when

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
scalp movement at the top when

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.259 
scalp movement at the top when
extensions<00:02:24.750> are<00:02:24.870> stretched<00:02:25.640> forward<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
extensions are stretched forward the

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.360 
extensions are stretched forward the
lines<00:02:27.510> tend<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> separate<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.530> way<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.010> when

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
lines tend to separate one way and when

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.920 
lines tend to separate one way and when
they're<00:02:29.519> stretched<00:02:29.819> backwards<00:02:30.330> they<00:02:30.630> tend<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
they're stretched backwards they tend to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
they're stretched backwards they tend to
separate<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.530> other<00:02:31.709> way<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.209> need<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
separate the other way so you need to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.180 
separate the other way so you need to
make<00:02:33.569> sure<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.140> line<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.739> nice<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
make sure that that line is nice and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.550 
make sure that that line is nice and
soft<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.480> always<00:02:36.660> looks<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
soft so that it always looks like a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710 
soft so that it always looks like a
straight<00:02:37.860> line<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.819> last<00:02:39.090> step<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.600> your

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
straight line the last step in your

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.660 
straight line the last step in your
final<00:02:39.989> cut<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.890> connect<00:02:41.250> your<00:02:41.370> front

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
final cut is to connect your front

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.240 
final cut is to connect your front
layers<00:02:41.880> with<00:02:42.299> your<00:02:42.450> bottom<00:02:42.810> layers<00:02:43.100> I'm<00:02:44.100> going

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
layers with your bottom layers I'm going

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.280 
layers with your bottom layers I'm going
to<00:02:44.310> take<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.640> front<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.720> we're<00:02:45.959> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.110> use

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to take the front and we're going to use

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.630 
to take the front and we're going to use
a<00:02:46.560> slide<00:02:46.950> cut<00:02:47.220> motion<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.500> connect<00:02:49.890> this

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
a slide cut motion to just connect this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.780 
a slide cut motion to just connect this
