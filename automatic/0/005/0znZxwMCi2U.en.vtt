 but it can also be very helpful for those behind the 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.850

 in order to have a chat as we met in a bar 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.980
 a cup of coffee with a good glass of wine today 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.390
 without time being the master of our time 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.250
 I know many people who constantly complain about perkins live 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.560
 below the standard level as p 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.630
 there are many people who would like to have a higher quality of life than 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.850
 the current one 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.430
 mass how they behave like what they do 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940
 nothing speaks at all 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.430
 there are only a few people who start to do chat 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.069
 something to you to really reach 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.490
 the goals you set yourself 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 many people believe that change is a long and arduous journey I have 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.169
 made of sacrifices by force of will 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.489
 but is not so 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 change can take place in the Enlightenment 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:23.429
 have you ever been an old coach athlete at a time of the season 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:27.299
 sporting where everything was going but everything was right 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.999
 whatever myths do succeeded 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.809
 luca toni when he became top scorer in the Serie A championship 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:39.959
 with the Florentine jersey at the 2005 2006 contract season a goal made 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.169
 4 in the Italian cup winning the golden shoe 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.519
 he said in an interview that something like this has never happened to him 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.799
 that just touched the cream with any part of the body though 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.089
 open mistakes or valgus faces 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.399
 the following year iwata interview luca toni said that he also had 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.239
 experience is the kind place 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.099
 and that is that unfortunately there are days when everything is rather 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.659
 days of time 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.849
 where any initiative 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.129
 if one takes a robe 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.019
 any attempt that one ends up with nothing 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.839
 that you are already 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:24.300
 during the game you are spitting out that you can shoot important even a thousand times 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.679
 but you will never go 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.410
 where the difference lies 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.410
 yet it was the same person 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.519
 he had within himself the possibility of always having the same resources as 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.479
 I had had it the year before 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.939
 even from the most hopeful 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:43.989

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.739

 days when they do everything beautifully 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:01.039
 and then they have others I want to find either, do the most beautiful things of 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.079
 more beautiful things and mint the big difference 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.929
 but sought for the logical xico condition 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.389

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.479

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.580
 we enter and exit from states of mind 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 positivity and negativity 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.509
 never been a situation where a person maybe your wife a lot 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.520
 higher 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.240
 he replied in a bad way without you having done anything so serious 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.870
 believe that person communicates 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.309
 oh ask 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.029
 to everyone always that way 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.240
 yes it is true there are also 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.870
 of the people they have

 an ugly temper

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.050
 from birth 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.319
 but it is more likely than that until now 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.639
 that person who answered you badly hypothetically had the big one 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.570
 bad day but from those who took a fine 5 minutes sooner or later squabble 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.059
 with someone around you do 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.430
 basically it cannot be said that a bad person 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.759
 simply 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.779
 in the moment in which it was replied in a bad way perhaps a state is found 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.129
 mood 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.340
 you could automatically change your behavior if only you were able 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.319
 to change the cost of 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.409
 Understanding moods is the key to understanding this change
