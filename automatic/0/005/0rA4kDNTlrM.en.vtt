sort<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.459> tapering<00:03:39.850> edge<00:03:40.060> right<00:03:40.270> now<00:03:40.480> you

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
sort of a tapering edge right now you

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.150 
sort of a tapering edge right now you
can<00:03:40.780> actually<00:03:40.900> put<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.380> in<00:03:41.590> whichever<00:03:42.010> way

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
can actually put this in whichever way

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.340 
can actually put this in whichever way
you'd<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:43.570> they've<00:03:43.750> done<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.990> couple<00:03:44.200> of

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
you'd like so they've done a couple of

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.800 
you'd like so they've done a couple of
new<00:03:44.530> things<00:03:44.760> probably<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.209> coolest<00:03:46.510> that

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
new things probably the coolest that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.020 
new things probably the coolest that
I've<00:03:46.930> seen<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.260> far

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
I've seen so far

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.170 
I've seen so far
and<00:03:49.510> right<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:49.960> if<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.260> hover<00:03:50.880> over<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.090> click

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
and right so if you hover over and click

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.480 
and right so if you hover over and click
once<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:53.290> get<00:03:53.440> your<00:03:53.560> menu<00:03:53.920> up<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.220> if<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.400> do

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
once you get your menu up and if you do

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.720 
once you get your menu up and if you do
into<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:54.820> pen<00:03:55.150> window<00:03:55.420> option<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.520> then

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
into this pen window option you can then

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:06.390 
into this pen window option you can then
that's<00:03:58.570> obstruction<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.560> then<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:06.250> see

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
that's obstruction and then you see

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.580 
that's obstruction and then you see
quadruple<00:04:06.940> options<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.540> whatever<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.440> want

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
quadruple options to whatever you want

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.020 
quadruple options to whatever you want
to<00:04:08.650> go<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.220> bottle<00:04:09.490> box<00:04:09.610> like<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.910> teeth

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
to go and that bottle box like the teeth

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.890 
to go and that bottle box like the teeth
of<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.209> calculator<00:04:10.780> loads<00:04:11.590> calculator<00:04:12.900> you

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
of the calculator loads calculator you

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.050 
of the calculator loads calculator you
can<00:04:13.990> do<00:04:14.110> this<00:04:14.290> little<00:04:15.100> time<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.610> let's<00:04:15.880> say

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
can do this little time so let's say

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:25.050 
can do this little time so let's say
I've<00:04:16.690> got<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.079> calculator<00:04:17.470> of<00:04:23.669> another<00:04:24.669> cops

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
I've got the calculator of another cops

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.560 
I've got the calculator of another cops
with<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:27.370> now<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:27.700> can<00:04:27.910> actually<00:04:28.000> have<00:04:28.330> as

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
with so now you can actually have as

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.210 
with so now you can actually have as
another<00:04:28.840> box<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.260> top<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.500> another<00:04:29.740> box<00:04:30.040> you

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
another box on top of another box you

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.290 
another box on top of another box you
can<00:04:30.340> see<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:30.640> keep<00:04:30.910> going<00:04:31.210> with

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
can see that you just keep going with

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.500 
can see that you just keep going with
this<00:04:31.390> you<00:04:31.930> can<00:04:31.990> actually<00:04:32.320> close<00:04:32.770> them<00:04:36.510> so

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
this you can actually close them so

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
this you can actually close them so
they've<00:04:37.660> done<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.840> whole<00:04:37.990> bunch<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.290> stuff

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
yet I do believe there are only 32 gig

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.480 
yet I do believe there are only 32 gig
64<00:05:03.360> gig<00:05:03.629> versions<00:05:04.169> of<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.379> device<00:05:04.650> meaning

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
64 gig versions of the device meaning

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.790 
64 gig versions of the device meaning
all<00:05:05.939> of<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> new<00:05:06.330> add-on<00:05:06.659> stuff<00:05:07.020> was<00:05:07.319> too<00:05:07.620> much
