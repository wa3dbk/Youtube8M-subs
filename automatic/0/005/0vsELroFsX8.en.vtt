 guatafan gamer in our second 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:11.309
 tutorial and in the case of today we bring you 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:14.179
 how to download and install 1.0 up to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.179
 the 1.8 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 well the first thing we want is 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:27.080
 download the file that I told you in the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.080
 mediafire page that is five minutes 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.630
 well this will give you right click 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.630
 extract here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 It is no longer what it was 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.110
 this installer file we will give you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.110
 Double click 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.620
 now that there is not to sleep 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.420
 and if it will open a window that is for 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.210
 install in minecraft 1.8 we give you that 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.039
 yes and this is the link the process before 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.040
 only that this one is already a launcher of 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.130
 greater investment 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.020
 let's say it's the most updated to the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.680
 previous video that was of the proposal and 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.680
 7.2 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.540
 cancel because I already have a good one 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.630
 once installed they will be left 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.410
 on the desk which is very serious 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 this goes a lot to the prize but it does not 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.380
 we will double click and if they force us to 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.390
 kraft the launcher which is the interim 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.409
 which it is one of my favorite or most 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.859
 it's worth once here 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.880
 we have here in relay the 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:45.009
 default but felix is ​​from 1.0 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.009
 until 1,800 we give the 1.8 and you 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.819
 We gave good this took a little bit because 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:56.079
 it's the first time we opened 1.8 so 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:58.900
 that from here has generated that 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.260
 improve more 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.780
 how many grams because this the first of 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.200
 1.8 because I think yesterday yesterday I think that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.330
 it came out and it came to lunch and I think 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.950
 you do not have it so they see is what 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.950
 I'm uploading to the channel 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.550
 we wait for them to come up 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.620
 Hairline up here so that seconds 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.920
 personal to the need to press the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.920
 video 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.360
 This has already started 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:45.239
 it does not exist here 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:45.239
 and good these past 18 days 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.209
 22.8 better as official 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.230
 we will be without doubt bayern we will liberate 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.349
 remains 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.349
 and creative world 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.060
 let's create some world 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.819
 I put you with the fields you are going to see 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.360
 a little weird a little square 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.910
 but 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.520
 from the Mount 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.910
 they do not matter and I also think we can 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.840
 run is that you can record with the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.860
 cant asia 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.910
 Well, there was no work 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.910
 we wait for what is said in the world 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.560
 padilla 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.590
 what happens if I have a lake ribery 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.060
 and what 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.060
 The good thing is that this is who 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:03.040
 it's good that in the savannah we give 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.099
 food 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.099
 and that here is disco music 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.879
 and we will do the inventory 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.879
 supposedly there was no way out 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 marin 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:32.750
 already would be what would be the meat of 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:35.770
 rabbit and sheep meat that something else 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.770
 is that it was from both 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.840
 these prism crystals what is the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.230
 meat 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.150
 the doors that is that now every 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.400
 door comes with the color that 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.010
 corresponds to the wood then if it is 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.430
 jungle wise wood or would go out to 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.430

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.460
