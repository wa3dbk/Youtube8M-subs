00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.549
 at some point they fell to the ground in 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.420
 fetal position and a sea of ​​tears 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.530

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.530
 begins to open and close 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.159
 quickly as if you were searching 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.780
 desperately to say something 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:09.410
 anything and them too terrified 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.690

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.959
 looking for me first under the bed then 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.380

 I knew you would look in those places 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:30.169
 so after you finish your surprise 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:34.040

 do to stop but see still found 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.440
 a surprise though is I could guess that 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.459
 I'm still thinking about seeing you 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.829
 while scanning the closet villas I knew that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.150

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.130

 what would have been inside what 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.740
 you would have found this indecision not 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.670
 could last forever 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.530
 we both knew it slowly 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.400
 approach the wardrobe and put one down 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:18.220
 hand on the knob you took a deep 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:26.320
 breath and suddenly open up style 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:29.380

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.160
 photos of you at the computer or scattered i 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.970
 hair that I had collected all along 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.950
 the pages as an ornament together had 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.020
 couples on which I have pasted ours 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.940

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.700
 I left your picture with that boy 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.940
 but with a slight scraped modification v 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.360
 to the vote of that asshole the eye from 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.540

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.590
 half an hour later you get up 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:50.770

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 surprise because these people are brought 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:05.199
 in our house they will never find me 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:07.090
 but if they did they would ruin everything 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.910

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:15.820
