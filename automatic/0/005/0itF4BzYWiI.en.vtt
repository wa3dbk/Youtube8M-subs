 There is already a lot of information that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.920
 finally if protein can help 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.140
 make these diseases progressive 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.150

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.190

 house put habanero ahead salt and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.350
 pepper and a little coriander for 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.870
 give it that flavor and that very touch 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.850
 Mexican and very from our land and as 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.550
 you can see here we have a dish 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.810
 which is low in calories and very simple 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.390
 to do what we're going to put here in a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 Pour a little bit of oil because 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.650
 it's fat every spoon of fat contains 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.600
 90 calories so we're going to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.700
 save us a little bit of calories 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.569
 in our diet and we are going to put to brown 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.249
 our onions 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.900
 well let's add this way the 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.480
 mushrooms in skillet estelí 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.890
 hot for mushrooms 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.930
 fill 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.760
 the onion was left and we are all going to 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.150
 now let the mushrooms take 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.800
 Formitas and meanwhile we are going to put 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.800
 to work with nicole 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.080
 work good days or good ones 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.300
 then in our blender we are going to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.000
 add water 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.900
 so that he does not suffer or coat we are going to 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.230
 put the green tomatoes 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.230
 and we are going to add the green chilito 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.030
 we are going to put our hermitages a 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.120
 little cilantro 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.830
 that they can also put on if they want 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.959
 two shepherd leaves, nothing more 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.110
 to give it flavor and we're going to put 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.960
 a little salt to our blender 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.720
 and let's go 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.450
 and 40 match 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.270
 already with the mushroom here just because if 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.310
 Do not start to let go of your ulna 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.940
 add salsita de errores come 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.940
 it comes out and 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.709
 it smells good huh 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.530
 and it smells good and here the ideal is to leave 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.930
 that the juice is reduced I recommend them 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.239
 that they put the sauce to cover to cover 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.370
 the mushrooms nothing more until there for 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.470
 let the mushroom release its juice and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.840
 also absorb a little of the sauce that 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.790
 let's put it right now and let it boil 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.269
 boil that you take your time do not plug it 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.760
 so that it reduces the juice and with this 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.470
 what dry we do not go to a cut do not go 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.190
 that we are going to return with meats played at 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.190
 Jalisco style 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.600
 Y
