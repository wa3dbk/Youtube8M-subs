00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:06.280
 his ladies and gentlemen I call on the additional points 10 to 12 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.930
 To advise the applications of the faction the left with the title no tanks 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.939
 selling saudi arabia 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.910
 as well as the fraction of the SPD with the title no armaments in 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.230
 voltage areas 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.320
 for compliance with a restrictive arms export policy 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.919
 and the Alliance 90 Alliance entitled the Greens 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 none accept for the supply of weapons of war to Saudi Arabia 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.870
 over 3 all three applications become the later by name 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.120
 in an intergroup agree that for the tender half an hour 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 intended 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.670
 just not a contradiction 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.120
 Then that's how it is 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.350
 decided 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.200
 i open up the pronunciation of the parts they will be for 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 Fraction the left the word 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.670
 Colleagues Dear Colleagues IT wants to welcome you once again 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.940
 Take a seat so that it can only be placed 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.400
 Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.320
 why did we make this request here today &amp; now 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.580
 Twelve of us have an application from us to monitor our plus us exports 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.590
 ban entire area also to Saudi Arabia 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.860
 but these applications will not be decided until the fall 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.660
 now we all belong 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.960
 which is supposedly already decided or will be decided shortly 200 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.720
 tank 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.510
 to deliver to Saudi Arabia I consider this a "unique scandal" 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.390
 the procedure carries here set a clear stop sign 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.869
 now Parliament is needed now it has to act too 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.020
 Incidentally, tank delivery also makes the entire German foreign policy the one 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.020
 security and war policy completely implausible I want in the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.150
 justify 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.200
 First of all, this government has just declared that they are the Arab and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.210
 North African spring supported in every way 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.790
 Therefore, it is even justified to have guards delivered to the markets 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.350
 so that you could better bomb Libya and Tripoli because of this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.810
 at least supposedly helping the insurgents and protesters 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.779
 and if they decide at the same time 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.819
 also to deliver weapons to a country that are invading neighboring countries 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.909
 to unite the democracy and freedom movement they make themselves 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.909
 «Completely implausible» 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.399
 the 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.829
 Jörg Haider implausible if they once weapons on the grounds 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.489
 It should serve the freedom fighters and 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.659
 On the other hand, arms to a country prefer the freedom movement in the country 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.979
 Join neighboring country 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.219
 how do they explain this to their children and grandchildren? 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.109
 When you deliver weapons, you never travel when they are used 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.109
 Imagine that once there is no democracy and 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.439
 Freedom movement in Saudi Arabia 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.369
 and also bombarded the partners German tanks 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.940
 i ask her again what is wrong she thanks her children 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.599
 and her grandchildren 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.479
 here you can 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.009
 Brett before the goal founded the war in Afghanistan with the fight against 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.189
 terror 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.459
 the hubris and most dangerous terrorist organization is a plaintiff 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:20.639
 alternative is exclusively from the richer families of Saudi Arabia 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.969
 paid 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.969
 here, too, politics becomes completely untrustworthy 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.839
 she sent soldiers to Afghanistan 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.609
 They cause there lived even if it was in their own ranks 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.019
 and after their explanation 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.419
 the whole life came against al Qaeda and at the same time they supply 200 tanks 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.589
 a land is being paid off the talker again 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:47.589
 i appeal to you think that the one kids and grandchildren 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:55.299
 Much more important than winning they are specifically for use against 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.919
 Insurgents and demonstrators are suitable because they have plow blades 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.009
 Water cannons tear gas was the culprit 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.369
 krauss-maffei Wegmann the whole as follows about the two 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:11.559
 Coalition parties donated 55,000 euros in 2009, which was very worthwhile 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.889
 two years later gets a billionaire order 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.069
 I say in Saudi Arabia 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.949
 Tip more money for military than any other country in the region 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.719
 even more than Iran this is Iraq and Egypt together only in the year 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.729
 2010 $ 43 billion 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.770
 what is saudi arabia negated 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.340
 in saudi arabia, there is not even a gender equality approach 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.360
 and men 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.840
 Brown is prohibited from driving by car 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 they are subject to legal male guardianship until marriage in 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.990
 usually the father 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.479
 then the husband 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.340
 without a formal permission that is a rule of the husband allowed a woman 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.490
 do not even travel abroad 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.199
 I think it's the first time in my history 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.009
 that I am in the Bundestag for a certain time and quote what I do today 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.189
 I quote the picture newspaper 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.219
 and that's what she said in yesterday's issue 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.850
 Saudi Arabia is one of the hottest dictatorships in the world, writes the picture 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.409
 and then the world keeps writing 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.909
 literally becomes political opposition to the royal ruling family 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:19.900
 repressed 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.770
 Demonstrations are imprisonment 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.620
 the country enforces the death penalty even in homosexuality, I ask you 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.969
 even in homosexuality the death penalty 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.240
 by decapitation with sword 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.930
 the Saudi dry rim thereby the democracy movement in the neighboring state 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.250
 Bahrain beat down bloody quote end all the picture newspaper if they 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.250
 I already believe the picture newspaper while at least there is room 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.990
 the number of executions 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.979
 March 2009 was 1000 912 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.020
 how do you want to explain to their children and children explain to such a country 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.400
 To offer tanks 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.689
 I'll come to the end 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:02.889
 Right light moved 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.630
 UNWRA approval error I also do not talk about the armaments 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.219
 not lines contrary to the assumption of the SPD are unfortunately not restrictive 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:12.819
 but I say only one thing 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.929
 if Germany in its foreign policy in its human rights policy 

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:20.210
 Democracy politics does not want everyone to lose credibility 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.790
 if they look after their children and their grandchildren for certain moral 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.110
 Standards ever want to explain the world then he knows that we export today 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.919
 of 200 tanks a Saudi Arabia floor
