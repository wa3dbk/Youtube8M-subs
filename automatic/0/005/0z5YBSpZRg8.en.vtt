00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
inch staple back then we had paper

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.120

Jason sitting next to a roll of paper
back<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:08.209> anyhow<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.510> paper<00:03:09.959> back<00:03:10.350> we

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
back now anyhow that paper back we

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.949 
back now anyhow that paper back we
didn't<00:03:11.010> need<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.160> shear<00:03:11.520> wall<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.030> our<00:03:12.330> staples

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
didn't need a shear wall so our staples

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.570 
didn't need a shear wall so our staples
were<00:03:13.080> only<00:03:13.230> 7/8<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.190> an<00:03:14.280> inch
