00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.190
 today we are going to make min commitments for that we are going to need new us in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.510
 time of the recipe 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.369
 that we have to pay the agents 12 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.339
 then we are going to sign an egg video 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.509
 we are going to give him to mix the games with sugar first 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.779
 in the blender 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:17.779
 after 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.969
 let's shout chocolate flour and butter 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.909
 the first as we say is to mix the sugar with the games in the blender 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.939
 until I felt this foam did not want when we arrived 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.449
 meanwhile we are going to microwave the chocolate with the 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 Butter 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.060
 Well let's go 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
 we start therefore for you 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 this mixture 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.480
 sincelejo 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 characteristically 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.340
 with this defeat the background match 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.730
 without these measures of saving that we already cost overheated 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.090
 we are going to 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 put in the microwave 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 the polar bear 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.980
 I have the mind 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.580
 have not stopped beating we see that we have a mass 8 these facts well 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 It is great for transfers 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.090
 now let's mix right here 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 of low speed that in a short time 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.490
 we are going bad 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 - well also 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.470
 for those who come 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.090
 my hands are fine 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.950
 a minute before mentioning some 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.250
 we already have one side 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.190
 butter with dissolved chocolate 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.730
 or it will cool a bit so it does not help to lower the dough 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.130
 obstacles warmed half do not rush us until last minute this 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.910
 season and it will not harm us 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.030
 On the other hand we have our dough which has already incorporated the flour 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.980
 that we have to be with Beijing less than what it should be but by having 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.760
 sure we're going to mix a little more 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.820
 will weigh coquimbanos mixing with a normal spoon here children for 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.599
 that these bubbles remain 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.719
 let's go until it's all together 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:16.509
 we can throw if we want a few drops of chocolate and civilians so that we do not 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.309
 remain as more physical happens when proposing another health 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.819
 it's also time 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.689
 in fact some websites and we want us to see them and 9 sweden without 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.679
 been for the mun2 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.009
 once it's all mixed with two packs and we're all going 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.839
 incorporating 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.389
 some molds that we have in isolated 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.349
 you do not have to put a lot because for me you do not have to suffer especially 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.999
 critical 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.449
 is the court that declares 2 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:45.509
 what do we do 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.509
 this center is more centered 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.390
 the pope prayed that the bone mass 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.290
 the August hope the third part of the electorate to rise equally 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.400
 now it rises and rises little because the answer of the doubt but the little that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.229
 suffer 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.019
 in room 1 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.090
 we wait about 30 to 35 minutes we are checking 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.929
 to see if this one but about 30 to 35 minutes should also be so 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.499
 do not wait a little longer once that jail for me what we're going to 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.409
 do is use our pierced 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.009
 kiss like this rake for 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.259
 Athens objects because we do it now 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.259
 the good thing about a single one is the bark above 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.809
 if we let it cool and without making holes then we will not be able to cut 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.189
 because it's very hard and it's going to crack 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.959
 if we take advantage and we are now we operate 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.529
 what we do new 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.529
 is to have nobody in the facts or but without cracking 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.089
 we do it and towards the other as we want to cut them 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.349
 say those little ones 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.089
 If we beni-enzar the perforator we studied using lookout followed 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.829
 we can see the other defendant nor 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.290
 stays in the corners 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.709
 As you will remember, there are no monitos 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.709
 also this morning stations is perfect 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.529
 this is the result 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.209
 he has to be left 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.229
 braun and 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.229
 like a little tense in the middle 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.900
 it's about that the court is the west 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.709
 center 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.120
 little less done 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.190
 once the oven is done we go because the subsidiary 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.640
 there are people who say that to stop doing movies 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.029
 It's great because above 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.830
 with mold and all day a wet cloth 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.060
 so that it does not continue to be produced inside
