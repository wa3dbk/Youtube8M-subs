00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
is there and I think it's getting

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.719 
is there and I think it's getting
carried<00:01:57.689> away<00:01:57.869> when<00:01:58.170> media<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> come<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.549> in

carried away when media is come out in
such<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> strong<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.680> little

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
such a strong we have to be little

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:02.600 
such a strong we have to be little
careful

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
careful

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.620

I<00:02:02.790> mean<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:04.049> saying<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.630> play

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

the<00:02:06.780> game<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.469> tough<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.190> possible

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the game as tough as possible

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
the game as tough as possible
but<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.959> cricketer<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
but I think we cricketer have a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.180 
but I think we cricketer have a
responsibility<00:02:11.550> not

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
responsibility not

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.430

take the game backward rather than we

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.500 
take the game backward rather than we

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
bad words what we use on on uncommon

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.800 
bad words what we use on on uncommon
commonly<00:03:01.640> one<00:03:01.880> can<00:03:02.120> say<00:03:02.300> on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.540> cricket

commonly one can say on the cricket

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.900 
commonly one can say on the cricket
field<00:03:02.840> sometime<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.400> I'm<00:03:04.520> sure<00:03:04.550> it

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
field sometime right and I'm sure it

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.690 
field sometime right and I'm sure it
came<00:03:05.150> from<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> Indian<00:03:05.810> land<00:03:06.020> as<00:03:06.200> well<00:03:06.350> I

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
came from the Indian land as well I

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.000 
came from the Indian land as well I
think<00:03:07.700> if<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.630> put<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:09.050> I'm<00:03:09.200> not<00:03:09.350> trying<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.770> take

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
think if I put it I'm not trying to take

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.850 
think if I put it I'm not trying to take
Indian<00:03:10.460> side<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.120> think<00:03:11.270> Indian<00:03:12.230> side<00:03:12.530> was

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
Indian side but I think Indian side was

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.130 
Indian side but I think Indian side was
over<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> period<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.760> time<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.330> 3040<00:03:14.960> years

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
over the period of time in 3040 years

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.910 
over the period of time in 3040 years
the<00:03:15.470> most<00:03:15.710> sober<00:03:16.640> team<00:03:16.880> not<00:03:17.810> recently<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.709> think

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
the most sober team not recently I think

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.880 
the most sober team not recently I think
recently<00:03:19.760> they<00:03:20.300> they're<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.050> Top<00:03:21.290> Gear<00:03:21.650> they

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
recently they they're in a Top Gear they

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.400 
recently they they're in a Top Gear they
don't<00:03:22.150> really<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.450> young<00:03:23.630> boys<00:03:23.930> come<00:03:24.290> out

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
don't really the young boys come out

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.250 
don't really the young boys come out
much<00:03:24.770> more<00:03:25.010> aggressive<00:03:25.520> than<00:03:25.959> during<00:03:26.959> our

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
much more aggressive than during our

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.460 
much more aggressive than during our
period<00:03:27.590> our<00:03:27.920> period<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.550> don't<00:03:29.060> think<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:29.630> we

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
period our period I don't think so we

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.630 
period our period I don't think so we
had<00:03:31.390> aggression<00:03:32.390> as<00:03:32.570> much<00:03:32.959> as<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.830> young<00:03:34.430> boys

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640
