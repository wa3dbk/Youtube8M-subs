00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
rank reset and didn't know what's going

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.860 
rank reset and didn't know what's going
on<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.550> would<00:01:11.670> definitely<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.180> very<00:01:12.210> scared

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
on I would definitely be very scared

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.270 
on I would definitely be very scared
because<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:14.010> working

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
because obviously all that time working

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.860 
because obviously all that time working
on<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.580> rank<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> definitely<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> waste

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
on that rank would be definitely a waste

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.480 
on that rank would be definitely a waste
now<00:01:16.410> this<00:01:16.560> could<00:01:16.710> happen<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.070> any<00:01:17.250> single

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

there were some problems with the

there were some problems with the
interaction<00:02:43.010> menu<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.400> stuff<00:02:43.549> like<00:02:43.700> that

perhaps<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.780> was<00:02:44.840> another<00:02:45.200> problem<00:02:45.530> or<00:02:46.010> it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
perhaps this was another problem or it

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.130 
perhaps this was another problem or it
may<00:02:46.400> be<00:02:46.610> caused<00:02:46.910> by<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.239> aftermath<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.989> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
may be caused by the aftermath of the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.960 
may be caused by the aftermath of the
DDoS<00:02:48.440> attacks<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.129> have<00:02:49.220> no<00:02:49.519> idea

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
DDoS attacks I have no idea

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.400 
DDoS attacks I have no idea
so<00:02:50.329> Rockstar<00:02:50.690> Games<00:02:50.810> are<00:02:51.019> actually<00:02:51.230> aware

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
so Rockstar Games are actually aware

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.259 
so Rockstar Games are actually aware
that<00:02:51.590> these<00:02:51.769> type<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.069> problems<00:02:52.459> do<00:02:52.640> happen<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
that these type of problems do happen so

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.759 
that these type of problems do happen so
