00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.670
 Speak beauty people here, the speaker is 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.299
 rodrigo with another video technology to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.010
 you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.099
 today I'm here in a middle environment 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.799
 You are only seeing the dark screen 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.940
 of the tablet is for anyone but a tablet is 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.250
 a galaxy tab pro s mt-320 i have 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
 some videos there on another channel put 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.590
 the link for you to see if you want 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 really like discovering the channel 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.000
 ops the channel there of one of a network without 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.960
 wireless network to choose the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 best channel 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 Let's start entering this 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 subject I put here in the corner 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.570
 I hope the application is walking 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 for you to see cool in an application 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 called will say I'll put the link 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.449
 for you do the download down there 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.360
 installation logic you open you 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.739
 will see this little face here if you have 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.739
 with tablet or mobile phone will change 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 position but basically it will be this 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.049
 application interface it has 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 various utilities for the wireless network 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.970
 including you can see channel or be 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.479
 signal strength is the mark of the router 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.790
 and has several possible information 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:20.360
 Click the button in the left corner 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.119
 here it has some ripple here 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.860
 He'll show me the networks. 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.590
 shows with one with these lines so 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.930
 horizontal the power and also the name 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.259
 the economy of the network and a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 colors to aid visualization even by 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.829
 example in blue 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 the network soon do not know exactly what 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.250
 cure is this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 fox trot that has a red network 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.960
 called shrek is that it has a better signal 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.990
 all these networks are mine here me 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.140
 I have neighbors network is blue 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 thalita is home among several other networks 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.909
 so here I know cases this a channel 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.550
 Only a pity that the center here is 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.970
 wave of sound through the ripple was a 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.890
 channel 1 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.150
 You can see that it swayed 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.350
 equator sign that also treats 9187 plus 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.340
 or less 80 and 57 90 horrible cassol and 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.310
 have the networks 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.960
 it is also good that they are in channel 6 the network 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.220
 fox trot on channel 8 on channel 9 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.770
 the rich blog had not spoken in the channel 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.320
 21 as those networks here that are more 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.410
 far away are very weak and do not 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.500
 problem is an overlap of 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.220
 because it is only so weak that at least 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.170
 channel 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.120
 it has an overlap only that as the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.209
 signal arrives weak it does not arrive 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.950
 really cover the remaining channel 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.670
 interference by 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.400
 far away then counting my 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.770
 networks that ignore the law that the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.720
 romi is appearing from time to time I 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.510
 I'm lucky to have it in the middle 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.400
 environment at this location is best not 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.760
 has no channel overlay 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.370
 then it is the network with less interference 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.600
 already fox trot and the other new a8 has a lot 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
 overlap 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:30.430
 So it's very close so here it goes. 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.620
 turn an interference in the network will 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.010
 slowing down can lead to loss of 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.840
 packet may be generating drops in the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.610
 for example if you had four 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.269
 networks on the same channel, one on the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.600
 other 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.150
 sure and act at various drops of 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.130
 signal 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.709
 then it would be really complicated then 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.970
 Let's have problem for 12 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:02.620
 I could put the fox trot network here 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.940
 6 17 in the channel 11 for example 13 and 12 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.850
 14 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.450
 you can use but as I said how 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.440
 I explained in the video about wires 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.960
 interference channels etc. 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.840
 You can see the link 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.620
 down here is not ideal either 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.210
 use channels 12 13 and 14 at least 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.910
 in Brazil to generate a greater 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.340
 equipment compatibility then 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.080
 the states japan equipment 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.130
 attached anywhere 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.900
 channel 11 is sure to work 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.200
 have a compatibility so I recommend 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.390
 use channels 1 to 11 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.540
 so to keep to a minimum of 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:49.110
 Interference can place 16 11 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.650
 then there would be reducing rather is whether 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.930
 Do you want to change the channel of your 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.490
 your router if you have the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.030
 tpi that already has a video here on the channel 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.200
 showing how to change is the channel I give 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.670
 they 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.800
 if you have any other brand of 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.230
 router just ask me who is a good 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.900
 way to try a brand new router 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.790
 that you have to show how to do 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.830
 change of channel and boat 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.590
 developer to do other things 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.110
 so here's the wifi application avaÃ­ 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.040
 it has several other functions but there it is 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.590
 has a silver 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.810
 other videos he has included a 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.970
 to find the best channel for you 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.970
 to install a router as well 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.260
 showing national level if you are going 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.350
 walking is important there very interesting 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.210
 for you to do a survey site walking 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.400
 at least on the spot and end with this 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.470
 function that will show which signal 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.500
 exactly where you stand 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.630
 but have ready other heifer videos 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.180
 so if you like the video clip no 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.100
 I liked it and click on the young one there share 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.220
 subscribe to the channel to receive more 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.300
 news make comments with questions 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.680
 suggestions 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.960
 I have to answer the staff always 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.770
 possible for more than failed 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.229
 reply the same day entered days 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.690
 henrique if not, I'll try another day 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.990
 Beauty guys, that's it, I'll stay 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.470
 here until the next video a hug and 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.470
 bye
