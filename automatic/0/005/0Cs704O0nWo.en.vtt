but<00:03:03.030> when<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.270> wrap<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.630> yarn<00:03:03.660> around<00:03:03.989> our

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
but when to wrap the yarn around our

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.370 
but when to wrap the yarn around our
needle<00:03:04.500> two<00:03:04.860> times<00:03:05.630> okay<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:06.930> pull<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.170> right

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
needle two times okay so pull it right

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.830 
needle two times okay so pull it right
through<00:03:07.520> like<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:09.570> we're<00:03:09.660> going<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
through like so then we're going to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.280 
through like so then we're going to
bring<00:03:10.080> our<00:03:10.230> yarn<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.650> front<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.310> we<00:03:11.820> will<00:03:12.290> purl

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
bring our yarn in front and we will purl

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.620 
bring our yarn in front and we will purl
five<00:03:13.680> together<00:03:13.920> again<00:03:14.580> wrapping<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.600> yarn

five together again wrapping the yarn

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.199 
five together again wrapping the yarn
around<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.170> needle<00:03:16.260> twice<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> we'll<00:03:21.060> do<00:03:21.180> that

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
around the needle twice so we'll do that

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.120 
around the needle twice so we'll do that
again<00:03:22.459> knit<00:03:24.080> five<00:03:25.080> together<00:03:25.350> wrapping<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
again knit five together wrapping the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.000 
again knit five together wrapping the
yarn<00:03:26.160> twice<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.080> get<00:03:31.200> pretty<00:03:31.410> tight<00:03:31.709> so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
yarn twice this can get pretty tight so

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.110 
yarn twice this can get pretty tight so
make<00:03:32.190> sure<00:03:32.220> you're<00:03:32.400> not<00:03:32.459> wrapping<00:03:32.790> too

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
make sure you're not wrapping too

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.710 
make sure you're not wrapping too
tightly<00:03:34.580> pearl<00:03:35.580> five<00:03:35.880> together<00:03:36.120> wrapping

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
tightly pearl five together wrapping

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.060 
tightly pearl five together wrapping
twice<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:39.060> we'll<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.360> one<00:03:39.600> more<00:03:39.830> where<00:03:40.830> we

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
twice and we'll do one more where we

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.500 
twice and we'll do one more where we
knit<00:03:41.340> five<00:03:41.640> together<00:03:44.030> wrapping<00:03:45.030> twice<00:03:45.269> so

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
knit five together wrapping twice so

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.300 
knit five together wrapping twice so
we've<00:03:45.660> created<00:03:45.840> five<00:03:46.350> new<00:03:46.620> stitches<00:03:46.920> here

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.979 

okay<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.760> we<00:03:53.880> wrapped<00:03:54.150> all<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.450> them<00:03:54.750> two

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
okay and we wrapped all of them two

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.930 
okay and we wrapped all of them two
times<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.299> look<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.870> little<00:03:57.989> bit<00:03:58.200> funky<00:03:58.380> but

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
times so I look a little bit funky but

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.670 
times so I look a little bit funky but
that's<00:03:59.940> okay<00:04:00.209> we'll<00:04:00.390> deal<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.320> on<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
that's okay we'll deal with that on the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.890 
that's okay we'll deal with that on the
next<00:04:01.950> row<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:02.370> now<00:04:02.519> we're<00:04:02.700> going<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.910> start<00:04:03.720> our

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
next row so now we're going to start our

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.620 
next row so now we're going to start our
repeat<00:04:04.320> by<00:04:04.350> knitting<00:04:04.470> one<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.549> we're<00:04:06.540> gonna

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
repeat by knitting one and we're gonna

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
repeat by knitting one and we're gonna
do<00:04:06.780> another<00:04:07.130> cluster<00:04:08.130> five<00:04:08.690> here

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.170 

so<00:04:13.769> we're<00:04:13.920> slip<00:04:14.129> these<00:04:14.310> over<00:04:14.640> dropping<00:04:14.939> the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
so we're slip these over dropping the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.659 
so we're slip these over dropping the
second<00:04:15.510> loop<00:04:16.160> we<00:04:17.160> wall<00:04:18.799> transform<00:04:19.799> them<00:04:19.979> over

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
second loop we wall transform them over

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.110 
second loop we wall transform them over
together

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
together

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.460 
together
and<00:04:21.500> then<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.650> will<00:04:22.919> knit<00:04:24.229> five<00:04:25.229> together

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
and then we will knit five together

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.890 
and then we will knit five together
wrapping<00:04:26.039> two<00:04:26.220> times

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.260 

okay<00:04:30.900> then<00:04:31.199> purl<00:04:31.500> five<00:04:31.860> together<00:04:32.220> make<00:04:33.150> sure

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
okay then purl five together make sure

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.520 
okay then purl five together make sure
you<00:04:33.389> do<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.750> real<00:04:34.020> loose<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:39.259> knit<00:04:40.259> five

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
you do this real loose a knit five

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:49.610 
you do this real loose a knit five
together<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:45.410> then<00:04:46.410> purl<00:04:46.860> five<00:04:47.160> together<00:04:48.620> and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
together and then purl five together and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.500 
together and then purl five together and
we're<00:04:49.830> wrapping<00:04:50.160> two<00:04:50.460> times<00:04:50.760> every<00:04:51.150> single

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
we're wrapping two times every single

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.469 
we're wrapping two times every single
time<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:54.410> knit<00:04:55.410> five<00:04:55.650> together<00:04:56.039> to<00:04:56.970> finish<00:04:57.180> it

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
time and knit five together to finish it

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.960 
time and knit five together to finish it
off<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.050> we'll<00:04:58.919> repeat<00:04:59.220> this<00:04:59.400> sequence<00:04:59.580> all

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
off and we'll repeat this sequence all

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.689 
off and we'll repeat this sequence all
the<00:05:00.270> way<00:05:00.389> until<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:00.810> reach<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.050> last<00:05:01.770> two

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
the way until we reach the last two

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.300 
the way until we reach the last two
stitches<00:05:03.199> in<00:05:04.199> our<00:05:04.500> row<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:06.889> to<00:05:07.889> finish<00:05:08.130> up

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
stitches in our row and to finish up

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.260 
stitches in our row and to finish up
when<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.580> get<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:08.849> last<00:05:09.030> two<00:05:09.240> stitches

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
when we get to the last two stitches

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.110 
when we get to the last two stitches
we're<00:05:09.810> going<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.110> knit<00:05:10.380> two<00:05:13.099> row<00:05:14.099> four<00:05:14.430> we're

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
we're going to knit two row four we're

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.670 
we're going to knit two row four we're
going<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.389> begin<00:05:15.630> by<00:05:15.900> purling<00:05:16.560> two<00:05:21.530> then<00:05:22.530> we're

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
going to begin by purling two then we're

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.659 
going to begin by purling two then we're
going<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.419> knit<00:05:24.419> five<00:05:25.169> dropping<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.280> extra

going to knit five dropping the extra

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.610 
going to knit five dropping the extra
loop<00:05:26.880> on<00:05:27.090> each<00:05:27.330> stitch<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:28.260> we're<00:05:28.349> just<00:05:28.380> going

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
loop on each stitch so we're just going

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:37.310 
loop on each stitch so we're just going
to<00:05:29.090> knit<00:05:30.090> as<00:05:30.389> normal

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320

to<00:05:38.320> each<00:05:38.470> one<00:05:38.680> of<00:05:38.710> these<00:05:38.890> loops<00:05:42.930> okay<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.350> then

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
to each one of these loops okay and then

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.070 
to each one of these loops okay and then
we<00:05:44.740> will<00:05:45.540> begin<00:05:46.540> our<00:05:46.570> next<00:05:46.720> repeat<00:05:47.530> by<00:05:47.800> purling

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
we will begin our next repeat by purling

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.620 
we will begin our next repeat by purling
one<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.320> then<00:05:50.890> we<00:05:51.010> will<00:05:51.040> knit<00:05:51.430> five<00:05:51.670> dropping

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
one and then we will knit five dropping

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:08.570

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.580 

today<00:06:09.120> we'll<00:06:09.330> repeat<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.780> sequence<00:06:09.990> all<00:06:10.380> the
