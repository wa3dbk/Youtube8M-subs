we have an heirloom apple tree
we're<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> look<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> few<00:00:09.870> things

we're going to look for a few things

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.720 
we're going to look for a few things
that<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.410> want<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.710> get<00:00:10.830> accomplished<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.519> this

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730

that we want to get accomplished on this
tree<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.900> we're<00:00:13.049> looking<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.530> any

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
tree one is we're looking for any

that are possibly coming right back into
the<00:00:17.670> tree<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.090> rubbing<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.960> another<00:00:19.230> branch

the tree and rubbing in another branch

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.170 
the tree and rubbing in another branch
we're<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> want<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.550> eliminate<00:00:20.760> those

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
we're going to want to eliminate those

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.370 
we're going to want to eliminate those
because<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.600> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> become<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.050> spot

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
because it's going to become a spot

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.130 
because it's going to become a spot
where<00:00:22.619> again<00:00:23.430> insects<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.269> penetrate<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
where again insects can penetrate and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.810 
where again insects can penetrate and
damage<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> other<00:00:26.189> branch<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.699> I'm

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
damage the other branch so I'm

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.120 
damage the other branch so I'm
sacrificing<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.720> branch<00:00:28.019> right<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.320> it's

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
sacrificing this branch right here it's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.349 
sacrificing this branch right here it's
going<00:00:29.369> straight<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.699> doesn't<00:00:30.029> prove<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
going straight up doesn't prove a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.240 
going straight up doesn't prove a
purpose<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:31.260> also<00:00:31.380> trying<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> open<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
purpose we're also trying to open a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.780 
purpose we're also trying to open a
canopy<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> allow<00:00:33.030> wind<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> come<00:00:33.660> through<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
canopy to allow wind to come through and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
canopy to allow wind to come through and
sunlight<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.120> help<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.540> ripening<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
sunlight which will help in ripening the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
sunlight which will help in ripening the
apples<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.010> keep<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> pests<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
apples and and keep down the pests and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.420 
apples and and keep down the pests and
diseases<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.410> we're<00:00:40.530> opening<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.309> little

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
diseases so we're opening it up a little

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
diseases so we're opening it up a little
bit<00:00:41.730> where<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> branches

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bit where we have a lot of the branches

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.299 
bit where we have a lot of the branches
that<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> center<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> aren't

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that are in the center that aren't

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
that are in the center that aren't
serving<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> purpose<00:00:44.930> getting<00:00:45.930> rid<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> those

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
serving a purpose getting rid of those

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.819 
serving a purpose getting rid of those
to<00:00:46.559> open<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> canopy<00:00:48.289> some<00:00:49.289> eliminating

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to open the canopy some eliminating

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
to open the canopy some eliminating
those<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:51.149> also<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> watch<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.960> for

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
those you also can watch out for

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
those you also can watch out for
branches<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.620> might<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:53.340> prone<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.730> little

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
branches that might be prone to little

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
branches that might be prone to little
damage<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> lawnmowers<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.440> don't<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
damage from the lawnmowers I don't like

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
damage from the lawnmowers I don't like
my<00:00:55.829> branches<00:00:56.280> too<00:00:56.489> long<00:00:56.870> makes<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> difficult

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
my branches too long makes it difficult

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
my branches too long makes it difficult
to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> long<00:00:58.770> morning<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
to get a long morning so I'm going to be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.799 
to get a long morning so I'm going to be
eliminating<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> ones<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.600> going

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
eliminating the ones that are going

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
eliminating the ones that are going
straight<00:01:01.050> down<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.609> ones<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.940> are

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
straight down and the ones that are

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.859 
straight down and the ones that are
going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.780> incredibly<00:01:04.290> low<00:01:05.840> has<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
going to be really incredibly low has a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
going to be really incredibly low has a
little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.439> damage<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> from<00:01:08.369> rubbing

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
little bit of damage on it from rubbing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
little bit of damage on it from rubbing
on<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.090> type<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.330> machine<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
on some type of machine so I'm going to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
on some type of machine so I'm going to
take<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> saw<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:12.330> did<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> close

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
take out the saw and how did this close

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.710 
take out the saw and how did this close
to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> trunk<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.920> possibly<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:17.720> eliminate

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
to the trunk as I possibly can eliminate

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.990 
to the trunk as I possibly can eliminate
that<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.799> any<00:01:19.979> water<00:01:20.250> sprouts<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that one and any water sprouts that are

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
that one and any water sprouts that are
coming<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.360> through<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> tree<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.920> base

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
coming up through the tree on the base

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.359 
coming up through the tree on the base
those<00:01:23.520> should<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.729> eliminated<00:01:24.390> also<00:01:25.220> work<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
those should be eliminated also work on

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.109 
those should be eliminated also work on
those<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.799> watch<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.400> pruning<00:01:29.759> for

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
those and watch and then pruning for

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.749 
those and watch and then pruning for
height<00:01:30.920> we're<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.189> directional

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
height we're going to do directional

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.190 
height we're going to do directional
pruning<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> branches

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
pruning so we can have the branches

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.929 
pruning so we can have the branches
we'll<00:01:34.380> start<00:01:34.829> taking<00:01:35.189> off<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.460> direction<00:01:35.850> you

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
we'll start taking off in direction you

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
we'll start taking off in direction you
want<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.740> already

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
want it so like on this one it's already

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
want it so like on this one it's already
getting<00:01:38.189> too<00:01:38.369> low<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> coming<00:01:39.150> too<00:01:39.270> close<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
getting too low and coming too close to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.090 
getting too low and coming too close to
this<00:01:39.780> other<00:01:39.960> tree<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> limonade

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this other tree I'm going to limonade

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
this other tree I'm going to limonade
right<00:01:41.340> above<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.979> bud<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.409> I'm

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
right above the bud and go like this I'm

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.450 
right above the bud and go like this I'm
going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> limonade<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.340> coming

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
going to limonade the one that's coming

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.240 
going to limonade the one that's coming
straight<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> height<00:01:49.950> here

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
straight up so as we get to height here

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.130 
straight up so as we get to height here
to<00:01:51.979> look<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:53.460> branching<00:01:54.000> here

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
to look for some of these branching here

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.069 
to look for some of these branching here
and<00:01:55.140> prune<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.619> above<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.040> bud<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:57.930> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and prune right above a bud so now this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.510 
and prune right above a bud so now this
is<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> predominant<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.280> I'm

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
is going to be the predominant but I'm

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
is going to be the predominant but I'm
not<00:01:59.640> real<00:01:59.850> crazy<00:02:00.060> about<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.710> direction<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
not real crazy about that direction but

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.940 
not real crazy about that direction but
it<00:02:02.159> should<00:02:02.369> work<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.729> now<00:02:03.770> eliminating<00:02:04.770> some

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it should work for now eliminating some

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
it should work for now eliminating some
of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> height<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:05.850> by<00:02:06.210> getting<00:02:06.479> some

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
of the height here also by getting some

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.000 
of the height here also by getting some
of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> canopy<00:02:07.200> in

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
of the canopy in

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.660 
of the canopy in
and<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.430> is<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.940> tree<00:02:09.150> basics
