 [Music] 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.470
 the static simulation in anatomy has 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.510
 demonstration objectives that facilitate the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.860

 appreciation of structures 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.870
 anatomical allows you to see and touch with a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:53.159
 high degree of realism

 [Music] 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.180
 learning is strengthened by experiencing 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.580
 the theory where the goal is the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.550
 teaching specific skills such as 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.369
 scanning auscultation palpation 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.100
 these are developed in the area of 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.620
 physical examination and semiology a space 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.080
 wide dynamic that allows mounting

 [Music] 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.290
 like in a real emergency room this 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.420
 space allows the entry and delivery of 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.040

 [Music] 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.500
 The simulation of surgery is composed 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.989
 for a supply of surgical equipment 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.519
 of the latest technology they provide 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.890
 behavioral tools in 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.849

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:04.680
 [Music] 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.590
 and the technological endowment of the center of 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.760
 state- of-the-art simulation allows 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.280
 the student interact with the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.980
 medical and paramedical equipment before 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.320
 your exposure to reality this provides 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.260
 greater confidence and security at the moment 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.920
 to use them later 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.650
 [Music] 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.380
 in this way we reaffirm the 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.750
 knowledge and learning based on 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.790
 practice and experience in environments 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.050
 simulated in the prehospital areas 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.050
 and hospitable
