00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
with pretty much no fight at all I

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.740 
with pretty much no fight at all I
didn't<00:01:43.220> even<00:01:43.340> put<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.550> to<00:01:43.610> sleep<00:01:46.570> still<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
didn't even put it to sleep still the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.480 
didn't even put it to sleep still the
crazy<00:01:47.990> Pokemon<00:01:48.440> logic<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:48.950> anything<00:01:49.369> can

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
crazy Pokemon logic that anything can

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.219 
crazy Pokemon logic that anything can
break<00:01:49.640> out<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:50.000> poke<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.300> ball<00:01:50.420> when<00:01:51.050> it's

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.969 
break out of a poke the ball when it's
asleep<00:01:53.080> well<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.110> guess<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.619> does<00:01:54.740> make<00:01:54.950> sense

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
asleep well I guess it does make sense

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.390 
asleep well I guess it does make sense
me<00:01:55.400> if<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.910> are<00:01:56.030> disturbing<00:01:56.390> your<00:01:56.600> sleep<00:01:56.660> you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
me if you are disturbing your sleep you

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.910 
me if you are disturbing your sleep you
kind<00:01:58.400> of<00:01:58.460> move<00:01:58.610> around<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.030> lot<00:01:59.150> if<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.420> then<00:02:00.200> do

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
kind of move around a lot if you then do

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.450 
kind of move around a lot if you then do
kind<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.220> do<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.430> subconsciously<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.119> guess

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
kind of do that subconsciously I guess

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.460 
kind of do that subconsciously I guess
