finished<00:00:05.460> creating<00:00:06.410> this<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:07.740> elevator

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
finished creating this is an elevator

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.749 
finished creating this is an elevator
that<00:00:08.490> goes<00:00:08.700> both<00:00:09.300> up<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.990> down<00:00:10.370> made<00:00:11.370> out<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that goes both up and down made out of

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.609 
that goes both up and down made out of
pistons<00:00:12.410> I'm<00:00:13.410> pretty<00:00:14.040> proud<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.580> this

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
pistons I'm pretty proud of this

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.840 
pistons I'm pretty proud of this
somebody<00:00:16.619> commented<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.550> my<00:00:17.670> videos

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
somebody commented on one of my videos

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.230 
somebody commented on one of my videos
and<00:00:18.480> asked<00:00:19.080> me<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.289> build<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> tutorial

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and asked me to build and do a tutorial

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.230 
and asked me to build and do a tutorial
of<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.890> figured<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.519> know<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
of one and I figured you know what that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.750 
of one and I figured you know what that
sounds<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.930> fun<00:00:25.260> task<00:00:25.590> I've<00:00:25.949> seen<00:00:26.279> piston

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
sounds like a fun task I've seen piston

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
sounds like a fun task I've seen piston
elevators<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.630> different<00:00:27.810> types<00:00:28.230> i

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
elevators of all different types i

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.220 
elevators of all different types i
suppose<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> i<00:00:29.730> haven't<00:00:30.599> seen<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> goes

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
suppose and i haven't seen one that goes

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
suppose and i haven't seen one that goes
down<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.219> was<00:00:32.460> probably<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.360> biggest

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
down so that was probably the biggest

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.220 
down so that was probably the biggest
hurdle<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> overcome<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.399> i<00:00:36.020> did<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.110> with

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
hurdle to overcome but i did it with

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.959 
hurdle to overcome but i did it with
brute<00:00:37.530> force<00:00:37.559> i<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.460> give<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> tutorial

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
brute force i will give you a tutorial

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.360 
brute force i will give you a tutorial
soon<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.079> i'm<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.500> demonstrate<00:00:40.739> for

I'll<00:01:17.580> give<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> flight<00:01:18.330> through<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
I'll give you a flight through it you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.300 
I'll give you a flight through it you
get<00:01:19.710> pushed<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.720> over<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
get pushed up one and then over one and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
get pushed up one and then over one and
then<00:01:23.460> push<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> over<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.340> pushed

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
then push it up one and over one pushed

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.080 
then push it up one and over one pushed
up<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.240> over<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:28.049> push<00:01:28.710> type<00:01:28.920> 1<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.759> 1

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
up one and over one push type 1 over 1

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
up one and over one push type 1 over 1
you<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> picture<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.220> then

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you get the picture for that and then

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.499 
you get the picture for that and then
coming<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.650> it<00:01:34.650> pushed<00:01:35.070> over<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
coming down it pushed over one and you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
coming down it pushed over one and you
just<00:01:36.540> fall<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.470> an<00:01:37.680> already<00:01:37.829> collapse

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just fall down into an already collapse

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
just fall down into an already collapse
for<00:01:38.579> floor<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.540> push<00:01:39.990> down<00:01:40.020> another<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
for floor and push down another and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.999 
for floor and push down another and
another<00:01:41.220> another<00:01:41.909> another<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.750> another<00:01:43.009> now

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
another another another in another now

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.450 
another another another in another now
it<00:01:44.189> takes<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.759> point<00:01:45.630> eight<00:01:45.869> seconds<00:01:46.590> per<00:01:47.070> block

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
it takes a point eight seconds per block

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.240 
it takes a point eight seconds per block
of<00:01:47.939> high<00:01:48.659> gain<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.750> could<00:01:51.899> tell

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
of high gain to go up as you could tell

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.540 
of high gain to go up as you could tell
it's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.579> slower<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.119> up

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.480 

though<00:01:57.550> pointing<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.150> second<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.690> her<00:01:58.870> level

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
though pointing a second to her level

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.650 
though pointing a second to her level
but<00:02:00.490> going<00:02:00.940> down<00:02:01.480> it's<00:02:01.930> like<00:02:02.680> point<00:02:03.130> for<00:02:03.660> half

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
but going down it's like point for half

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.380 
but going down it's like point for half
the<00:02:04.900> time<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.530> go<00:02:05.680> down<00:02:05.890> because<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:07.210> don't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
the time to go down because you don't

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.359 
the time to go down because you don't
have<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.140> two-step<00:02:08.650> mechanism<00:02:08.920> to

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
have to have the two-step mechanism to

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.450 
have to have the two-step mechanism to
push<00:02:09.640> yourself<00:02:10.060> up<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.540> over<00:02:11.100> but<00:02:12.100> I'll<00:02:12.280> give

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
push yourself up and over but I'll give

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
after a point for second delay powers

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.920 
after a point for second delay powers
the<00:02:26.350> next<00:02:26.590> block<00:02:26.710> then<00:02:27.520> comes<00:02:28.300> over<00:02:28.720> and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
the next block then comes over and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.320 
the next block then comes over and
powers<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:30.010> block<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.610> push<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.970> up<00:02:31.120> one

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
powers the up block to push you up one

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.720 
powers the up block to push you up one
more<00:02:31.600> but<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.770> loop<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.250> also<00:02:33.520> going

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
more but then that loop is also going

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.390 
more but then that loop is also going
through<00:02:33.820> with<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.300> three<00:02:34.660> delay<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.320> then<00:02:36.160> that

through with a three delay and then that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.220 
through with a three delay and then that
comes<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.030> powers<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.600> next<00:02:37.840> block<00:02:37.960> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
comes up and powers the next block to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.260 
comes up and powers the next block to
push<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.590> over<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.520> still<00:02:39.760> goes<00:02:39.970> through

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
push you over and it still goes through

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.780 
push you over and it still goes through
with<00:02:40.420> another<00:02:40.690> delay<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:42.160> next<00:02:42.430> block<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
with another delay the next block to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.090 
with another delay the next block to
push<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.570> another<00:02:43.870> delay<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.440> 0

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
push you up then another delay of 0

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.250 
push you up then another delay of 0
point<00:02:45.310> for<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.450> next<00:02:46.720> block<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.080> push

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
point for with the next block to push

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.340 
point for with the next block to push
you<00:02:47.440> over<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.570> get<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.690> picture<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.170> how

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
you over and you get the picture of how

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.120 
you over and you get the picture of how
this<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.800> working<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.400> goes<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.060> spiral<00:02:53.130> up

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
this is working it goes in a spiral up

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.030 
this is working it goes in a spiral up
the<00:02:54.970> entire<00:02:55.360> thing<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.740> kind<00:02:56.980> of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
the entire thing and then you kind of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.070 
the entire thing and then you kind of
got<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.250> modify<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.790> for<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.300> last<00:02:58.540> block<00:02:58.900> to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
got to modify it for the last block to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.870 
got to modify it for the last block to
push<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.440> out<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.920> ground<00:03:00.190> level<00:03:00.550> because

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
push you out on the ground level because

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.620 
push you out on the ground level because
that's<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.270> way<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.930> enables<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.630> go

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
that's the way that it enables you to go

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.770 
that's the way that it enables you to go
down<00:03:04.930> smoothly<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:06.610> then<00:03:07.000> when<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.390> push

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
down smoothly but then when you push

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.490 
down smoothly but then when you push
this<00:03:07.989> button<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.410> go<00:03:08.650> down<00:03:08.860> all<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
this button to go down all of the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.750 
this button to go down all of the
Pistons<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.680> brought<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.070> up<00:03:12.100> are<00:03:12.430> already

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
Pistons that brought you up are already

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.150 
Pistons that brought you up are already
collapsed<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.440> button<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:14.920> going<00:03:15.100> to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
collapsed so that button is going to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.040 
collapsed so that button is going to
power<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.640> source<00:03:16.000> which<00:03:16.360> comes<00:03:16.690> through

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
power this source which comes through

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.720 
power this source which comes through
and<00:03:17.170> powers<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.770> block<00:03:17.980> right<00:03:18.310> here<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
and powers the block right here that

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.330 
and powers the block right here that
pushes<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.300> out<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.660> first<00:03:19.930> time<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.410> then

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
pushes you out the first time and then

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.130 
pushes you out the first time and then
it<00:03:21.459> goes<00:03:21.640> through<00:03:21.910> another<00:03:22.150> series<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.810> point

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
it goes through another series of point

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.540 
it goes through another series of point
for<00:03:23.440> tick<00:03:23.800> delays<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.830> these<00:03:26.980> blocks<00:03:27.310> that

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
for tick delays all of these blocks that

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.670 
for tick delays all of these blocks that
push<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.209> our<00:03:28.420> hidden<00:03:28.660> because<00:03:29.110> these

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
push you out our hidden because these

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.270 
push you out our hidden because these
are<00:03:30.600> redstone<00:03:31.600> wire<00:03:31.810> running<00:03:32.320> on<00:03:32.560> top<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.190> a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
are redstone wire running on top of a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.580 
are redstone wire running on top of a
block<00:03:33.430> makes<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.180> source<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.660> power<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.440> all

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
block makes it a source of power so all

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.290 
block makes it a source of power so all
the<00:03:35.860> Pistons<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.400> push<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.910> out<00:03:37.060> are<00:03:37.270> behind

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
the Pistons that push you out are behind

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.449 
the Pistons that push you out are behind
these<00:03:37.810> blocks<00:03:38.170> in<00:03:38.410> succession<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.160> still

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
these blocks in succession but still

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.540 
these blocks in succession but still
going<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.420> follow<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.810> loop<00:03:41.110> all<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.769> way<00:03:42.250> down

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
going to follow a loop all the way down

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.460 
going to follow a loop all the way down
and<00:03:42.850> you<00:03:42.910> got<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.180> be<00:03:43.239> careful<00:03:43.420> not<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.140> cross

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and you got to be careful not to cross

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.229 
and you got to be careful not to cross
wires<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:45.280> what<00:03:45.430> not<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.380> how<00:03:48.239> it's

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
wires and what not and that is how it's

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.380 
wires and what not and that is how it's
gonna<00:03:49.360> work<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.280> obviously<00:03:51.370> be<00:03:51.850> cleaned

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
gonna work this can obviously be cleaned

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.190 
gonna work this can obviously be cleaned
up<00:03:52.660> hidden<00:03:53.440> fairly<00:03:54.280> easily<00:03:54.489> but<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.480> will<00:03:55.989> show

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
figured I'd show you how it works so one

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.780 
figured I'd show you how it works so one
