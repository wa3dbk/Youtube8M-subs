it what why these are better than
regular<00:00:46.829> booster<00:00:47.280> packs<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
boxes because there's no set ratio so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.770 
boxes because there's no set ratio so
you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.489> pull<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.820> three<00:00:51.059> secrets<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> know
