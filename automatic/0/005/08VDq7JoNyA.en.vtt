00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
joined the Navy and that means I've

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.359

in<00:02:34.239> terms<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.750> around<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.200> pond<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.700> actions

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
in terms of around the pond the actions

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.949 
in terms of around the pond the actions
improved<00:02:37.510> slightly<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.280> grasses<00:02:39.840> started<00:02:40.840> to

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
improved slightly the grasses started to

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.170 
improved slightly the grasses started to
grow<00:02:41.140> right<00:02:41.380> up<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.799> edge<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.940> hoping

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
grow right up to the edge I'm hoping

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.220 
grow right up to the edge I'm hoping
that<00:02:43.420> will<00:02:43.540> continue<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:45.430> improve<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
that will continue to improve now the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.059 
that will continue to improve now the
waterfall<00:02:47.680> I'm<00:02:48.639> really<00:02:48.940> happy<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.329> lately<00:02:50.069> I

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
waterfall I'm really happy with lately I

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.460 
waterfall I'm really happy with lately I
planted<00:02:51.940> some<00:02:52.030> ivy<00:02:52.540> around<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.079> edge<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
planted some ivy around the edge of the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.830 
planted some ivy around the edge of the
waterfall<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.970> started<00:02:55.359> to<00:02:55.510> creep

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
waterfall and it started to creep

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.629 
waterfall and it started to creep
actually<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.680> waterfall<00:02:57.130> itself<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.519> it's

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
actually on the waterfall itself so it's

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.490 
actually on the waterfall itself so it's
starting<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.000> look<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.180> bit<00:03:01.209> more<00:03:01.359> more<00:03:01.989> natural

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
starting to look a bit more more natural

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.590 
starting to look a bit more more natural
like<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:02.829> been<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.549> longer<00:03:04.329> than

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
like it's been there for longer than

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.520 
like it's been there for longer than
just<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.930> couple<00:03:05.139> of<00:03:05.230> years<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:07.139> today<00:03:08.139> is<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.960 

but<00:03:33.230> yeah<00:03:33.410> hopefully<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.550> year<00:03:34.790> I'm<00:03:34.880> gonna

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
but yeah hopefully this year I'm gonna

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.390 
but yeah hopefully this year I'm gonna
put<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.570> bit<00:03:35.960> more<00:03:35.990> effort<00:03:36.170> into<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.770> pond<00:03:37.010> get

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
put a bit more effort into the pond get

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.940 
put a bit more effort into the pond get
it<00:03:37.490> looking<00:03:37.760> nice<00:03:37.970> how<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.330> used<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.080> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
it looking nice how it used to and the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.580 
it looking nice how it used to and the
water<00:03:40.160> is<00:03:40.490> still<00:03:40.820> pretty<00:03:41.060> clear<00:03:41.590> that's

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
water is still pretty clear that's

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.670 
water is still pretty clear that's
mainly<00:03:42.950> due<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.900> all<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.170> allured<00:03:45.530> yeah

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
mainly due to the all the allured yeah

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.650 
mainly due to the all the allured yeah
I've<00:03:45.800> got<00:03:45.980> here<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:47.120> actually<00:03:47.420> plan<00:03:47.630> on

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
I've got here and actually plan on

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.270 
I've got here and actually plan on
keeping<00:03:47.960> it<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.320> way<00:03:48.530> does<00:03:48.950> look<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.130> little

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
keeping it this way does look a little

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.230 
keeping it this way does look a little
bit<00:03:49.490> messy<00:03:49.820> with<00:03:49.850> all<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.300> in<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:52.090> think<00:03:53.090> as

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
bit messy with all this in I think as

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.060 
bit messy with all this in I think as
long<00:03:53.360> as<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.540> have<00:03:53.660> more<00:03:53.840> than<00:03:53.960> 50%<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.860> pond

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
long as I have more than 50% of the pond

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.520 
long as I have more than 50% of the pond
covered<00:03:55.520> by<00:03:55.670> this<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.840> should<00:03:57.080> keep<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.260> rest

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
covered by this it should keep the rest

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.470 
covered by this it should keep the rest
of<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.740> water<00:03:57.890> pretty<00:03:58.370> clear<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.760> depth<00:04:02.060> in

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
of the water pretty clear the depth in

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
conservatory and that's where it gets

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:35.999 
conservatory and that's where it gets
its<00:04:25.670> power

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.869

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
and hopefully we should get some blooms

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.529 
and hopefully we should get some blooms
