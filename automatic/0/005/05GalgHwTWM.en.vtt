00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
they noticed or not the players in the

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.890 
they noticed or not the players in the
game<00:03:49.079> but<00:03:49.410> yeah<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.600> won't<00:03:51.720> be

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
skin will be the only distinction of who

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.310 
skin will be the only distinction of who
you<00:03:56.489> are<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.750> way<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.930> could<00:03:58.140> actually
