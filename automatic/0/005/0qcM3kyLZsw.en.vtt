the towel with me so you can see exactly
where<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:41.129> many<00:00:41.190> miles<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.700> car

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
where it is and how many miles on my car

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.779 
where it is and how many miles on my car
ok<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:45.059> oil<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.079> did<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
ok so the oil that I just did so this is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.110 
ok so the oil that I just did so this is
the<00:00:47.940> full<00:00:48.539> mark<00:00:49.460> okay<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:52.579> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> empty

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the full mark okay and this is the empty

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.290 
the full mark okay and this is the empty
mark<00:00:54.420> over<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:55.010> right<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.219> head<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.180> touch

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
mark over here right here head and touch

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
mark over here right here head and touch
it<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> oil<00:00:58.230> level<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> side

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it so the oil level is here on this side

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.479 
it so the oil level is here on this side
and<00:00:59.719> on<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.899> side<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.770> only<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.309> here

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and on this side it's only down to here

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
and on this side it's only down to here
so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.840> closer<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.949> this

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so I have to take the closer to so this

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.640 
so I have to take the closer to so this
is<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.280> point<00:01:05.610> 8<00:01:05.850> quarts<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.720> would<00:01:07.530> say

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650

miles<00:01:36.990> I've<00:01:37.259> burned<00:01:37.770> almost<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.220> quart<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.549> oil

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
miles I've burned almost a quart of oil

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
miles I've burned almost a quart of oil
and<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.600> speeding<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.200> rapidly<00:01:40.979> because

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and this is speeding up rapidly because

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
and this is speeding up rapidly because
the<00:01:41.369> last<00:01:41.520> time<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.049> 3,000<00:01:43.049> miles<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.350> point

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the last time a 3,000 miles about point

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.420 
the last time a 3,000 miles about point
eight<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:44.040> only<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.479> even<00:01:45.720> 3,000<00:01:46.290> miles<00:01:46.439> I'm

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
eight now only not even 3,000 miles I'm

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.200 
eight now only not even 3,000 miles I'm
already<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.770> one<00:01:49.770> quart<00:01:50.100> low<00:01:50.399> almost<00:01:51.060> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
already at a one quart low almost one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.469 
already at a one quart low almost one
quart<00:01:51.450> low<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.290> again<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.820> verify<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
quart low so again just verify this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.160 
quart low so again just verify this
again<00:01:55.130> put<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.219> in

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.190 

and<00:02:01.369> take<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.490> over<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:02.970> so<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.020> see

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and take this over here so you can see

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.940 
and take this over here so you can see
exactly<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:04.890> list<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.830> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
exactly what that list is on the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.330 
exactly what that list is on the
dipstick<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.849> there's<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.390> top<00:02:10.259> side<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
dipstick so there's the top side and is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.500 
dipstick so there's the top side and is
the<00:02:11.459> bottom<00:02:11.760> side<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:14.550> definitely<00:02:15.209> about

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the bottom side so it's definitely about

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.160 
the bottom side so it's definitely about
yeah<00:02:16.500> 3/4<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.280> way<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.630> about<00:02:18.750> 3/4

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
yeah 3/4 the way down so it's about 3/4

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.820 
yeah 3/4 the way down so it's about 3/4
of<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.380> quart<00:02:19.620> low

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
of a quart low

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.400 
of a quart low
based<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.150> instructed<00:02:21.480> by<00:02:21.720> subaru

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
based on what I was instructed by subaru
