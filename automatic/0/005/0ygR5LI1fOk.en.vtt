figured<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:10.019> now<00:03:12.170> well<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.379> contains<00:03:14.150> an<00:03:15.150> AC

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
figured out now well it contains an AC

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.699

adapter the pins not suitable for the
Indian<00:03:20.250> power<00:03:20.609> socket<00:03:21.150> but<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.420> guess<00:03:21.719> an

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
Indian power socket but I guess an

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.190

adapter<00:03:22.469> will<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:22.980> trick<00:03:23.989> now<00:03:24.989> we<00:03:25.049> have

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
adapter will do the trick now we have

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.479 
adapter will do the trick now we have
another<00:03:25.290> pin<00:03:25.739> which<00:03:26.219> I<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.549> have<00:03:26.959> swept

seen apart from my wife of course so

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.720 
seen apart from my wife of course so
there's<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:18.380> device<00:05:18.650> you<00:05:18.980> can<00:05:19.100> take<00:05:19.250> a<00:05:19.280> look<00:05:19.520> at

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
there's a device you can take a look at

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.810 
there's a device you can take a look at
on<00:05:20.420> all<00:05:20.960> sides<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:22.070> front<00:05:22.400> with

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
on all sides of it this is a front with

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.290 
on all sides of it this is a front with
an<00:05:23.920> it's<00:05:24.920> supposed<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.310> be<00:05:25.430> an<00:05:25.520> LED<00:05:25.820> indicator

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
an it's supposed to be an LED indicator

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.760 
an it's supposed to be an LED indicator
but<00:05:26.540> it's<00:05:26.660> so<00:05:26.810> small<00:05:27.230> that<00:05:27.290> you<00:05:27.530> cannot

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
but it's so small that you cannot

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.650 
but it's so small that you cannot
probably<00:05:28.160> see<00:05:28.400> it<00:05:31.180> right<00:05:32.180> now<00:05:34.240> on<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.420> back

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
probably see it right now on the back

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.970 
probably see it right now on the back
side<00:05:37.750> as<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:38.870> can<00:05:38.990> see<00:05:39.200> you<00:05:39.440> have<00:05:39.590> an<00:05:39.830> ethernet

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
side as you can see you have an ethernet

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.110 
side as you can see you have an ethernet
port<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:41.090> power<00:05:41.950> socket<00:05:42.950> and<00:05:43.160> use<00:05:43.670> people<00:05:44.090> for

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
port the power socket and use people for

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.840 
port the power socket and use people for
connecting<00:05:44.840> or<00:05:45.140> attaching<00:05:45.560> more<00:05:46.160> network

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
connecting or attaching more network

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.310 
connecting or attaching more network
devices<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:49.490> on<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:49.850> top<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:51.310> have<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:53.480> slot

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
devices and on the top you have the slot

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320 
devices and on the top you have the slot
for<00:05:54.620> inserting<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.370> hard<00:05:55.610> disks<00:05:56.060> and<00:05:56.210> I

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
for inserting the hard disks and I

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.560 
for inserting the hard disks and I
suppose<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:57.050> can<00:05:57.920> be<00:05:57.950> opened<00:05:58.760> just<00:05:59.300> like

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
suppose this can be opened just like

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.950 
suppose this can be opened just like
this<00:05:59.780> so<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:01.460> can<00:06:01.640> see<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:01.970> hard<00:06:02.420> disks

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
this so you can see the hard disks

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.640 
this so you can see the hard disks
inside<00:06:03.910> I'll<00:06:04.910> give<00:06:05.060> a<00:06:05.090> more<00:06:05.270> detailed<00:06:05.930> video

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
inside I'll give a more detailed video

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.380
