what I call a badge shape design and I

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.609 
what I call a badge shape design and I

shape of a v-twin engine and that's what

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.250 
shape of a v-twin engine and that's what
I<00:02:24.760> was<00:02:24.910> inspired<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.510> do<00:02:25.660> when<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.900> designed

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
I was inspired to do when I designed

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.430 
I was inspired to do when I designed
this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.780 
this
filter<00:02:26.680> additionally<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:27.640> about

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
filter additionally if you think about

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.400 
filter additionally if you think about
the<00:02:27.940> fact<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.570> filter<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> way<00:02:29.230> we

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the fact that this filter the way we

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.320 
the fact that this filter the way we
designed<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:29.950> rather<00:02:30.160> thin<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.180> has

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
designed it is rather thin and that has

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.390 
designed it is rather thin and that has
great<00:02:31.660> ergonomic<00:02:32.230> value<00:02:32.560> because<00:02:32.920> when<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
great ergonomic value because when you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340 
great ergonomic value because when you
get<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.670> your<00:02:33.790> motorcycle<00:02:33.940> no<00:02:34.660> more<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.200> your
