00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.039 

okay<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.030> then<00:01:59.210> our<00:01:59.299> next<00:01:59.329> ingredient<00:01:59.689> is

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
okay and then our next ingredient is

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.399 
okay and then our next ingredient is
going<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.380> seat<00:02:00.590> old<00:02:00.740> sea<00:02:01.130> salt<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.610> taste

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
but we usually don't prefer sea salt

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.840 
but we usually don't prefer sea salt
because<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.409> already<00:02:06.560> has<00:02:06.679> its<00:02:07.310> natural

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
because it already has its natural

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.870 
because it already has its natural
flavor<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.840> without<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.729> our

stirring it's within the firm and then

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.240 
stirring it's within the firm and then
our<00:03:14.140> next<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.500> green<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.799> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.069> 1

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
our next in green is going to be 1

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:52.690

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.000 

okay<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:53.989> last<00:03:54.260> we're<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.860> add

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
okay and then last we're going to add

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.940 
okay and then last we're going to add
one<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.720> one<00:03:56.720> fourth<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.290> cup<00:03:57.319> of<00:03:57.500> water<00:03:57.800> to

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:19.729 

for<00:04:12.410> them<00:04:12.590> again

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.529 

and<00:04:20.069> you<00:04:20.430> might<00:04:20.579> need<00:04:20.699> a<00:04:20.759> bigger<00:04:21.030> pan<00:04:21.329> than

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
and you might need a bigger pan than

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:28.219 
and you might need a bigger pan than
this<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.019> doesn't<00:04:22.079> overflow<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:27.229> we're

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
this so it doesn't overflow and we're

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.350 
this so it doesn't overflow and we're
just<00:04:28.349> going<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.620> let<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.740> simmer<00:04:29.069> for<00:04:29.360> it's

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
just going to let it simmer for it's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.150 
just going to let it simmer for it's
gonna<00:04:30.509> probably<00:04:30.810> take<00:04:31.020> about<00:04:31.229> 10<00:04:31.530> min<00:04:31.710> system

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
gonna probably take about 10 min system

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.890 
gonna probably take about 10 min system
I<00:04:32.280> until<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.000> starts<00:04:33.270> looking<00:04:33.569> like<00:04:33.599> it

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
I until it starts looking like it

ketchup<00:04:36.800> okay<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:37.979> that<00:04:38.160> took<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.460> little

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
ketchup okay so that took a little

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.480 
ketchup okay so that took a little
longer<00:04:38.940> than<00:04:39.240> 10<00:04:39.449> minutes<00:04:39.690> but<00:04:40.259> this<00:04:41.099> is<00:04:41.280> about

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
longer than 10 minutes but this is about

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.339 
longer than 10 minutes but this is about
