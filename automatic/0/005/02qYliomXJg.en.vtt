from here to this edge here you know
from<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:21.000> edge<00:01:21.659> along<00:01:22.080> here

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
from this top edge along here

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.330 
from this top edge along here
there'll<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.430> camera<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.150> see<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
there'll be camera if you can see it I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
there'll be camera if you can see it I
generally<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.210> inch<00:01:27.420> from

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
generally come down about one inch from

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950 
generally come down about one inch from
there<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> top<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.909> edge<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
there to the top of that edge there it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.330 
there to the top of that edge there it
looks<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.560> neat<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
looks really neat so if you get that

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
looks really neat so if you get that
straight<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.130> distance<00:01:35.130> from

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
straight and you get this distance from

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.050 
straight and you get this distance from
here<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:37.220> not<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.430> half<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.850> down

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060

here to here not about half way down
here<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
here to here pretty right well then you

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
here to here pretty right well then you
generally<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.460> set<00:01:41.700> pretty<00:01:41.850> good<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:43.229> come

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
generally is set pretty good to come

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.690 
generally is set pretty good to come
around<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.770> inch<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.640> the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
you see that edge on the guard there to
this<00:02:04.170> top<00:02:04.469> edge<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:04.979> I'll<00:02:05.460> draw<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> line

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this top edge here I'll draw the line

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.059 
this top edge here I'll draw the line
and<00:02:06.799> then<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:09.319> their<00:02:10.319> momentum<00:02:10.619> tape

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and then from their momentum tape

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.730 
and then from their momentum tape
measure<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:12.360> 180<00:02:12.660> over

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
measure it's 180 over

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.910 
measure it's 180 over
185<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.640> 180<00:02:17.640> far<00:02:17.970> from<00:02:18.360> there<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:19.650> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
185 so that 180 far from there to that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.230 
185 so that 180 far from there to that
texture<00:02:20.310> mark<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> front<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> guard

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
texture mark on the front of the guard

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.700 
texture mark on the front of the guard
there<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:22.080> about<00:02:22.820> 205<00:02:24.470> people<00:02:25.470> take<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
there or about 205 people take a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.750 
there or about 205 people take a
millimeter<00:02:26.810> from<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.960> back<00:02:28.140> edge<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.100> yeah<00:02:29.310> do

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
millimeter from the back edge so yeah do

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.480 
millimeter from the back edge so yeah do
it<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> same<00:02:30.180> top<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.690> bottom<00:02:31.220> from<00:02:32.220> memory

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
it the same top and bottom from memory

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.340 
it the same top and bottom from memory
note<00:02:32.640> 65<00:02:33.360> from<00:02:34.200> there<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:36.960> there

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
note 65 from there so that like there

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.670 
note 65 from there so that like there
yeah<00:02:37.800> there<00:02:38.130> we<00:02:38.370> go

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
yeah there we go

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.590 
yeah there we go
no<00:02:40.680> no<00:02:40.890> no<00:02:41.130> don't<00:02:41.310> 150<00:02:41.760> something<00:02:42.060> oh<00:02:42.150> maybe<00:02:42.480> I

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
no no no don't 150 something oh maybe I

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000 
no no no don't 150 something oh maybe I
want<00:02:42.810> how<00:02:43.080> they<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.320> went<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> edge<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
want how they go went to the edge of the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.770 
want how they go went to the edge of the
flute<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.910> get<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> measurement<00:02:45.420> anyway

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
flute but you get a measurement anyway

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.260 
flute but you get a measurement anyway
so<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.530> front<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.090> your

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
so if you get this front is this is your

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.100 
so if you get this front is this is your
datum<00:02:50.150> because<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.420> fairly<00:02:51.660> straight

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
datum because it's a fairly straight

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
datum because it's a fairly straight
line<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.470> there<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.620> we're<00:02:55.620> gonna<00:02:55.710> prove<00:02:55.950> this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
line in there and we're gonna prove this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.730 
line in there and we're gonna prove this
other<00:02:56.310> measurement<00:02:56.790> for<00:02:56.940> ya<00:03:00.320> there<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:01.530> in

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
other measurement for ya there you go in

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.480 
other measurement for ya there you go in
2025<00:03:02.610> over<00:03:02.940> there<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.300> say<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:04.490> yeah

what looks like they sit that way do
those<00:03:42.360> holes<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:43.020> so<00:03:44.300> line<00:03:45.300> that<00:03:45.600> up<00:03:45.920> that's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
those holes like so line that up that's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.680 
those holes like so line that up that's
how<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> look<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:50.070> what<00:03:50.190> do<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.340> think<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:50.820> said

like I said got a Mon on eBay there's

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.100 
like I said got a Mon on eBay there's
plenty<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.770> manufacturers<00:04:59.370> making<00:04:59.639> all<00:04:59.910> these

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
plenty of manufacturers making all these

you<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.290> get<00:05:01.410> both<00:05:01.650> these<00:05:01.950> from<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.400> one<00:05:02.580> kit

you can get both these from the one kit

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.610 
you can get both these from the one kit
but<00:05:03.240> there<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.600> find<00:05:04.050> them<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.260> be<00:05:04.290> very

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
but there I find them to be very

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.210 
but there I find them to be very
expensive<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:06.570> other<00:05:06.750> ones<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.229> have<00:05:07.260> on<00:05:07.680> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
expensive the other ones I have on the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.219 
expensive the other ones I have on the
other<00:05:08.250> car<00:05:08.610> they<00:05:09.030> are<00:05:09.210> actually<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:10.139> original

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
other car they are actually the original

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.190 
other car they are actually the original
cast<00:05:10.889> oil<00:05:11.400> ones<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.820> think<00:05:12.750> there<00:05:12.840> may<00:05:13.020> be<00:05:13.050> a

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
cast oil ones I think there may be a

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.800 
cast oil ones I think there may be a
little<00:05:13.380> bit<00:05:13.620> better<00:05:13.830> quality<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:15.510> feel

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
little bit better quality to the feel

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.170 
little bit better quality to the feel
and<00:05:16.169> that<00:05:16.440> but<00:05:16.680> these<00:05:16.860> look<00:05:17.430> pretty<00:05:17.700> genuine

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
and that but these look pretty genuine

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.420 
and that but these look pretty genuine
pretty<00:05:18.570> good<00:05:18.720> I'm<00:05:19.680> happy<00:05:19.979> with<00:05:20.100> them<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.370> I'm

pretty good I'm happy with them so I'm

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.279 
pretty good I'm happy with them so I'm

we<00:06:41.250> different<00:06:41.730> different<00:06:42.510> shape<00:06:42.720> in<00:06:42.900> here<00:06:43.080> so

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
we different different shape in here so

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.690 
we different different shape in here so
to<00:06:43.350> save<00:06:43.560> myself<00:06:43.740> a<00:06:43.980> lot<00:06:44.010> of<00:06:44.220> work<00:06:44.370> I've

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
to save myself a lot of work I've

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.810 
to save myself a lot of work I've
decided<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.590> this<00:06:46.590> is<00:06:46.650> all<00:06:47.040> pretty<00:06:47.250> good<00:06:47.490> so

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
decided that this is all pretty good so

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.170 
decided that this is all pretty good so
why<00:06:47.970> I<00:06:48.000> cut<00:06:48.330> all<00:06:48.540> this<00:06:48.720> off<00:06:48.990> and<00:06:49.260> start<00:06:49.500> again

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
why I cut all this off and start again

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.660 
why I cut all this off and start again
when<00:06:51.180> I<00:06:51.240> just<00:06:51.570> did<00:06:51.750> some<00:06:51.960> measurements<00:06:52.110> and
