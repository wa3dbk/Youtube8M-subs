with<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.620> way<00:04:40.650> it's<00:04:40.830> progressing<00:04:40.979> and<00:04:41.789> he

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
with the way it's progressing and he

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.520 
with the way it's progressing and he
made<00:04:42.030> an<00:04:42.180> attacking<00:04:42.449> substitution

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
made an attacking substitution

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.260 
made an attacking substitution
later<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:44.070> when<00:04:44.280> Jordy<00:04:44.669> came<00:04:44.880> on<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.240> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
later on when Jordy came on for a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.430 
later on when Jordy came on for a
defender<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.900> paid<00:04:46.080> off<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.349> the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
defender and it paid off on the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.400 
defender and it paid off on the
straightaway<00:04:46.860> there<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.340> thought<00:04:47.669> that<00:04:47.729> maybe

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
straightaway there I thought that maybe

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
straightaway there I thought that maybe
sometimes<00:04:49.410> we<00:04:49.650> were<00:04:49.800> dropping<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.130> little<00:04:50.190> bit

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
sometimes we were dropping a little bit

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.770 
sometimes we were dropping a little bit
deep<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:50.849> I<00:04:50.880> thought<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.389> know<00:04:51.479> we<00:04:51.599> thought

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
deep so I thought you know we thought

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.570 
deep so I thought you know we thought
possibly<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.800> may<00:04:52.949> well<00:04:53.160> be<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.430> we

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
possibly that it may well be that we

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.920 
possibly that it may well be that we
swap<00:04:53.849> would<00:04:53.940> defend<00:04:54.240> her<00:04:54.330> off<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.660> put<00:04:54.810> an

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
swap would defend her off and put an

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.439 
swap would defend her off and put an
extra<00:04:55.169> striker<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.889> occupy<00:04:56.430> their<00:04:57.180> full

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
extra striker on to occupy their full

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.909 
extra striker on to occupy their full
bucks<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.020> think<00:04:58.259> that<00:04:58.410> works<00:04:58.650> out<00:04:58.860> really

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
bucks and I think that works out really

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.710 
bucks and I think that works out really
well<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.340> thought<00:04:59.639> we<00:05:00.000> left<00:05:00.389> for<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.570> up

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
well I thought we left for the up

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.719 
well I thought we left for the up
occupied<00:05:01.470> their<00:05:01.680> back<00:05:01.860> forward<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.280> stay<00:05:02.460> back

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
occupied their back forward to stay back

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.820 
occupied their back forward to stay back
and<00:05:02.880> then<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.570> know<00:05:03.690> we<00:05:03.870> were<00:05:03.960> able<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.320> deal

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
and then you know we were able to deal

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.990 
and then you know we were able to deal
with<00:05:05.009> anything<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.340> came<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.729> other<00:05:05.789> way

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
with anything that came the other way

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.610 
with anything that came the other way
