actual project would be this is not the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830 
actual project would be this is not the
whole<00:01:13.380> shebang<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> make<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.720> too

the<00:02:07.439> beginning<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> after<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> mapped<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the beginning so after I mapped out the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.370 
the beginning so after I mapped out the
width<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.150> again<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:13.020> just

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
width and again it's just

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.770 
width and again it's just
20<00:02:13.590> boxes<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.730> make<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.090> 30<00:02:15.450> or

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
20 boxes here but you can make it 30 or

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.480 
20 boxes here but you can make it 30 or
40<00:02:16.170> when<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.440> actually<00:02:16.620> cast<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.310> your

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
40 when you actually cast on your

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.100 
40 when you actually cast on your
needles<00:02:17.820> or<00:02:18.810> your<00:02:19.200> hook<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:21.300> put<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.050> know

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
needles or your hook and I put in I know

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
needles or your hook and I put in I know
for<00:02:22.440> sure<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.830> want<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.310> border<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
for sure that I want a border because I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
for sure that I want a border because I
knit<00:02:24.600> very<00:02:24.840> tightly<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.440> sometime<00:02:25.830> my

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
knit very tightly and sometime my

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.730 
knit very tightly and sometime my
products<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:26.850> projects<00:02:27.720> start<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.050> curl<00:02:28.380> at

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
products my projects start to curl at

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.800 
products my projects start to curl at
the<00:02:29.250> end<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:29.910> very<00:02:30.150> good<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the end so it's very good to have a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.640 
the end so it's very good to have a
border<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.910> all<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.450> normally<00:02:33.840> knit<00:02:34.080> from

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
border so we all we normally knit from

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.840 
border so we all we normally knit from
right<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.550> left<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:37.170> that's<00:02:37.380> why<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.830> my<00:02:38.190> 1

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
right to left so that's why I have my 1

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.450 
right to left so that's why I have my 1
to<00:02:39.030> indicate<00:02:39.420> my<00:02:39.630> row<00:02:39.870> these<00:02:40.710> numbers<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
to indicate my row these numbers on the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.540 
to indicate my row these numbers on the
side<00:02:41.670> or<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> row<00:02:42.200> same<00:02:43.200> thing<00:02:43.380> here<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.800> I

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
side or the row same thing here and I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.910 
side or the row same thing here and I
put<00:02:44.760> RS<00:02:45.240> 4<00:02:45.930> right<00:02:46.110> side<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> did<00:02:46.770> this

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
put RS 4 right side and I did this

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
put RS 4 right side and I did this
merely<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.490> guys<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.880> demonstration

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
merely for you guys for demonstration

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.200 
merely for you guys for demonstration
number<00:02:49.440> 2<00:02:49.800> represents<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.550> wrong<00:02:50.730> side<00:02:51.000> all

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
number 2 represents the wrong side all

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.730 
number 2 represents the wrong side all
these<00:02:51.360> even<00:02:51.750> numbers<00:02:52.020> represent<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> wrong

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
these even numbers represent the wrong

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.170 
these even numbers represent the wrong
side<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.540> basically<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> knit<00:02:56.610> Row

1<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.630> I'm<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.320> knit<00:02:58.500> row<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.090> row<00:03:00.090> 3<00:03:00.420> I'm

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
1 and I'm going to knit row to row 3 I'm

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.790 
1 and I'm going to knit row to row 3 I'm
just<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.020> to<00:03:01.050> knit<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> first<00:03:01.530> two

a different icon maybe I'll make an open
circle<00:04:23.130> with<00:04:23.250> nothing<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.910> or<00:04:24.120> maybe<00:04:24.630> I

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
circle with nothing in it or maybe I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.260 
circle with nothing in it or maybe I
decide<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.230> make<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.590> line<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.520> icons<00:04:26.970> are<00:04:27.150> up

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
decide to make a line the icons are up

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.690 
decide to make a line the icons are up
to<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> great<00:04:28.950> way<00:04:29.250> when<00:04:29.550> this

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
is all filled in to show you this is

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.890 
is all filled in to show you this is
what<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.370> will<00:04:32.490> look<00:04:32.670> like<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.750> also

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
what it will look like you can also

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.220 
what it will look like you can also
decide<00:04:34.260> okay<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.920> was<00:04:35.820> thinking<00:04:36.180> maybe<00:04:36.360> what

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
decide okay I was thinking maybe what

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.480 
decide okay I was thinking maybe what
maybe<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.560> want<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.770> do<00:04:37.890> checkered<00:04:38.310> board

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
maybe you want to do checkered board

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.880 
maybe you want to do checkered board
right<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.180> want<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.480> see<00:04:39.740> what<00:04:40.740> it's

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
right and you want to see what it's

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.640 
right and you want to see what it's
going<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.100> look<00:04:41.160> like<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.870> divide<00:04:43.290> your

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
going to look like so you divide your

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.200 
going to look like so you divide your
graph<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.610> half<00:04:46.430> I'll<00:04:47.430> stop<00:04:47.730> right<00:04:47.940> up<00:04:47.970> to

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
graph in half I'll stop right up to

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.830 
graph in half I'll stop right up to
there<00:04:48.420> or<00:04:48.540> something<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:50.630> come<00:04:51.630> across<00:04:51.930> here

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
there or something and come across here

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.530 
there or something and come across here
and<00:04:55.580> let's<00:04:56.580> say<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:57.030> want<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.420> go

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
and let's say that you want to go

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.080 
and let's say that you want to go
another<00:04:57.810> ten<00:04:58.110> rows<00:04:58.380> up<00:04:58.710> here<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.070> 30<00:04:59.310> so<00:04:59.910> from

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
another ten rows up here to 30 so from

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.330 
another ten rows up here to 30 so from
20<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.420> 30<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:01.740> want<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.010> do<00:05:02.100> something

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
20 to 30 you want to do something

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.190 
20 to 30 you want to do something
completely<00:05:03.030> different<00:05:03.060> it's<00:05:03.630> like<00:05:03.810> an<00:05:03.990> open

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
completely different it's like an open

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.500 
completely different it's like an open
it's<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:06.680> you<00:05:07.680> know<00:05:07.880> it's<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:09.180> use

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
it's like a a you know it's just use

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.840 
it's like a a you know it's just use
your<00:05:09.690> imagination<00:05:10.340> let's<00:05:11.340> say<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.520> want<00:05:11.790> to

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
your imagination let's say you want to

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.700 
your imagination let's say you want to
do<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.270> pattern<00:05:12.750> that's<00:05:12.870> different<00:05:13.230> in<00:05:13.410> this

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
do a pattern that's different in this

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.580 
do a pattern that's different in this
box<00:05:14.010> then<00:05:14.430> then<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.300> box<00:05:15.570> you<00:05:16.230> want<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.470> have

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
box then then this box you want to have

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.530 
box then then this box you want to have
like<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.800> diagonal<00:05:17.310> thing<00:05:17.760> going<00:05:18.030> on<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:18.330> it's

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
like a diagonal thing going on so it's

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.900 
like a diagonal thing going on so it's
like<00:05:18.660> checkers<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.920> you<00:05:20.010> do<00:05:20.220> stuff<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:20.550> this

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
like checkers so you do stuff like this

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.190 
like checkers so you do stuff like this
and<00:05:21.300> it's<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.320> cool<00:05:22.500> way<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:23.660> again<00:05:24.660> design

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
and it's just a cool way to again design

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.320 
and it's just a cool way to again design
and<00:05:25.560> play<00:05:25.770> with<00:05:25.920> your<00:05:26.070> imagination<00:05:26.640> you<00:05:27.210> know

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
areas are very helpful when designing
