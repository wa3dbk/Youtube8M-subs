an<00:01:49.410> engine<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> ship<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> University

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
an engine and ship it to the University

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.070 
an engine and ship it to the University
then<00:01:52.980> with<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> help<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.150> students<00:01:54.600> the
