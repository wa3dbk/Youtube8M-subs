00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.730
 I know if I said right and wrong to do the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.350
 this mode is useful for many things 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.070

 I do not know anything like that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.520
 Like the bad side said mody here is that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.290
 he needs to have his own cars 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 for him type is not any car that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.710
 works on it has to have the cars 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.619
 but you know that you're referring to me 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.119
 doing now is new vehicles to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.750
 gt sandes 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
 I'm going to start putting it next week. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.970
 Any Tuesday? 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.880
 I think it's the day I'm going to put it on. 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 start putting cars that are 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.530
 compatible with this motto so that you 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.439
 You can use a little gallery. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.480
 so come on, the motto will come like this 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:09.190
 folder for you here 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.310
 instead of killing, I found the site 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.890
 do gta tnt which is a very good site for 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:21.180
 you download modis and I'll leave the link 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.070
 in the description for you to download 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:33.660
 So I came to the folder 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:36.600
 You come in here and you pick up and copy this 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.980
 file here 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.590
 these files you get copies do 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.460
 control and control v both you and you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.290
 enter the folder of gta san andreas 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.000
 for those who do not know how to enter this folder is 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 very simple you come here in the area of 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.580
 Where is the icon to enter? 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.660
 in the game you are to click the button 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:08.020
 right-click and click Open Location 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.620
 the file is ready you entered the folder 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.470
 gta 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 I'm not sure if these files 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 which will be replaced here in this 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.480
 will have already in the gta by chance that in the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.310
 My gt here is already installed. 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.330
 I do not know if I have you before 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.180
 replace your files 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.440
 the files you are replacing you with 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.540
 back up to those who do not know 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.300
 It is to wait for the files to that 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.890
 if it does not work legg something 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.739
 which I do not like to uninstall 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.350
 simply put the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 files again so it does not happen 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:52.830
 Nothing wrong, it's okay, so you pick it up. 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.890
 and paste in this folder the gta root folder 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:01.400
 that copying this override has replaced 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 It 's very easy to start there. 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.200
 but there are people who can not right you 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.019
 there are some people who have a little 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.720
 more difficulty 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.909
 all right here you click the folder models 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.169
 that you here or at the moment am in 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:21.019
 backyard folder mode centric modules 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.900
 generic and vehicles 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.560

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:43.610
 they feel motors generic and you take and glue 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.699
 who to replace replace with 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.699

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.610
