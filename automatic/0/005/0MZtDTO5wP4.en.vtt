00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.029
 to 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.120
 this is a wedding napkin ring and you're going to 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.120
 see how we do it 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 here we have the napkin ring that we are going to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.830
 decorate is from these fan of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.840
 half Moon 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.930
 I'm going to cut in shape 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.040
 a silhouette of this fan as well as 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.840
 is 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.840
 that are two better said 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:53.140
 here I already have two because the bar is already 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.559
 of organza delgadito with shore 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.540
 and what I'm going to take off strips like that 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.310
 in diagonal 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.770
 of this ribbon 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.680
 to put 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.680
 some droplets like that in sequence maybe 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 and there we have 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.490
 another one that keep putting like this parallel 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.659
 until what 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.659
 then I can fit 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.550
 yes 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.490
 and then I'm going to make sense 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.079
 contrary 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.920
 the same one another another and so it goes to 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.920
 be a grid 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.659
 and this lattice will be left now what 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.250
 I'm going to pair well I'm going to cut all 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.250
 these leftovers from the banks 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.440
 I 'm staying has already trimmed down here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.720
 this team shore 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.720
 She is very pretty and elegant 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.190
 and you already know that with silicone 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.910
 there 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.450
 we will pass on the ends the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.080
 Senate calls because they say the h 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.900
 there we go well 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 this is an application 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.400
 the metallic plastic are rings of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.099
 weddings a symbol of the union of the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.099
 I'm going to paste it here 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.830
 and when I have these two pieces like this 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.340
 I'm going to put them in my napkin holder 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.340
 with silicone 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.870
 for word 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.239
 the outline 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.129
 and in any of these 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.720
 hopscotch 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.980
 has to adjust exactly I 'm going to 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.970
 Put upside down 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.970
 to see well 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.730
 there is 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.010
 that is not perfect now I'm going to put the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.439
 another one I also have them well pegaditos 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.439
 and one more thing is missing 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.070
 that is a box of foami equal 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 yes 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:32.100
 and I'm going to put it here 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.100
 in the seat 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.000
 of the napkin ring fits me exactly 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.000
 long and of the year 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.730
 these are clean pipes of long hair and 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.960
 very thick they even have the wire 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.420
 harder than normal 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.330
 the common 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.300
 let's make some bows like this 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.500
 the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.500
 and we are going to paste them 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.340
 but 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.640
 I think this is the measure that I need 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.880
 I have them like that 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.880
 before paying the ones I'm going to fluff 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.180
 what sponge we say that d 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.180
 cute 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.150
 I'm going to stop them here back 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.630
 ah 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.630
 and here I go 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.280
 the silicone 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.419
 here it is 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.419
 the clean people 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.910
 and it is already 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.880
