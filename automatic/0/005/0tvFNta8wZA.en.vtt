00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
running in a hypervisor so what we've

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.670 
running in a hypervisor so what we've
got<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.820> running<00:01:08.150> on<00:01:08.240> Windows<00:01:08.540> 8<00:01:08.720> here<00:01:08.960> Windows

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.060 
got is running on Windows 8 here Windows
8<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.159> supporting<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.760> as<00:01:10.880> an<00:01:11.060> application<00:01:12.070> and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
8 is supporting it as an application and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.500 
8 is supporting it as an application and
what<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:13.580> could<00:01:13.730> call<00:01:13.880> it's<00:01:14.030> like<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.210> software

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
what you could call it's like a software

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.570 
what you could call it's like a software
hypervisor<00:01:15.110> within<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.920> Windows<00:01:16.460> 8

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
hypervisor within a Windows 8

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.700 
hypervisor within a Windows 8
application<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:17.510> within<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
application and then within that the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.770 
application and then within that the
Android<00:01:19.280> builds<00:01:19.670> runs<00:01:19.940> like<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.300> kind<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
Android builds runs like a kind of a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.780 
Android builds runs like a kind of a
well<00:01:21.650> similar<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.130> another<00:01:22.220> solution<00:01:22.580> we've

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
well similar to another solution we've

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.820 
well similar to another solution we've
seen<00:01:22.970> from<00:01:23.180> from<00:01:23.390> BlueStacks<00:01:23.870> so<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:24.680> can

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
seen from from BlueStacks so we can

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.790 
seen from from BlueStacks so we can
switch<00:01:25.100> into<00:01:25.430> juice<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.060> both<00:01:26.870> solutions<00:01:27.320> are

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
switch into juice and both solutions are

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.480 
switch into juice and both solutions are
running<00:01:28.430> at<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.820> same<00:01:29.000> time<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:29.570> if<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.720> go<00:01:29.900> into

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
running at the same time so if I go into

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.460 
running at the same time so if I go into
Android<00:01:31.490> will<00:01:31.850> start<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.360> Angry<00:01:32.810> Birds<00:01:33.020> up<00:01:33.320> we

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
Android will start to Angry Birds up we

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.289 
Android will start to Angry Birds up we
can<00:01:33.620> see<00:01:33.770> that's<00:01:33.950> that's<00:01:34.460> running<00:01:34.880> here<00:01:35.120> if<00:01:35.210> I

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
can see that's that's running here if I

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.300 
can see that's that's running here if I
come<00:01:35.540> out<00:01:35.659> into<00:01:35.810> Windows<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.070> can<00:01:37.190> actually

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
come out into Windows you can actually

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.280 
come out into Windows you can actually
see<00:01:37.610> two<00:01:37.820> are<00:01:38.000> still<00:01:38.330> running<00:01:38.510> there

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
see two are still running there

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.530

system<00:01:59.540> but<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.190> would<00:02:01.310> advise<00:02:01.550> running<00:02:02.180> on

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
system but so it would advise running on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.969 
system but so it would advise running on
a<00:02:02.300> core<00:02:02.570> rather<00:02:02.870> than<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.170> page<00:02:03.350> show<00:02:03.560> but<00:02:03.740> we'll

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
a core rather than a page show but we'll

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.070 
a core rather than a page show but we'll
see<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.250> can<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.760> test<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:05.690> on<00:02:05.900> Bay

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
see we can get a test of this on on Bay

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.850 
see we can get a test of this on on Bay
Trail<00:02:06.380> soon

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.070 

you<00:02:10.399> can<00:02:10.580> see<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:10.880> 4.2.2

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.470 

and<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:15.740> giving<00:02:16.010> us<00:02:16.100> access<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.850> wireless

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
and it's giving us access to wireless

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.150 
and it's giving us access to wireless
network<00:02:18.430> Ethernet<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.840> other<00:02:20.890> features<00:02:21.890> of

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
network Ethernet and other features of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.500 
network Ethernet and other features of
the<00:02:22.670> hardware<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.690> underlying<00:02:23.900> system

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.899 

so<00:02:28.050> let's<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.349> minimize<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.370> app<00:02:29.610> there

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
so let's just minimize it that app there

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.360 
so let's just minimize it that app there
it's<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.019> if<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.010> just

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.729 

the<00:02:34.940> application<00:02:35.659> starts<00:02:36.110> as<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.379> Windows

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
the application starts as a Windows

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.770 
the application starts as a Windows
desktop<00:02:36.980> app<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.519> not<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.700> modern<00:02:38.330> app<00:02:38.540> I

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
desktop app it's not a modern app I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.050 
desktop app it's not a modern app I
think<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.110> saw<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:39.500> -<00:02:39.739> somewhere<00:02:40.549> around<00:02:40.670> here

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
think I saw it - somewhere around here

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.410 
think I saw it - somewhere around here
where<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.780> there<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.159> app<00:02:43.420> shown

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
where is it there it is as the app shown

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.720 
where is it there it is as the app shown
under<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.319> modern<00:02:45.500> user<00:02:45.860> interface

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
under the modern user interface

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.000 
under the modern user interface
so<00:02:48.270> that's<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.660> small<00:02:48.810> overview<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.800> what

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
so that's just a small overview of what

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.729 
so that's just a small overview of what

moment there's a number of beta testers
looking<00:02:56.459> at<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.730> Jewess<00:02:57.420> download<00:02:57.950> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
looking at this Jewess download and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.000 
looking at this Jewess download and
american<00:02:59.430> megatrends<00:02:59.580> have<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.830> view<00:03:01.830> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
american megatrends have a view to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.210 
american megatrends have a view to

bringing this to director consumers via
direct<00:03:05.220> download<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.019> not<00:03:07.260> something

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
