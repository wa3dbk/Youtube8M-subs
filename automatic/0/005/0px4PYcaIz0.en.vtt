00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.720
 hi my loves today I'm going to try a 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.580
 color corrector that asked me one of 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.980
 absences and is that if I drop the 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.550
 hair, you know who to blame 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.500
 let's see how it is going 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.690
 you already know very important and the first thing that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.850
 they have to be because it's reading very well 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.359
 here it simply says to mix the 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.880
 part 1 and 2 to equal amounts that you 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.920
 apply it on all the hair and that you 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.260
 leave it for approximately 20 minutes 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.679
 with a hat and that can also 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.319
 give heat what I liked about this color 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.789
 sex or of this arranged color 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.489
 good is that it comes in several languages 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.190
 including Spanish so there is no 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.440
 loses also brings instructions for 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.899
 if you do not want to remove all the color if 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.329
 not just a very light change 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.489
 they also say everything here and as 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.979
 I always tell because the most important thing 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.139
 is to read and this time that I 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.049
 I behaved well judgment is well judicious 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:03.079
 girls and how I showed them at the beginning 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.329
 I tested myself on a lock and 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.320
 apparently it's going to be good and 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.120
 as you see 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.909
 in this test of the lock because my kisses 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.490
 these rites are still intact here 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.250
 they have no product just what 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.590
 same and you see how they are and I'm going to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.630
 apply on all my hair well if I do not 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.640
 I fall but if I drop it because the fault 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.490
 It's from the girl who asked me how 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.490
 fix a color that does not like we go 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 mix according to the instructions 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.770
 you're going to start on my dry hair and go 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.770
 to apply this mixture on the hair in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.590
 which you want to fix the color either 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.740
 in a part either in the trunk either 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.439
 at the tips or wherever I want in this 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.360
 I'm going to use it on my hair 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.490
 complete and this I'm going to do girls 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.670
 because I'm doing this after 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.250
 that I put on the blue color and although I 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.769
 he liked it a lot already is becoming 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.260
 as green and the color looks very ugly and 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.209
 I do not like that very important in 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.780
 clean everything very well before it 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.690
 dry then rinse very well and proceed 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.209
 to take step number 3 I after this 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.140
 I rinse it and I liked pro treatment 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.140
 kitchen points 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.170
 I have already finished as they see the horse 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.800
 it's wet and clearly we're not going to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.640
 can appreciate very well that both of the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.670
 colors 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.540
 formerly they left but of all 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.570
 Well then, I notice a little 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.430
 less black already wearing a little less black 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.450
 and especially the faces because they are very 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.520
 visible 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.960
 on this occasion and to be able to appreciate it 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.000
 very beautiful, the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.090
 be that I'm going to study the humidity of my 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.670
 deep treatment that I put on and 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.010
 also of the water that you already know of 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.930
 all this and I will not put any other 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.079
 product and this for several reasons a 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.860
 to see how the hair was left without a 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.840
 without the effect of others from others 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.170
 products and second therefore 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.560
 logically because by making me this 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.189
 fix color or colorfix as I said 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.090
 the box is clearly already that 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.430
 all my desires because they are in sight 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.590
 quite visible let's see if yes I 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.989
 I can zoom in and you can see what 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.709
 means girls that of course 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.230
 I'm going to have to apply a color in 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.299
 the hair to cover the faces because 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.950
 They know that I'm wrong or I want it 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.329
 every time I do not want faces then 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.489
 Well, that's why I'm going to leave it like this 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.879
 so that my hair dried up 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.099
 totally and to apply a color 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.019
 permanent that I have out there that I want 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.209
 try and good then what better the 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.930
 opportunity that now that all the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.590
 fearsome gray hair are there yes yes then nothing 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.570
 that was all 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.920
 at the end of the video, I'm going to 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.340
 put one 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:28.140
 a few clicks to green as my hair is 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.350
 dry and the color difference or not 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.780
 color and so you can see this I will 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.810
 already with dry hair and in different 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.810
 lights today using me no light 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.430
 artificial I do not know if they can notice it but 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.580
 this is very important to be able 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.910
 better appreciate the color with the times 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.370
 the artificial lights for what I already think 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.010
 in what a little then when 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.520
 come out I'll show you and then 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.950
 also later at the end of the video and 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.710
 I hope you like them remember to read 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.540
 very well the instructions and they will 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.840
 use and in the description box 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.770
 everything will be there in the box says that 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.660
 this color arranger works better 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.900
 as light and has exposed a color 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.360
 permanent and not semi permanent is that 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.280
 has been what I have used in the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.120
 last 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.240
 months you could say well this is due 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.510
 that as it says here in the box says 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.450
 what one 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.720
 huanuni colorfix is ​​formulated to 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.130
 remove the oxidation dyes 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.530
 since most of the colors 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.670
 semi permanent are a combination of 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.370
 pure dyes and oxidation dyes 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.050
 colorfix will only remove it 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.470
 partially the latter what he wants 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.560
 say that he will not get all the cum 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.290
 permanent what I think happened in this 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.270
 but in our own way, well, I 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.300
 I am very happy and just so good 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.550
 you know this I did it for you 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.740
 they saw and if in case some 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.130
 good you pass your hand with the color 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.220
 but as always I say girls 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.770
 if you have the opportunity either by 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.870
 money by proximity or by whatever 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.540
 gone from a color specialist for 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.270
 this is always going to be the best thing but 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.240
 look like this color fix because it is very 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.850
 very safe since my curls are super 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.520
 but mega megas intact are very 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.420
 soft clear that I gave myself a treatment 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.360
 of proteins 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.420
 at the end of the application and before 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.750
 put the new dye on my hair 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.310
 all that as extra precaution I hope 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.130
 that you like the video you know 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.280
 compacted with her friends from sme likes 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:53.170
 or little fingers up and subscribe eat 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.170
 dewey see you in the next chao
