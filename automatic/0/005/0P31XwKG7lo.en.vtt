00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.600
 here 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.529
 Hello everyone, this is a continuation video about 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.369
 my idea of ​​keeping jewelery and 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.289
 accessories 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.259
 if you have not seen it then link 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.210
 will be down now I'll tell you how i am 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.439
 made just such a stand for rings 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.610
 do it yourself for just a few 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.230
 minutes, we need to box itself in 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.410
 principle you can use that 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.409
 it is pleasant to me this casket and in from under 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.770
 sweets yes there were very very tasty days 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.350
 candy and I felt sorry for throwing it away 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.930
 it is desirable that your casket and 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.390
 the future was high bumpers so will 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.449
 much more convenient especially if you have 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.149
 some volumetric rings will be stored 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.250
 we will also need decorative fabric 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.940
 the so-called decorative fabric then 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.809
 eat her we will then complete herself 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.929
 under the tree 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.910
 and also need any bulk fabric 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:12.100
 I basically have nothing like that 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.009
 use for example an old towel 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.580
 but my second towel was not found 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.970
 I used a floor cloth 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.610
 but it is new and clean and of course scissors 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.849
 of course so we take our turn 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.390
 a towel or in my case a rag for 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:34.539
 washing the floor, I deploy it and just 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.569
 measure the width of the box by eye here 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.599
 don't even need some kind of accuracy and even 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.599
 night cut off the strip along the entire length of 3 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:46.119
 I got a few such 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.209
 strips in my case 4 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.390
 I start to twist it is not tight here 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.450
 such a roller turned out and they 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.280
 it turned out 4 but I just have more 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.319
 four you can not mark 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.679
 if you have a bigger box 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.229
 accordingly you make more of these 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.440
 rollers do not invest these rollers in 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.440
 casket itself 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.210
 too navitel on tight ie if u 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.090
 you put one more means 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.970
 somehow tamp them and put them to 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 it was they who sat tight and just 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.210
 box size 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.460
 then you don't need to fix them in any way. 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.420
 anyway, you will not fall out 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.940
 I took this fabric and I bought it 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.160
 just for another crafts and I stayed 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.070
 shred just a little bit wider 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.250
 I cut the width of the roller strip and 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.980
 next with scissors I start this 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.790
 cloth and how to wrap this cloth 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.390
 rollers 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.390
 that's the way I do it with my hands 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.700
 scissors I have some flaws 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.490
 eliminated celebrate in decorative 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.290
 fabric to make it look nice and 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.720
 neat and here's a ready version 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.840
 as you can see in just a few minutes and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.790
 you have a ready-made box for rings under 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.310
 video I will leave links to other videos 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.120
 accessories and on my social network and see you
