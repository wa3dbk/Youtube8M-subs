00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.190
 hello xatakeros let's continue talking 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.870
 from photography the three parameters that 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.300
 allow us to control the exposure of 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.680
 our photographs when we use 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.809
 our photo camera or our 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.550
 smartphone are the aperture of the diaphragm 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.090
 and the sensitivity and time of 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.830
 exposition 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.690
 now we are going to delve into this last 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.170
 parameter the exposure time or the 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.170
 shutter speed 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.740
 the exposure time allows us 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.000
 control the time in seconds or 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.500
 fractions of a second that will be 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 exposed in our sensors 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.860
 the time that will be receiving light 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.940
 the sensor of our camera 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.559
 this is important that we have 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.290
 present because depending on the light 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.079
 environmental we can choose or we will have 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.600
 than choosing one value or another of time of 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.190
 exposure or shutter speed if 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.460
 we are taking an outdoor photo 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.420
 and the ambient light is intense 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.010
 logically the ideal will be to choose a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.449
 short exposure time so you do not 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.939
 there is an excess of light in the sensor that 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.500
 cause that the photo is left over 

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:58.360
 exposed that is that it has too much light 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.189
 and on the contrary if we are doing 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.619
 an indoor photograph with little 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.299
 ambient light the ideal in principle will be 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.340
 increase the exposure time to 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.200
 that the sensor is receiving more light 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.750
 time and our photo is not too little 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.310
 illuminated as we have seen the time of 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.439
 exhibition allows us to control with 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 very precise the time that will be 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.530
 exposed the sensor is to say the time 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.060
 that will be receiving light but 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.710
 we have to keep in mind that it influences 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.070
 also in another very important parameter 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.230
 and it is that if we are photographing or a 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.900
 static object 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.720
 a prolonged exposure time does not go 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.100
 to pose any problem but if 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.900
 we are photographing an object in 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.160
 movement for example if we are in a 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.540
 Car race we are doing 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.610
 photos of cars that are moving 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.230
 at a lot of speed a time of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.170
 very reduced exposure is going to 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.880
 allow to freeze those cars in that 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.940
 come out totally focused and sharp 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.710
 what will happen if we are doing 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.960
 photographs in a car race 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.370
 but the sky is very cloudy and we 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.350
 we have been forced to increase the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.960
 exposure time for cars 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.550
 they will leave moved because it will come out and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.710
 The cars moved will come out 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.210
 simply because the time of a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.680
 from which the sensor has been exposed 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.140
 car has been moving if 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.270
 we keep the sensor open you start 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.880
 exaggerating for three seconds in three 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.770
 seconds a formula one car 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 because many meters are moving that is 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.850
 the route that you will perform during 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.740
 the time in which we are taking the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.080
 photograph and you will see the car 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.880
 totally fuzzy that we can do 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.350
 to compensate for this in some way and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.450
 get the picture look 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.010
 that we want to play not only 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 with the exposure time but 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
 also with the opening of the diaphragm 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.140
 and the sensitivity the other two 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640
 parameters that allow us to control 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.769
 very accurately the exposure of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.540
 our photographs as we just 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.000
 see if what we want is to freeze a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.549
 object so that it remains 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.510
 completely clear in the image there 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.590
 leave moved 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.049
 we have to use times of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.060
 exposure very small fragments 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.349
 fractions of a second but there are also 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.150
 contexts in which we may be interested 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.980
 use more exposure times 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.390
 prolonged imagine two photographs 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.250
 different in which it can be 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.980
 desirable that the type of exposure be 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.000
 longer even several seconds 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.640
 let's imagine that we want to photograph a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.849
 waterfall and we want the water to have 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.370
 that silky appearance that causes water 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.930
 in motion is an appropriate context 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.239
 to use an exposure time 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.069
 prolonged several seconds if instead 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.959
 to shoot our picture with a 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.010
 second fraction 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.379
 We expose the sensor for two or three 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.060
 seconds the water will look like 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.920
 water in silky motion that is a 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.470
 very nice finish continuing with 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.819
 our example of water but from a 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.769
 different point of view if instead of 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.389
 want to say what we want is not 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.980
 stop the water moving the 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.510
 waterfall so it does not look like 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.410
 silky but what we want is to stop 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.120
 a drop of water 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.040
 for example that we can obtain it then 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.200
 by throwing a stone at a pond 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.300
 drops that will be fired for 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.730
 photograph a drop and stop it in the 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.290
 air that will be totally clear and not in 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.300
 movement we would have to use a 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.580
 very reduced exposure time 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.230
 only a fraction of a second we're going 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.850
 to put another interesting example in the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.470
 that it is also desirable to use 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.970
 Prolonged exposure times 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.560
 For example, taking a photograph of 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.390
 a city at night in which 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.270
 we want the lights of the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.580
 cars but not some lights totally 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.350
 arrested but those those wakes of 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.880
 moving salts that are quite 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.340
 nice here we also have to 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.320
 use an exposure time 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.630
 prolonged that can also come very 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.000
 well because if we are photographing from 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.230
 night a city usually the only 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.730
 environmental light that we have is what 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.480
 comes from street lamps that are usually 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.770
 insufficient 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.720
 then increasing the time of 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.790
 exhibition what we get is that the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.710
 sensor receives the light you need to 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.110
 be able to capture the photograph and also 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.910
 the lights of the cars that are going to be 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.950
 in motion, they are going to have that 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.390
 finished in the shape of a wake halo 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.580
 It is so nice and likes both 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.220
 many people 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.949
 a curiosity that surely if not what 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.580
 you know, it will draw your attention and it is that 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.740
 using exposure times 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.590
 prolonged it is possible to practice something 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.389
 which is very striking and that is being 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.620
 putting a lot of fashion in networks 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.229
 social to what is contributing 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.969
 internet and is the light painting light 20 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.039
 which means in English to paint with light 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.539
 the technique of light 21 the painting with 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.039
 light what allows us to use a 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.539
 Prolonged exposure time 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.409
 so that we can place ourselves in front 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.449
 of the camera 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.469
 holding our hand a flashlight or a 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.159
 led diode and move it in the air if 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.680
 we increase the exposure time 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:20.039
 for several seconds when we move 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.919
 our hand in the air with that flashlight 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.569
 or that light emitting device is going to 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.310
 remain the path that we make 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.659
 in the grass to remain embodied in the 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.310
 sensor of our camera with what 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.280
 when we see the photograph you will see 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.900
 a totally stable light path and 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.150
 fixed in the image that allows us 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.270
 really write in the air of a 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.189
 tangible form a final advice that 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.779
 we must be very aware if we use 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.729
 a very short exposure time a 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.259
 fraction of a second for example does 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.520
 we need to use a tripod because 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.169
 the sensor will be receiving light 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.150
 and little time with what although we have 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.650
 the camera held between our hands 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.479
 for example when we are photographing 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.520
 to a small child that exists that is 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.349
 scampering when he constantly goes to 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.970
 come out focused we use a fraction 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.530
 of second a very short time the camera 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.289
 the hands do not need the child's tripod 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.840
 will come completely still stopped in that 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.520
 instantly however if the time of 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.250
 exposure is prolonged for example 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.840
 resorting to the use scenario of which 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.159
 we talked before the waterfall where 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.960
 we want the water to look like this 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.849
 silky that forces us to use a 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.590
 exposure time of several seconds 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.750
 we necessarily need to use a 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.520
 tripod or if we do not have a tripod 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.740
 by hand you have to place the camera in a 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.690
 stable surface but never hold it 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.639
 between our hands because if not the 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.289
 let's move a kind of exposure of 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.639
 several seconds is a nobody gets 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.740
 have the camera completely still 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.460
 then there on stage there is always 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.460
 than to use a tripod
