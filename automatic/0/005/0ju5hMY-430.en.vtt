00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.189
 Hi guys all good 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 before anything else I want to ask for 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.740
 You nauseate my nails. 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.769
 how do you know i moved yet 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.230
 I could not do it and remove the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 remains of the enamel that was 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 in it because I did not buy the return 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.660
 but I asked on facebook if I could 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.340
 post this video not in poio nani all 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 world spoke video post because nobody 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.200
 Are you going to call everyone together then? 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.449
 I'm going to share with you one of the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 my biggest secrets is to get started 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.129
 the year with everything in the secret for you with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.469
 key and sharing a little 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.250
 of my knowledge as well as 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.870
 to draw an eye with flaccid skin 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 whenever I can take a picture on facebook 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.330
 everybody asks me how I 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.560
 I make that perfect outline of a skin 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 flaccid and we have secret there is a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 500 you will like 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.500
 the first thing is to analyze the eyes of the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 The person you're making is good and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.979
 important to know what this eye is 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 asking 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.320
 The second is to choose the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.430
 security material in the hand and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.979
 firmness and now yes comes the biggest tip that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 is to ask to be able to keep the eyes 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 open 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.149
 looking down and lifting the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.990
 eyebrow is to pull the look up well 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.409
 in the arch of the eyebrow pull the little screen 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.979
 I always like to start outlining the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.729
 internal to the external because it is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.479
 It's harder to get this little corner. 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.409
 right 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.200
 Then you're looking down. 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.580
 pulling skin up and start 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.350
 outlining dengue inside out and there 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.040
 in the corner to give that formal 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.040
 All pretty good. 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.190
 It's important to let you know that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.440
 outlined in the eye with flaccid skin it 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.440
 will always be a little bit thicker 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.450
 because the skin will fall off when you 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.940
 drop eyebrow so it's important 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.280
 you know if you make a sketch 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.240
 very thin it will get extra fine 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.240
 when you let go 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.980
 so it's important that when you already 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.980
 have a format so you do not know if you are 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.640
 very rough or not that you get to 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.670
 let go the skin ask for model look 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.280
 forward and analyze whether it is in the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.740
 good format or if it is too thin 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.200
 Can you see I pull it open? 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.170
 Your eyes and I always ask for the model. 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.250
 looking down is never close 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.770
 eyes because if it closes with certainty 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.230
 will shape your outline 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.440
 you can see that when the blade Linnaeus 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.940
 the inner part of the eyes I do to 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.550
 look down and into the opposite corner 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.280
 of which I'm delirious 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.080
 Why not scare her there? 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.660
 do not keep flashing the tear 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.870
 it is important to always take a Unchained 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:51.020
 not hurt your client, not to be able to 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.020
 rest your eyes and always analyzing 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:04.050
 now is the most important corner for 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.890
 lift the eye pulled on the mature eye 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.770
 it has to be a little bit before 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.830
 finish the eyelash line 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.320
 because if you do otherwise the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.590
 delegate will fall because the skin 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.780
 mature she has fallen like you are 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.910
 starting up 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.340
 It may be that on release it will go down 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.860
 nef along with the skin 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:45.360
 so it's always drawing by pulling 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:49.290
 releasing to analyze today what 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.720
 happens when you dna well well 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.720
 yields the end of the lash line 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.570
 You see, it falls. 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.430
 he gets tired he does not look well 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.430
 pulled it does not look up 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.190
 Then I started out drawing a 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.840
 bit out and then I go 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:22.340
 completing the pulling towards the conca 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.340
 cap and I 'm completing and delineating 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.420
 well I am 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.930
 I analyze and now I will complete 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.610
 the whole outline with us is to the 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.670
 little 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.710
 now I take it from the corner and amended it with 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.090
 the pull 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.160
 you can see that it forms 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.230
 practically a straight line 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.170
 but when we let it it informs 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.170
 which he outlined more rounded 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.600
 In this case you can see that I 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.180
 pull on both sides 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.550
 examining the skin but never with the 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:17.140
 model with eyes closed and now I'm going 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.860
 to give you the final touch-up that is already 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.860
 right in the corner 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.690
 You can see the nails are a shard. 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:33.010
 but please forgive me too when 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:35.500
 I loose it, it 's fine but in place. 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.100
 here I'm giving a final touch-up I 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.620
 I'm actually letting them equal 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.500
 outlined but you know delineated 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.260
 are brothers do not need to be genius is the 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.600
 more similar but do not need 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.050
 be the same because no one has a 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.060
 eye exactly the other and that is 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.100
 the end result is super easy i will 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.590
 pass a black pencil over pre 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.800
 and mark the water line to be fine 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.380
 my mother- in- law she was on the 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.450
 day then she did not pass the one we chose 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.880
 make no makeup because 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.400
 people would go out and buy some things and 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.050
 she prefers only the same denomination that already 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.050
 It's pretty dramatic. 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:30.949
 So it's this people, this is my secret. 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.079
 and if it's my tips 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.759
 It took me years to learn only what 

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:36.679
 I finally learned and I really wanted to 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.259
 share with you because nobody 

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:39.979
 shared with me and I took the 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.689
 learn 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.029
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:46.309
 You'll like it and we'll see where 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:48.999
