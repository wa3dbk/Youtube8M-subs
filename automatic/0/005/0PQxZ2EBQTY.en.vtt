00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
so like let's get into the bending so

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.929 
so like let's get into the bending so
when<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.439> once<00:02:26.980> you're<00:02:27.250> ranked<00:02:27.549> up<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.790> want

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
when you once you're ranked up you want

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.530 
when you once you're ranked up you want
to<00:02:28.000> go<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.299> war<00:02:29.040> bending

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
to go to war bending

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.839 
to go to war bending
so<00:02:30.599> after<00:02:30.750> you've<00:02:30.959> done<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:32.519> should

warped<00:02:35.159> Wilder<00:02:35.670> work<00:02:35.849> sponsee<00:02:36.450> get<00:02:36.810> back<00:02:37.049> to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
warped Wilder work sponsee get back to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.190 
warped Wilder work sponsee get back to
our<00:02:37.620> viewer<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.519> there<00:02:39.510> will<00:02:39.689> be<00:02:39.719> water<00:02:42.200> air

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
our viewer and there will be water air

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
our viewer and there will be water air
earth<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:45.530> fire<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:48.799> bet<00:02:49.799> probably<00:02:50.489> some<00:02:51.090> of

earth and fire so I bet probably some of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880 
earth and fire so I bet probably some of
you<00:02:51.269> are<00:02:51.480> probably<00:02:51.510> thinking<00:02:52.049> well<00:02:52.590> what<00:02:52.709> if<00:02:52.829> i

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you are probably thinking well what if i
