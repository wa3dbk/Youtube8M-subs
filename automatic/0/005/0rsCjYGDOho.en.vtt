00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
shape of the snorlax head now you want

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.469 
shape of the snorlax head now you want
to<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.490> indent<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> have

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
in the snorlax right so you just do page

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.069 
in the snorlax right so you just do page
for<00:01:38.970> shield<00:01:39.570> shield<00:01:40.439> change<00:01:41.310> color<00:01:43.159> voila

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079

pretty good so far already this one's
very<00:01:48.390> easy<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.079> mean<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.560> layers

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
very easy I mean it's just layers

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.109 
very easy I mean it's just layers
bilayers<00:01:51.049> our<00:01:52.049> mouth<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> old<00:01:53.100> fold<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
bilayers our mouth is the old fold that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.620 
bilayers our mouth is the old fold that
is<00:01:54.829> medium<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> regular<00:01:56.579> old<00:01:57.090> oil<00:01:57.390> medium

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
is medium not the regular old oil medium

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.319 
is medium not the regular old oil medium
oval<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.860> you're<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> put<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> right

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
