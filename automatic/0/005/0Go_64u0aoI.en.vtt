thing<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.860> player<00:00:24.860> dependent<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.610> game

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
thing a player dependent a game

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.670 
thing a player dependent a game
dependent<00:00:26.539> thing<00:00:26.750> I<00:00:26.960> think<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:27.440> should<00:00:27.530> be<00:00:27.650> a

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
dependent thing I think it should be a

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.660 
dependent thing I think it should be a
pot<00:00:28.010> size<00:00:28.310> depending<00:00:28.940> I<00:00:29.119> like<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.990> idea<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.680> can

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
pot size depending I like the idea I can

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.130 
pot size depending I like the idea I can
see<00:00:31.910> how<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.119> kind<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.480> shaking<00:00:32.840> his<00:00:32.930> head<00:00:33.079> I

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
see how it kind of shaking his head I

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.110 
see how it kind of shaking his head I
just<00:00:33.410> wonder<00:00:33.710> how<00:00:33.739> how<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.550> would<00:00:34.640> be<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:34.850> force

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
just wonder how how it would be in force

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.369 
just wonder how how it would be in force
does<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.420> mean<00:00:35.569> that<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.809> dealers<00:00:36.170> have<00:00:36.289> to

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
does that mean that the dealers have to

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.869 
does that mean that the dealers have to
keep<00:00:36.530> track<00:00:36.769> of<00:00:36.829> pot<00:00:37.190> sighs<00:00:37.429> I<00:00:37.460> think<00:00:37.670> that's

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
keep track of pot sighs I think that's

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.399 
keep track of pot sighs I think that's
the<00:00:37.969> issue<00:00:38.179> simple<00:00:38.780> I<00:00:38.839> mean<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.019> make<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.260> pot

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
the issue simple I mean you make the pot

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.380 
the issue simple I mean you make the pot
like<00:00:39.559> it<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.890> punch<00:00:40.100> in<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.489> pots<00:00:40.699> 3000<00:00:41.329> you

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
like it the punch in the pots 3000 you

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.759 
like it the punch in the pots 3000 you
can<00:00:41.510> do<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.719> your<00:00:41.899> boat's<00:00:42.050> 2,000<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.589> can<00:00:42.710> do

a lot of money from the show because

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.580 
a lot of money from the show because
basically<00:02:02.329> our<00:02:02.659> number<00:02:02.840> one<00:02:02.960> strategy<00:02:03.289> tip

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
basically our number one strategy tip

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.919 
basically our number one strategy tip
was<00:02:03.799> just<00:02:04.789> always<00:02:04.999> fast<00:02:05.329> play<00:02:05.539> everything

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
was just always fast play everything

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.719 
was just always fast play everything

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
because at that time people slow played

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.300 
because at that time people slow played
so<00:02:07.999> much<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.509> by<00:02:08.750> fast<00:02:09.110> playing<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:10.039> are

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
so much that by fast playing you are

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.130 
so much that by fast playing you are
actually<00:02:10.580> being<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.300> deceptive<00:02:11.660> than<00:02:11.840> by

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
actually being more deceptive than by

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.080 
actually being more deceptive than by
traffic<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.160> get<00:02:13.370> people<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.850> make

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
traffic and you get people to like make

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.850 
traffic and you get people to like make
moves<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.720> stuff<00:02:14.990> like<00:02:15.140> that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
they got confusing obviously is because

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.390 
they got confusing obviously is because

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
on the river and and he took the bait

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.000 
on the river and and he took the bait
good<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:28.970> her<00:02:29.590> recognizing<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:30.920> she

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
good for her recognizing that and she

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.430
