00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.009
 hello to the viewers of my channel and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.810
 just spectators motorists here came 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:24.000
 such a tape recorder and the owner asked 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:27.300
 connect here the 1st channel to the sub woofer 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.119
 that is, we see us pin and here we are on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.189
 and output dynamics 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.120
 parenting accessories 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.250
 fuse and that's all like that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.800
 must be done in order to connect 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.800
 receiver to this head amplifier was 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 Of course we have the option to connect to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.680
 speaker output either directly or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.410
 through and on resistance 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.810
 but I think it will be better when here 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.110
 get to try 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.870
 and I have removed the cap top it 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.990
 It is very easy to shoot here 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.720
 there is 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.830
 scars and she just inserted from above 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 pick up gray is his hand 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.780
 gradually then these holders in general 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.910
 we are shooting and then we'll see what 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.790
 there we have more I think it we already 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:28.890
 the amplifier here it is here and it is not 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.960
 only we have chery m11 removed the radiator from 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.200
 transistors and starred 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.260
 radiators with chips here in general have 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.720
 us microcircuit to 7385 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.150
 and I think that to connect all the same 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.240
 individual russia just need to find by 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.060
 datashitu move on this chip solder 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.760
 wire and pull it off the body course and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.750
 then put inside plans 35 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.750
 continue here
