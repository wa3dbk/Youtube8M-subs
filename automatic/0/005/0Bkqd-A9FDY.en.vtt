00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
thought the yellow is just a little too

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.639

fine<00:01:47.600> linen<00:01:47.899> card<00:01:48.139> stack<00:01:48.409> because<00:01:49.189> I<00:01:49.369> think

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
fine linen card stack because I think

trick that i do to keep things looking
evenly<00:02:07.130> spaced<00:02:07.609> is<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.090> start<00:02:08.390> stamping<00:02:08.690> from

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
evenly spaced is to start stamping from

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.840 
evenly spaced is to start stamping from
the<00:02:09.140> center<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:09.770> start<00:02:10.100> in<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> center<00:02:10.520> and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
the center so start in the center and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.150 
the center so start in the center and
then<00:02:11.300> build<00:02:11.630> out<00:02:11.930> from<00:02:12.230> each<00:02:12.440> side<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.040> you're

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
then build out from each side and you're

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.930 
then build out from each side and you're
going<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.340> have<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> better<00:02:13.900> spaced<00:02:15.940> border

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
I'm rounding the corners there was a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.530 
I'm rounding the corners there was a
stamp<00:02:29.570> stitch<00:02:29.990> element<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.190> background

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
stamp stitch element on the background

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.510 
stamp stitch element on the background
of<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.840> original<00:02:33.200> card<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.890> enchanted

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
of the original card in enchanted

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.310 
of the original card in enchanted
evening<00:02:34.880> ink<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.360> chose<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.750> actually<00:02:36.110> do

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
evening ink and I chose to actually do

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.050 
evening ink and I chose to actually do
the<00:02:36.530> stitching<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.070> my<00:02:37.250> sewing<00:02:37.460> machine<00:02:37.580> you

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
the stitching with my sewing machine you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.940 
the stitching with my sewing machine you
could<00:02:39.340> definitely<00:02:40.340> stamp<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.270> with<00:02:41.950> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
could definitely stamp that with the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.180 
could definitely stamp that with the
stamping<00:02:43.430> stiched<00:02:44.300> line<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:45.020> would<00:02:45.860> keep<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
stamping stiched line I would keep the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.070 
stamping stiched line I would keep the
color<00:02:46.430> neutral<00:02:46.730> again<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:47.750> something

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
color neutral again it's something

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.330 
color neutral again it's something
that's<00:02:48.230> more<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.620> background<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that's more in the background of the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.120 
that's more in the background of the
card<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.180> would<00:02:50.360> instead<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.320> having<00:02:51.950> it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
card and so I would instead of having it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.800 
card and so I would instead of having it
compete<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> main<00:02:53.060> elements<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
compete with the main elements of the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.730 
compete with the main elements of the
card<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:55.040> let<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.400> stay<00:02:56.209> neutral<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.900> added<00:02:57.560> a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
card just let it stay neutral I added a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.970 
card just let it stay neutral I added a
little<00:02:57.770> red<00:02:58.490> heart<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.709> inside<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
little red heart in the inside of the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.190 
little red heart in the inside of the
heart<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.340> felt<00:03:01.550> like<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.360> definitely<00:03:02.989> needed

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
heart I felt like it definitely needed

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.410 
heart I felt like it definitely needed
something<00:03:03.739> kind<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:03.950> inside<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.180> heart<00:03:05.360> to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
something kind of inside of the heart to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.510 
something kind of inside of the heart to
fill<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:05.959> there<00:03:06.650> was<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.800> bigger<00:03:07.100> heart<00:03:07.400> on

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
fill that in there was a bigger heart on

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.250 
fill that in there was a bigger heart on
the<00:03:07.640> other<00:03:07.850> side<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.420> strip<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.140> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the other side of the strip on the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.600 
the other side of the strip on the
original<00:03:09.620> card<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.040> thought<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.310> was<00:03:10.400> just

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
original card and I thought it was just

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.250 
original card and I thought it was just
too<00:03:10.880> big<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.239> maybe<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.660> one<00:03:12.050> too<00:03:12.230> many

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
too big and maybe just one too many

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.130 
too big and maybe just one too many
things<00:03:12.500> going<00:03:12.830> on<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.520> strip<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.870> this

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
things going on on that strip so this

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.660 
things going on on that strip so this
simplifies<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.680> little<00:03:16.070> bit<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.400> kind<00:03:16.550> of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
simplifies a little bit and kind of

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.050 
simplifies a little bit and kind of
accents<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.540> second<00:03:17.900> part<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> sentiment

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
accents the second part of the sentiment

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.820 
accents the second part of the sentiment
