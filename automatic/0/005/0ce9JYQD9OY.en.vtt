so<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.750> start<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.289> off<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.279> after

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so we start the game off here I go after

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.540 
so we start the game off here I go after
wah-wah-whoo<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.469> hacked<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.280> couple

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
wah-wah-whoo you know hacked a couple

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.840 
wah-wah-whoo you know hacked a couple
times<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.149> accorded<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:37.129> twice<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.550> then

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
times and I accorded them twice and then

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.430 
times and I accorded them twice and then
we<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.239> team<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.899> underneath<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
we have this team of two underneath the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.410 
we have this team of two underneath the
tree<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.070> don't<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.430> any<00:00:41.790> swords<00:00:42.239> yet

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
tree that they don't have any swords yet

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
tree that they don't have any swords yet
so<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.290> an<00:00:43.829> issue<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.309> kill<00:00:44.489> them

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so it's not really an issue to kill them

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
so it's not really an issue to kill them

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
expecting it then we get tree line who

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.189 
expecting it then we get tree line who
kills<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> pig<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> berserker<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.660> still

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
though they had strength to block

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.429 
though they had strength to block
hitting<00:01:06.000> definitely<00:01:06.479> made<00:01:06.630> their<00:01:06.810> shots<00:01:07.110> less

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.870 
cannibal and for some reason he made
boots<00:02:34.470> first<00:02:34.740> even<00:02:35.190> though<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.400> had<00:02:35.610> enough

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
boots first even though we had enough

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.820 
boots first even though we had enough
for<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.120> chest<00:02:36.390> plate<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.900> definitely<00:02:37.620> would

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
for a chest plate I definitely would

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
for a chest plate I definitely would
recommend<00:02:37.860> making<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.730> chestplate<00:02:39.120> first<00:02:39.540> then

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
recommend making a chestplate first then

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.810 
recommend making a chestplate first then
leggings<00:02:40.350> then<00:02:40.620> boots<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.489> helmet

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
leggings then boots then the helmet

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.280 
leggings then boots then the helmet
because<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> chest<00:02:42.690> plates<00:02:42.959> going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.140> help

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
because the chest plates going to help

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.949 
because the chest plates going to help
you<00:02:43.380> want<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> lot<00:02:43.770> more<00:02:43.800> than<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.250> boots<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
you want a lot more than just boots so I

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.930 
you want a lot more than just boots so I
go<00:02:46.230> through<00:02:46.470> all<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> his<00:02:46.830> stuff<00:02:47.070> because<00:02:47.790> he

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
damage transfers through the roof and it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.940 
damage transfers through the roof and it
actually<00:03:42.030> kills<00:03:42.540> him<00:03:42.810> which<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.739> first
