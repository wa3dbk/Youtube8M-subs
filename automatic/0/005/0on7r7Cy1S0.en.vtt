00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
weeks long I'd be very very surprised if

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
weeks long I'd be very very surprised if
it<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:06.119> than<00:01:06.270> two<00:01:06.420> weeks<00:01:06.540> long<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.960> then

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.679 
it was more than two weeks long and then
I<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.650> assume<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.640> soon<00:01:09.060> after<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
I would assume that very soon after the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
I would assume that very soon after the
PlayStation<00:01:10.290> 1<00:01:10.320> ends<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
PlayStation 1 ends is when it's going to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.090 
PlayStation 1 ends is when it's going to
come<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.090> xbox<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> pc<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.740> honestly

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
come out on xbox and pc and honestly

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
come out on xbox and pc and honestly
like<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> cool<00:01:15.750> because

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
like I think that's kind of cool because

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
like I think that's kind of cool because

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
beta what can we expect I'm just you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.039 
beta what can we expect I'm just you
know<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> guessing<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.810> would

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
know kind of guessing here but I would

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
know kind of guessing here but I would
assume<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:35.280> similar<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
assume that would be very similar to the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
assume that would be very similar to the
build<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> game<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.930> we're<00:01:37.200> playing<00:01:37.350> now
