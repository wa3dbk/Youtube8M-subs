00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.909
 I noticed that a little poop 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.649
 he knew all this 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.520

 what is here 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.449
 the principle when he left 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.159

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.199
 so why the 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.199
 that's what the open source ladies singles did 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.830
 test here
