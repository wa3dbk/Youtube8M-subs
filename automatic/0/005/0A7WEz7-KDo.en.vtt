00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:03.509 
hi my name is Dean stoica and this is

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.450 
hi my name is Dean stoica and this is
heater<00:00:03.689> works<00:00:04.609> come<00:00:05.609> on<00:00:05.669> back<00:00:06.830> well<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.160> is

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
heater works come on back well this is

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.110 
heater works come on back well this is
the<00:00:09.240> inside<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> our<00:00:10.890> hotspur<00:00:11.610> bushing<00:00:11.940> and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
the inside of our hotspur bushing and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.270 
the inside of our hotspur bushing and
actually<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.080> inside<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.410> pretty<00:00:13.800> much<00:00:13.830> all

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
actually the inside of pretty much all

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.999 
actually the inside of pretty much all
our<00:00:14.610> hot<00:00:14.940> runner<00:00:15.120> bushings<00:00:15.800> we're<00:00:16.800> really

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:17.009 
our hot runner bushings we're really

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.849 
our hot runner bushings we're really
fanatical<00:00:17.400> about<00:00:17.939> re<00:00:18.599> profiles<00:00:19.259> one<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.769> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
fanatical about re profiles one of the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.970 
fanatical about re profiles one of the
things<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.460> try<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.060> maximize<00:00:21.599> is<00:00:21.980> if

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
things we really try and maximize is if

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.409 
things we really try and maximize is if
a<00:00:23.160> customer<00:00:23.519> says<00:00:23.730> he<00:00:23.849> wants<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> run<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
a customer says he wants to run a

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.290 
a customer says he wants to run a
bushing<00:00:24.839> in<00:00:24.929> 500<00:00:25.439> degrees<00:00:25.849> we<00:00:26.849> make<00:00:27.029> sure<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
bushing in 500 degrees we make sure that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.859 
bushing in 500 degrees we make sure that
it's<00:00:27.599> 500<00:00:28.140> degrees<00:00:29.300> along<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.509> whole<00:00:30.630> thing

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it's 500 degrees along the whole thing

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.620 
it's 500 degrees along the whole thing
well<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.499> do<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:31.980> designing<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.450> right

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
well we do it by designing in the right

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
well we do it by designing in the right
heat<00:00:33.870> profile<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.530> wind<00:00:35.120> resistance<00:00:36.120> wire<00:00:36.330> on

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
heat profile we wind resistance wire on

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.310 
heat profile we wind resistance wire on
the<00:00:37.170> core<00:00:37.460> according<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.640> our<00:00:38.730> specific

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
the core according to our specific

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.630 
the core according to our specific
calculations<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.560> just<00:00:40.680> maximize<00:00:41.220> it<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
calculations but we just maximize it I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400 
calculations but we just maximize it I
have<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.970> lot<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.150> confidence<00:00:42.600> walking<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.320> a

sometimes<00:00:46.290> I<00:00:46.410> feel<00:00:46.560> like<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.920> carrying<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
sometimes I feel like it's carrying a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.820 
sometimes I feel like it's carrying a
gun<00:00:48.120> into<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.510> butter<00:00:48.750> knife<00:00:48.810> fight<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.650> not

product<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.870> guess<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.200> could<00:00:52.230> say<00:00:52.560> it<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.950> but

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
product I guess you could say it is but

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
product I guess you could say it is but
it<00:00:53.280> isn't<00:00:53.430> there's<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> lot<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> craftsmanship

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

bring to making hot runner systems and
not<00:01:25.770> runner<00:01:25.979> bushings<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:27.030> can't<00:01:27.299> survive<00:01:28.140> in

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
not runner bushings you can't survive in

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.980 
not runner bushings you can't survive in
either<00:01:29.219> industry<00:01:29.759> without<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.479> those<00:01:30.630> things

either industry without all those things

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
either industry without all those things
that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.770> bring<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.219> our<00:01:32.429> products

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that's what we bring to our products

here<00:01:33.109> I'm<00:01:34.109> a<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:34.409> competitive<00:01:34.560> guy<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
here I'm a pretty competitive guy and I

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.629 
here I'm a pretty competitive guy and I
believe<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.960> there's<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:38.009> no<00:01:38.249> point<00:01:38.490> in

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
believe that there's really no point in

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:39.919 
believe that there's really no point in
doing<00:01:38.819> anything<00:01:39.030> unless<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.749> to<00:01:39.840> do

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
doing anything unless you're going to do

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.889 
doing anything unless you're going to do
it<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.069> it<00:01:41.249> right<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.899> heater

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it right so I do it right here heater

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.779 
it right so I do it right here heater
works<00:01:43.200> what's<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> heat<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.639> right

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
works what's the heat in the right

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.060 
works what's the heat in the right
places
