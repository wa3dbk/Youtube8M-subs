 Good afternoon from the golán I love being like 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.100
 you can install a 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.919
 a playstation 3 control 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.559
 to a system 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.049
 delphi spirit 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.769
 the first thing you have to do 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.769

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.410
 Now what you have to do is 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.990
 they tell you to register 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.670
 a command system or 15 advocated 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.050

 but they can close mines 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.100
 most common I can not with a hand propose 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 it can be a fifth 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.059
 Well, I do not know where 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.089

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.089
 along with those who do them if a little bit 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.809
 as a speaker in the sun 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.779
 3 times between his usual subjects without goals 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.929

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.459

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.769
