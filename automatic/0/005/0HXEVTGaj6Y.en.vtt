00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.850
 I have not talked to the camera for a long time 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.149
 feels very weird 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.940
 so that today you are going to make a 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.530
 really good salmon salad and this is 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.530
 because today Mexico plays 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.250
 out out the capital that by the time 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.320
 up this video game already have 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.710
 gone but hopefully they win I hope 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.710
 who have won 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.140
 this is what I 'm going to do today is that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.910
 all my friends got together that for 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
 watch the game and then all that go 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.480
 to ask for pizza that sushi that this 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.250
 that and I really want to eat 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.780
 healthy but at the same time not 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.750
 I want to lose the game and with 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.550
 my friends are going to say what exaggerated by 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.170
 bring my own food to a place where 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.519
 she's going to see food and like that but the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.589
 truth is that I am in confidence with my 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.449
 friends in these cases that is like more than 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.159
 trust and more willax that can carry 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.629
 I eat my own food because I take advantage of 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.370
 take it in salads that the truth 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.900
 is just as rich as a pizza or that 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.089
 a sushi or that whatever they go to 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.739
 eat them this you do not have to do 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.239
 to go see a game you can do it 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 for the loncho the bets and even 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.890
 for your house and then I'm going to teach you 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.420
 how I did it the truth is that I have left 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.930
 very good has already done several times and 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.930
 I love 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.040
 this yes I hope you like it as you want 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.299
 see that you get used to this from 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.710
 speak alone to the camera 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.929
 but I hope you like it a lot 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.020
 video the truth is that it is delicious and 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.329
 Super healthy super nutritious and let's go 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 to start the ingredients that we are going to 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.149
 need are very well washed spinach 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.340
 half pear half avocado half 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.030
 medium carrot cucumber and a tomato 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.310
 whole and little panela this too 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.349
 we are going to need salmon but if not 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 you have or you do not like you can use tuna 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.420
 can or chick as well as chicken breast 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
 cooked and shredded in fact any 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.020
 of the ingredients can replace them 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.060
 then we are going to grab our pan and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.619
 let's put a little oil and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.239
 we let it get really hot very well 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.000
 before putting the fish because if not 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.619
 we are going to disrupt this when it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.659
 start cooking the fish we're going to 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.539
 put a little pepper and little 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.060
 grain salt and ready to spice it 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.379
 let's leave here to cook and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.620
 let's start applying all the 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.200
 other ingredients 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.450
 for the cucumber I like to leave the skin 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.610
 and there's absolutely nothing problem with 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.140
 that the Alavés super good and rivals' the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 slices super super thin and this 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.099
 as you can see after slicing what 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.870
 super thin I cut it in half and I 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.150
 It took a bit of work to record and cut 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 but that's why it came out so weird but if and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.349
 now the tomato is going to use everything 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.480
 completito and is if I like this 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.060
 cut it into large slices and 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.519
 thick but you want to be super 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.340
 personal this and also part in 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.200
 slices and then I break it in half and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.150
 let's do exactly the same with 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.040
 the pear the pear to me it makes me a 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.319
 super essential ingredient but if you do not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.970
 you can put him apple because 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.829
 they do the same thing basically they add 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.870
 as a crunch or as a durito to the 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.120
 salad and add a little bit like 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.430
 sweet and everything tastes great and also 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.319
 sliced ​​them into the slices more 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.359
 delgaditas I can with a lot 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.700
 Be careful not to cut and again 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.140
 there, like I had a hard time cutting it 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.690
 while I record 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.120
 again let's grate half carrot 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.600
 this you can use more or less like 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.060
 you want and also this two slices of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.310
 panela that later I will cut in 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.630
 cubes and all these ingredients are 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.209
 the ones that I put but you can 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.980
 change it replace what you want if 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.540
 you do not like it that way if you like it you want it 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.319
 put more than you want to put less your 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.499
 vélez is you super personal 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.569
 and then if once we are biting and 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:50.310
 all this do not forget to be checking 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.400
 the fish that is not going to burn 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.560
 how can you see here how did he put 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.239
 the cap all the steam and so is it 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.249
 cooking but to brown a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.370
 we're going to flip it of all the 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:03.930
 sides of one side of the other and head and 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.760
 when our fish is ready, what 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.060
 let's put on a plate and before that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.669
 it gets cold I crumble it very much indeed 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.799
 you almost do them and what 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.480
 crumble with a fork to leave it 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.789
 let it cool and then add it to 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.220
 salad and do not forget that there 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.229
 is the skin of the salmon then it 's like that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.110
 you have to take it off because personally 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.630
 I do not know how there are people who do but 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.610
 me not that it's like and well now in a 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.880
 bowl the simplest thing in the world we're going to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.060
 stir all the ingredients there goes 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.240
 the cucumber the tomato the pear the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.460
 panela grated the panela and then I 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.919
 I took an avocado I split it in half what 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.289
 I started in small squares and then that's what 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.389
 I also put the bowl and this also helps 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.770
 how to season a little because it gives you 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.470
 creaminess and so 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.590
 the salad and of course we finished 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.389
 with the salmon that is already fried and 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.520
 ready and I 'm going to put this dressing 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.470
 which is my favorite dressing half but you 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.300
 you can put the one you want or if 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.069
 you want to really make it very light 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.500
 you can put lemon juice and with that 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.389
 you also look great and ready 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.879
 after this, we already revolve it 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.280
 and I put it in a tupper that is half 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:18.360
 Ugly but then I did not have anything else if I 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.039
 I needed to carry and well nothing this was 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.020

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.610

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.949

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.830
