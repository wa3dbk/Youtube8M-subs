00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hello everyone, it was cancer and today I want 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.970
 tell you about build torn wounds for 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.429
 barbarian 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.340
 this build used to be called double 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.310
 tornado but after such 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.380
 thing like the power of monsters need to scream at 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.340
 resists simply ceased 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.800
 exist 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.619
 perhaps only in the budget version she 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 stayed and he came to replace such 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.390
 wonderful thing like lacerated wounds 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 which in this case raises very 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 good damage and survival 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.610
 Well now the traditionally consider 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 sides of this build 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.410
 and let's start with the benefits of 1 plus which 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.620
 I would like to note that this is what 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.450
 build gorgeous damage 2 plus this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.969
 that this build is very good 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.760
 survival and 3 plus lies 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.190
 Perhaps the fact that the build is very 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.280
 movable and therefore very well suited 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 for farm shook that build is still good 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 that he only has nothing on my 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.789
 look one minus and minus this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.229
 is that this build is not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 is a budget 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.400
 which means you will need a lot 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 investing this build in order 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.689
 so that it functions on all 100 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.799
 percent 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.350
 Having considered this build from all sides 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.320
 move on to considering equipment and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.659
 skills and so in order for us to create 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 this build we need to go to the menu 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.210
 either press the escape button then go 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 in the settings in the game in line 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 free to assign mini 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.770
 tick click apply and ready so what 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.900
 Well consider our equipment and the first 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.000
 what I would like to say is that in 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.610
 the immortal king's set in this 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.130
 case fits best he raises 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 us survival and is not very 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 expensive option for this build 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 I would like to say a few more words about the belt 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 the immortal king he gives 3 percent 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.549
 health kidnapping that's very good 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.369
 makes life easier for us because in this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.560
 case my contempt goes without 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.930
 health kidnapping so this is already 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.360
 good bonus to the fact that we will be better 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.459
 to survive a weapon would take scorn 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.350
 because it is the best cheap 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.900
 option by which 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.790
 on raise damage to this build 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.040
 worked productively we will need 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.200
 critical strike chance should 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.350
 be at least 40 percent for 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.230
 In order to recover the rage well 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.990
 after reviewing the equipment, let's move on to 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.210
 skill on the left mouse button I put 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.970
 yourself crushing blow string onslaught 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.140
 in order to restore a little bit 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.630
 more rage 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.390
 also here comes rabies rabies 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.600
 crazy right mouse button i 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.780
 put yourself to the foundation of this build whirlwind and 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.900
 then the runes come up next or hurricane 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.060
 either a volcanic eruption or wind cut 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.790
 in order to restore a little bit 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.950
 furious at one and set myself that 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.920
 skill with which we will wear 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.710
 just hell damage and runes fit here 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.340
 following either bloodlust for 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.710
 health recovery 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.560
 either rubbing for additional 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.230
 damage sprint string with wind speed 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.900
 allow us to make this build much 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.090
 more energetic and add us a little bit 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.700
 damage due to those breeze who 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.040
 will arise behind our back in combat 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.780
 rage with a rune in the thick of it will allow 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.520
 we recover very large 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.200
 the amount of rage that is us 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.560
 need to maintain 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.890
 our berserk with a rune eternal chaos and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.020
 it means extra damage and 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.040
 immunity control consider 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.780
 passive skill 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.750
 and let's start with mastery 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 arms in this case he raises us 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.260
 ten percent chance 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.990
 critical strike second passive 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.820
 this frenzy skill raises us 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.550
 critical strike chance by 5 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.910
 percent and critical damage by 50 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.690
 finally the third passive skill is 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.640
 bloodthirstiness will allow us 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.790
 restore health in volume 3 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.930
 percent of damage dealt budget 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.120
 version of this build 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.590
 or the old version which was called 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.480
 just double tornado 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.070
 included such a thing as 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.410
 war cry with rune 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.540
 impunity strictly speaking this and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.820
 there is the very main difference that I 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.770
 today I would like to make out that 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.479
