00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 chapter 48 I heard about this jacob house that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.639
 you call yourselves the name of israel those who 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.650
 They came out of the waters of Judah who 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 they swear in the name of jehovah and they do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.690
 memory of the god of israel more not in 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.820
 truth or justice because of the saint 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.130
 city â€‹â€‹are named and in the god of israel 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.000
 they trust his name is jehovah of the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.670
 armies what happened before I said it and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.939
 I published it from my mouth 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.040
 and soon it was actually because I know 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 that you are hard and iron rod 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.600
 service and your bronze front that what 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 I said long ago before it happened 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 I warned you not to tell me 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.309
 idol did my sculpture images 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.800
 and definition they sent these things what 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.410
 you heard and you saw everything and I will not announce it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.829
 jce you now, well, in fact, hear 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.449
 new and hidden things that you did not know 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.670
 now they have been created not in days 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.160
 past or before this day you had 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.250
 heard so that you do not say here that I 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.750
 I knew if you had never heard it or never 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 you had known him 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 it certainly did not open your ear before 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 I knew that being disloyal had to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.439
 disobey so have me rebel 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.780
 from the belly for the love of my name 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.069

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.770

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.200
 Chaldeans, I talked and I called him and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.840

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.660

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.070
