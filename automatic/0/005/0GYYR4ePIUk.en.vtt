 about the new lights you buy but 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.929
 everyone saw that face too 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.410
 unsatisfied that I had and that's why it's 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.449
 that I bought these new lights a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 soft box and here I will show you the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.590
 unboxing quickie guys this is all 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.500
 that brings brings 8 lights and two stents that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.670
 are the stand for the lights and two 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 stents that are the stand for the curtain 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.030
 Green guy makes me have no chroma 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.040
 also and I'm going to talk to you a little 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 later on so that you are 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.200
 watching sadly trying to adjust 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.390
 that and really, I had to look 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.829
 an online tutorial I'm going to leave here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120
 down how to do it I did not make a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.010
 tutorial because this channel is not a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.610
 tutorial of lights but the truth is that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 finally thanks to this tutorial I managed 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.730
 put it though it was very well difficult a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.530
 once I was adjusted I searched to put 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.519
 the lights there are watching how you 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
 I put the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.409
 you translate that it was not easy to put it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.860
 and ready to try the lights 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.259
 know how they turn on how they can see the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.000
 lights if they work guys and then I came 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.130
 and I put this to you what it is for to do 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.110
 that the lights you like a little more 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 soft and according to a little more natural to the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.250
 same time that you can see now 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.030
 when it turns on but I'm going to do the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.890
 others and it's like they're two I did not show the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.049
 same procedure but finish them 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.060
 now I am tactically putting what 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.789
 It will be the curtain where I will 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.989
 put the green curtain these manuals the 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.459
 truth is that you see that I am 

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:45.329
 reading in a little bit for the truth is 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:48.149
 that are useless and how can they 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.849
 see I'm almost finished with 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.959
 adjust it a bit difficult but all 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.679
 you can realize all the 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.270
 movements that I do to achieve those 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.310
 guys while I finish adjusting 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.600
 lights so that they see it with the chroma 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 I want to say about this page that I made 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 in amazon associated with hamas are in 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.150

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.160

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.120

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.880
 currently using but it's a version 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.430
 more modern that I recommend super 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.580
