00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
a bait sinks through the water column

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.910 
a bait sinks through the water column
and<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:39.329> very<00:00:39.570> important<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> understand<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and it's very important to understand it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.490 
and it's very important to understand it
because<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.059> way<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.170> sort<00:00:43.440> of

there are some but for the most part
most<00:00:51.120> baits<00:00:51.510> work<00:00:51.899> pretty<00:00:52.320> well<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
most baits work pretty well if you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.459 
most baits work pretty well if you
understand<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.300> they're<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.289> them

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
understanding of rates of fall how they

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
understanding of rates of fall how they
work<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> different<00:01:00.840> rates<00:01:01.020> are

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
work and what the different rates are

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
work and what the different rates are
for<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:02.280> help<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.820> buy<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.449> baits

Huddleston because there who originated
the<00:01:11.520> idea<00:01:11.780> they<00:01:12.780> come<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:14.010> rates<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.640> fall

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the idea they come in for rates of fall

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.959 
system is based on and ro f5 will sink 5
feet<00:01:55.229> every<00:01:56.159> 10<00:01:56.430> seconds<00:01:57.119> an<00:01:57.329> ro<00:01:57.960> F<00:01:58.170> 12<00:01:58.640> 12<00:01:59.640> feet

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
feet every 10 seconds an ro F 12 12 feet

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.830 
feet every 10 seconds an ro F 12 12 feet
every<00:02:00.450> 10<00:02:00.689> seconds<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> 16<00:02:02.840> 16

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
every 10 seconds and so on the 16 16

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.950 
every 10 seconds and so on the 16 16
feet<00:02:04.200> every<00:02:04.710> 10<00:02:04.979> seconds<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.630> how<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
feet every 10 seconds so that's how that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.219 
feet every 10 seconds so that's how that
works<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.060> according<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> can

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
lead in it it's heavier so it's going to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.170

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
bit better and rof 5 will tend to just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.350 
bit better and rof 5 will tend to just
sort<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.160> bump<00:03:05.400> its<00:03:05.610> way<00:03:05.760> along<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.240> not

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
sort of bump its way along and not

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.110 
sort of bump its way along and not
really<00:03:06.630> stick<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.650> rocks<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.700> depending

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
really stick in the rocks so depending

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.080 
really stick in the rocks so depending
on<00:03:09.209> how<00:03:09.980> how<00:03:10.980> tough<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.610> cover<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.060> you're

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
on how how tough the cover is you're

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.270 
on how how tough the cover is you're
fishing<00:03:12.720> around<00:03:13.050> fishing<00:03:13.770> one<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.190> the

fishing around fishing one of the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.040 
fishing around fishing one of the
lighter<00:03:14.520> baits<00:03:14.850> might<00:03:15.300> be<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> better<00:03:15.780> option

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
lighter baits might be a better option

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.100 
lighter baits might be a better option
even<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:17.190> deeper<00:03:17.610> water<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.360> takes<00:03:18.720> more

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
even in deeper water it just takes more

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.020 
even in deeper water it just takes more
patience<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.980> wait<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.580> get<00:03:20.820> down

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
patience to wait for it to get down

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.880 
patience to wait for it to get down
there<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.810> hopefully<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.320> helps<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.800> little

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
there so hopefully that helps a little

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.880 
there so hopefully that helps a little

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
getting a little bit tricky is when you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.910 
getting a little bit tricky is when you
get<00:04:08.519> into<00:04:08.820> some<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:10.290> different

the cheap reproduction even with these

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.379 
the cheap reproduction even with these
there's<00:04:25.830> nothing

one this is a taro f12 is it sinks in
the<00:04:44.060> water<00:04:44.270> column<00:04:44.569> it's<00:04:44.870> actually<00:04:45.199> going<00:04:45.349> to

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
the water column it's actually going to

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.550 
the water column it's actually going to
swim<00:04:45.919> down<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.729> look<00:04:47.449> really<00:04:47.659> good<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.289> one

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
swim down and look really good this one

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.469 
swim down and look really good this one
is<00:04:49.039> gonna<00:04:49.219> flop<00:04:49.610> onto<00:04:49.939> its<00:04:50.090> side<00:04:50.240> there's

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
is gonna flop onto its side there's

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.999 
is gonna flop onto its side there's
nothing<00:04:50.840> in<00:04:50.990> here<00:04:51.169> but<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.349> bunch<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.710> lead

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
nothing in here but a bunch of lead

there's<00:04:52.610> no<00:04:52.819> foam<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.330> balance<00:04:53.689> the<00:04:53.840> bait<00:04:54.020> it's

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
there's no foam to balance the bait it's

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.260 
there's no foam to balance the bait it's
gonna<00:04:54.680> just<00:04:54.949> shoot<00:04:55.189> to<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.550> bottom<00:04:55.909> on<00:04:56.090> its

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
gonna just shoot to the bottom on its

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.600 
gonna just shoot to the bottom on its
side<00:04:56.509> it's<00:04:56.749> probably<00:04:57.319> an<00:04:57.469> RAF<00:04:57.979> if<00:04:58.249> I<00:04:58.400> had<00:04:58.520> to

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
side it's probably an RAF if I had to

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.200 
side it's probably an RAF if I had to
guess<00:04:58.819> 25<00:04:59.539> plus<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.860> mean<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.460> sinks<00:05:01.819> really

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
guess 25 plus I mean it sinks really

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.119 
guess 25 plus I mean it sinks really
fast<00:05:02.509> when<00:05:03.199> it<00:05:03.289> hits<00:05:03.469> the<00:05:03.620> bottom<00:05:03.889> it's<00:05:04.009> gonna

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
fast when it hits the bottom it's gonna

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.490 
fast when it hits the bottom it's gonna
lay<00:05:04.340> on<00:05:04.370> its<00:05:04.610> side<00:05:04.729> because<00:05:05.659> it's<00:05:05.810> unbalanced

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
lay on its side because it's unbalanced

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.469 
lay on its side because it's unbalanced
whereas<00:05:07.159> a<00:05:07.189> Huddleston<00:05:07.789> will<00:05:07.909> hit<00:05:08.029> the<00:05:08.180> bottom

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
whereas a Huddleston will hit the bottom

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.950 
whereas a Huddleston will hit the bottom
and<00:05:08.569> sit<00:05:09.139> flat<00:05:09.560> just<00:05:10.400> like<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.699> bait<00:05:11.090> Smith<00:05:11.569> or
