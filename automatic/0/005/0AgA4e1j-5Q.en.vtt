II<00:01:48.000> must<00:01:48.360> sin<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.520> M<00:01:50.939> part<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
II must sin so this as M part is the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.490 
II must sin so this as M part is the
denial<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.460> also<00:01:54.439> there's<00:01:55.579> we<00:01:56.579> only<00:01:56.880> use<00:01:57.210> the
