the key to table tennis I might have to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.130 
the key to table tennis I might have to
say<00:01:35.729> using<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.270> training<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.659> effectively

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
as I'm that's how you don't have enough

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.050 
as I'm that's how you don't have enough
of<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:40.310> noticed<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.520> starting<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
of them noticed I'm starting from the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.010 
of them noticed I'm starting from the
hip<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:43.110> giving<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.380> real<00:01:43.740> side<00:01:44.130> spin

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
hip you're giving that real side spin

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
hip you're giving that real side spin
I'm<00:01:46.020> also<00:01:46.200> him<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> ball<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> edge<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.490> my

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I'm also him the ball on the edge of my

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.899 
I'm also him the ball on the edge of my
back<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.869> gives<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.290> speed<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:50.189> been

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
back which gives it a speed that's been

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.069 
back which gives it a speed that's been
required<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> I'm<00:01:53.909> finishing<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.600> or

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
required and I'm finishing in or

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
required and I'm finishing in or
backhand<00:01:55.350> position<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> stroke<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> really

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
backhand position the stroke is a really

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.030 
backhand position the stroke is a really
effective<00:01:56.969> way<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.570> returning<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.350> short<00:01:58.770> serve

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
effective way of returning a short serve

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:16.330 
effective way of returning a short serve
or<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.399> short<00:01:59.969> push

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.770 

so<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:17.790> you're<00:02:17.940> playing<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.360> stroke<00:02:18.630> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
so when you're playing this stroke you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.449 
so when you're playing this stroke you
need<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.200> about<00:02:19.319> how<00:02:19.709> much<00:02:19.860> backspin

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
need to think about how much backspin

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.760 
need to think about how much backspin
your<00:02:20.819> opponent's<00:02:21.300> put<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> ball<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.110> they

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
your opponent's put on the ball if they

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.070 
your opponent's put on the ball if they
put<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> lot<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.340> backspin<00:02:23.940> your<00:02:24.569> stroke<00:02:24.840> needs

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
put a lot of backspin your stroke needs

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.199 
put a lot of backspin your stroke needs
to<00:02:25.200> be<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.350> little<00:02:25.620> bit<00:02:25.770> more<00:02:25.920> vertical<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
to be a little bit more vertical so to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.840 
to be a little bit more vertical so to
lift<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> ball<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> net<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.580> if

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
lift the ball up over the net but if

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.340 
lift the ball up over the net but if
there's<00:02:30.090> no<00:02:30.330> spin<00:02:30.660> or<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.170> bit<00:02:31.260> of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
there's no spin or a little bit of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.100 
there's no spin or a little bit of
topspin<00:02:31.800> then<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.880> come<00:02:33.120> more<00:02:33.569> forward

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
topspin then you can come more forward

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050 
topspin then you can come more forward
on<00:02:34.410> your<00:02:34.470> stroke<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.730> you're<00:02:35.850> getting

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
on your stroke so that you're getting

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
on your stroke so that you're getting
the<00:02:36.150> ball<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.510> forward<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.680> real

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the ball going forward the real

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.250 
the ball going forward the real
advantage<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.610> stroke<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:40.080> an

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
advantage of this stroke is that it's an

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.229 
advantage of this stroke is that it's an
attacking<00:02:40.650> stroke<00:02:41.100> off<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> short<00:02:41.670> ball<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
attacking stroke off a short ball and

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.850 
attacking stroke off a short ball and
that<00:02:42.750> means<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.170> you're<00:02:43.380> taking<00:02:43.769> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that means that you're taking the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
that means that you're taking the
initiative<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.700> rally<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.780> side

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
initiative in the rally and the side

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.320 
initiative in the rally and the side
spin<00:02:46.620> makes<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.130> really<00:02:47.400> awkward<00:02:47.550> for<00:02:48.209> your

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
spin makes it really awkward for your

00:02:48.330 --> 00:03:14.870 
spin makes it really awkward for your
opponent<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.870> return<00:03:13.220> from<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.400> angle<00:03:14.579> you

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
opponent to return from this angle you

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.490 
opponent to return from this angle you
can<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.239> see<00:03:15.480> how<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.900> sign<00:03:16.140> spinning

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
can really see how this sign spinning

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.800 
can really see how this sign spinning
causes<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.310> ball<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> curve<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.299> make<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
causes the ball to curve and make it

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:37.410 
causes the ball to curve and make it
difficult<00:03:19.049> for<00:03:19.350> your<00:03:19.530> opponent

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.210 

so<00:03:38.420> there<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.750> have<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.140> backhand<00:03:39.620> side<00:03:39.860> spin

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
so there you have the backhand side spin

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.910 
so there you have the backhand side spin
flick<00:03:40.660> don't<00:03:41.660> forget<00:03:41.990> that's<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.650> very

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
flick don't forget that's a very

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.400 
flick don't forget that's a very
advanced<00:03:43.580> technique<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.660> takes<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.050> lot<00:03:45.380> of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
advanced technique and it takes a lot of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.280 
advanced technique and it takes a lot of
years<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.830> practice<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.430> master<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.930> taken

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
years of practice to master it's taken

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.809 
years of practice to master it's taken
me<00:03:48.320> several<00:03:48.620> years<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.100> master<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.490> myself

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
me several years to master it myself

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.879 
me several years to master it myself
