 cited summer hole at least in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 would appear in lower months 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.730
 preview gives an overview of what 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.730

 fighting game soffin kanitz that's already 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 for quite some time in early access 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.920
 program of steam game was that it on 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.079
 the first month of the fall leaves it open canoe 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.469
 opposes battles in format two 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.269
 two 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.219
 so you always fighting with a 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.010
 mates against another player 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.839
 in which 3d aren should not be 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.180
 only on the correct timing when using 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.259
 from near and farfight attacks arrive 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.930
 but also the right one 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.430
 interaction of team members, the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.100
 game relies on a free to play 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.539
 Payment model of known type of construction per week 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.670

 release currency permanently 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.050
 Also there's of course for example 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.050
 to buy different costumes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.910

 emphasizes down-to-earth middle age 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.340

 look at minecraft as well 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.090

 example dungeons it plays then 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.000
 but clearly different than that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.900
 sandbox classic who is curious 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.760

 the next round 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.660
 the developers promise one 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.860
 improved graphics thanks to new engine 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.690

 both with his name and with 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.770
 its optics, the indie game applies to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.050
 dungeon ehringfeld on and it has one 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.060
 interesting game concept steered in 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.590
 turn-based play a hero 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.540
 through a dungeon hers 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.190
 meanwhile with the help of playing cards 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.020
 build yourself first 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.420
 you are not controlling your hero 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.430
 but you can actively do it eg with the help of 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.290
 Gold pieces through the dungeon lotsen 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.090
 On top of that, you have to leave the dungeon like that 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.800
 click together that your fighter to 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.060
 for example too big ones 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.950
 appreciate 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.490
 their positions partly namely 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.770
 are specified who the popular trials 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.110
 series around tricky motorcycle tricks 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.510
 and challenges quite different 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.150
 who wants to be at the oz 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.000
 level max extension that brings 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.320
 including 40 new routes 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.780
 challenges and objects for the

 stretch editor and exchange the 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.070
 previous driver from transfusion against 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.710
 A heavily armed cat on the 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.810
 riding a fire-spitting unicorn 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.890
 which gives out of the level max expansions 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.290

 get in again for everyone 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.430
 that also looks like limbo gets along 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.560
 probably most of the players in the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.539
 meaning when you see feisty for the first time 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.370

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.479
 a being through a mysterious world 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.189
 full of dangers 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.259
 you jump through forests climbing 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.779
 caves and swamps swiss 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.099
 Developer of bits and pieces 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.349
 do without their own statements 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.419
 on scripted sequences the opponents 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.439
 should be pure by artificial intelligence 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.439
 act controlled 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.900

 in the final version at the end of July 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.140
 the action roleplay should be 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.670

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.380
 Distinguish control 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.720
 For example, Victor can be the main character 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.460
 also jump and so the one or 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.990
 discover other secret
