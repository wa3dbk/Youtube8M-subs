00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hi guys, I'm here with you, angelica 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.460
 today I came to make a video of favorites 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.910
 of the month of july 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 help because it's been a long time since 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.130
 I am biblical in and close to the date of the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.369
 end cloud on which would start showing 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.230
 Both of them went before I'm crazy about 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 experiences you then the first 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 want to show this ball and code is not it is 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.730
 a sugar student and bought states 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.529
 united but there is quite easy time has gone 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.430
 very easy to find he has more than one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.610
 branch supermarket pharmacy has and it is 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 from ezzor and have good ones that I like 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.860
 cbg 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 The smell is good but what I wanted 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.750
 even is independent of wanted brand 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.420
 try a good choice of sugar 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.879
 with the body because I already have it because I 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 His years are very thick as well. 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.539
 strong 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 this here is very very very very good 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.300
 and it was super good and how does it look that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.789
 says that there is where avocado xia bush 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 chirata laura sementinha 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.250
 I do not know well the truth is that I found 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.960
 which hydrates at the same time as it 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.479
 chose because of the oil 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.170
 I even threw it on my face and I know 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170
 which is not indicated 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 I prayed, I think if you could not 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 Do you like to choose before and never? 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.950
 tried sugar 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.200
 maybe it's a good alternative you? 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.450
 find what you find one of the face 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.500
 you know of another brand that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.119
 be it sugar 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.060
 here in Brazil even for any 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.860
 comments rita all quite but not 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 I know it will end I wanted to test 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 another new adilson wants to be small 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.940
 Messi again I'll choose what I 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
 I wanted to show that my dermatologist 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.740
 indicated he always looked for the steering wheel 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.399
 you walk is no undecided 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.149
 I did not like any of them. 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.630
 Melvin and yes it's the pharmacy then 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.560
 You can find but to get a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.160
 good management 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 This is on the der es kimm da aqmi I think 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.700
 that his name 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.120
 here he has a little 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.959
 very rigid children so there a lot 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.360
 quantity is no longer that little john that 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.000
 has almost nothing of pebbles 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.709
 videos from the same client and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 they may as well have told you to use 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.060
 every day but I think it depends 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.410
 So much of everyone then but I think 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.959
 that if you are looking for the choice of 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.519
 which is but was there enough to clean 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.160
 well the skin I think this is a good 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.260
 alternative had a photo and a link from the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.150
 blog when I leave down here and 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.910
 everything else your product information 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.549
 I also wanted to show in the brushes. 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.880
 starting with these here river technics 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:50.880
 I bought a date and even saw them. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.980
 I liked it the most, it was the one from here that is the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.900
 Lipstick blush I bought what to have 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.540
 prudence in fact and he does not 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.910
 disappointed a little use he did not 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.280
 can apply the base gets the pointer 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.940
 even more prepared on the face and let 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.430
 a very uniform layer not too heavy 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.160
 but also does not take as much of the product 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.230
 I liked it very hard for you to slope 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.780
 a good finish to the bottom I think 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.740
 everyone has something so exact like that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.090
 also not so much as an ounce 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.360
 This is what I was looking for here because 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.720
 my two here too that is against 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.120
 clock and the policy foundation roche 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.300
 This one was the least I liked and only me 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.860
 I used it just to stay and take a peek and 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.380
 honestly I can do this with him 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.210
 with a coffee mess with my duty that is 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.410
 both cat's tongue looks only at the tongue of 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.230
 mexico cat 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.510
 comparing the two goals, you can see that 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.060
 which is much smaller and the bristles will 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.070
 getting smaller here but I think it leaves 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.220
 a much lighter finish than this 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.040
 here we sincerely need to investigate 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.590
 but we here to get around the face is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.990
 very very very very very good even 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.970
 had one of those points 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.820
 I really liked it, maybe it's the best 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.700
 but still like the 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.190
 beveled to apply bronze and one more 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.320
 The other one I wanted to show is a different one. 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.410
 that were in Brazilian pharmacies and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.340
 is from dailus and he is a group 20 and is a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.460
 collective bristle brush with lots of bristle 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.400
 I really liked it though it leaves a 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.340
 operation with the finish much more 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.010
 heavy but I liked to apply it to 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.470
 others with the inscription because I did it on 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.990
 friends house 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.000
 We had to leave this week and I used it. 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.280
 Yes, heaven. I liked it a lot more to stay. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.960
 in others you can play well 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.470
 here under the eye for whom neither the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.500
 put the finger even if then that damage 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.690
 not organic and my eye to morals or 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.570
 brush for suzano the others I do 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.030
 makeup work none of this 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.690
 but if you do maybe it's a good 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.790
 alternative 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.640
 I liked it a lot and I wanted to show 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.680
 My word is that I'm talking. 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.280
 express or c 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.300
 In the video of little band Loving her 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.280
 We are going to compose traveling. 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.560
 I'm definitely going to buy the machine. 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.720
 because it is the quality of this is not 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.900
 so same thing like that 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.270
 their fate is for me but he 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.630
 this super cool stuff she is ne 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.220
 a little bit but the practical mark much more 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.090
 He is much more handsome and much more. 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.430
 expensive but much more beautiful is and I loved it 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.590
 Is not it time to use it from here? 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.290
 short as a punch here in the 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.010
 very thin people do not is already a thing 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.550
 huh 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.300
 If you want the braga was up to champion. 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.570
 says Copetti is to be should enjoy 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.920
 look for it and alex or feet and I give 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.320
 using this 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.610
 another thing we have to whom it is said in 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.250
 my youtube channel 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.560
 In the book we have trouble with 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.770
 Voter I never spoke but I ah nor a 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:06.200
 jumped up college chicken she won 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:08.780
 a book on that 3 6 and 1 do what 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.060
 but it is the one that last wheel 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.640
 I liked him because I just got lots of 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.050
 attention and type 7 books so and when 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.620
 have more than one book in the 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.420
 college said 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.300
 an illustrated history of the beautiful 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.640
 bizarre is it really shows 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.710
 horrible trends they've had until 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.850
 because we have never met or under 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:35.840
 old story tells the story of several 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.840
 things in the autos of much of the same 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.290
 makeup hair shoe all related 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.690
 stylish and very cool really cool 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.330
 Note that he would buy it so I 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.800
 I would buy one more book one from some 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.840
 story is such a thing for the 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.980
 college even though I'm not motorbike 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.530
 design 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.490
 finally much to do with it but the 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.050
 little boy, right? 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.140
 depending on the area the following I 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:03.440
 I loved it a lot and I wanted to show it here. 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:07.640
 even because law is kind of related to fashion 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:11.390
 beauty and another house I wanted to talk to 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.420
 that I watched plans to score with the gt 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.220
 but this is a great team I love 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.500
 do for the monkeys from the grounds 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.660

 underneath my last video which is a 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.770

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.400
 very long video 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.700
