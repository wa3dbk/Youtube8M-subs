00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.680 
there's just a teeny bit sticking out
and<00:01:45.620> take<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> piece<00:01:46.910> of<00:01:46.940> mold<00:01:47.390> sealer<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:49.730> put

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
doing here is sealing up that hole so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.730 
doing here is sealing up that hole so
none<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.220> wax<00:01:55.430> will<00:01:55.670> leak<00:01:55.850> out<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.650> you

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
none of the wax will leak out so you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.930 
none of the wax will leak out so you
want<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.100> push<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.460> down<00:01:58.490> make<00:01:58.910> sure

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
want to just push it down make sure

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.430 
want to just push it down make sure
you've<00:01:59.270> got<00:01:59.300> every<00:01:59.750> bit<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.080> wick

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
you've got every bit of that wick

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.590 
you've got every bit of that wick
covered<00:02:00.920> because<00:02:01.580> if<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.820> don't<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.390> wax

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
covered because if you don't the wax

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.740 
covered because if you don't the wax
will<00:02:02.930> seep<00:02:03.860> out<00:02:04.040> through<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.640> wick<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.090> leak

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
will seep out through the wick and leak

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.350 
will seep out through the wick and leak
everywhere<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.400> want<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> push<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:07.850> mold

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
