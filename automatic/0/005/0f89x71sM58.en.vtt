00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 for a start we will collect 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.060
 my sector 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.910
 I chewed myself a pancake and two springs 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.740
 a month shaft now I'll show you how 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.800
 to collect 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.769
 prove to be this way you collect this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.260
 big spring like this it should you 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.879
 there is just a little gearing 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 insert here though in principle 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.830
 then you can put a little 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.430
 and everything and here you need to attach a little 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:48.690
 the forces to set his court right 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.570
 part of the spring rests here on 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.600
 this one here he relies 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.219
 accordingly, we apply a little force 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.219
 to wrap up here 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:14.799
 not easy enough operation 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.159
 nothing complicated there is just need to pray 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.740
 a little effort and all his progress on this 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.530
 the shaft that stood there and the huskies 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.930
 squad here everything is quite clearly worth 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.770
 next we put this spring which 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.119
 will give us back the exporter 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 here back and install this shaft here 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.770
 which, in principle, all this will fix 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:48.070
 so that it is not considered all shaft us 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.250
 installed and everything is tight enough here 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.610
 she keeps like that should go then 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.500
 there is nothing you need to fly out of course 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.619
 if she clearly keeps everything 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.780
 ok next we proceed to 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:08.530
 installing a chain drive this difficult 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:19.410
 sprocket chair the germans are so collected and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:21.880
 then just put the top down 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.630
 There are no problems and installed 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:33.940
 bushing basket clutch it on with us 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:40.380
 so fun all set by art 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:45.010
 or tt is spinning normally so it means 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.250
 wind the nut of the motor star until 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.739
 what's by hand just to fix 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.670
 so now we will dress like this 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.030
 special puck the essence of this puck is 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.250
 that there are such grooves here 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.730
 which should not be put down naturally 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.510
 they coincide with the slots in the very 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.130
 tables and it will be fixed you 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.319
 leave yes that is recommend 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.890
 use this because once i 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.630
 sent the usual even curved but mine 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.120
 at risk 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.910
 studied accordingly grip first 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:30.180
 led and then just a motorcycle 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:32.210
 stopped here means that you have to go now! 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.760
 we have this nut 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:42.020
 which we wrap a pilaf like us 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.500
 screw up the puck 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.530
 there is nothing untwisted here means 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.770
 Now head on 19 I pulled up 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:04:07.370
 also fix it with a screwdriver because 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:10.110
 that davis is spinning baskets and tables 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.210
 remained significantly each other in 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.910
 so thought so will not come off 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.549
 and now I have a little pull up well as it 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.180
 okay so tightened with 5 eyes 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.850
 drag to bear and I rip 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.560
 because if you rip there will be a lot 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:36.060
 problems now we delayed him now 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.720
 chisel and hammer and now bent the edges of this 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.280
 washers 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.280
 so she kept the nut
