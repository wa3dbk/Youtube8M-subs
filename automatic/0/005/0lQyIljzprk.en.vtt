 Y 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.560
 hello here we are once again from birds 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.580
 educate as close to Christmas as 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.340
 we are now 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.890
 we have prepared a Christmas menu 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.110
 we have thought that since surely 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.970
 you'll still be on the diet and it's a 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.180
 It's a shame we think about leaving it in these 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.489
 holidays or that we think bitter 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.380
 that we will not be able to eat dishes 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.300
 specials then we have prepared this 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.760
 Christmas menu so you can really 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.129
 enjoy even some dishes you'll see 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 what can you do with all your 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 family 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 I brought as an incoming 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.039
 It's a salad with sea sticks 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.489
 cheese burgos and stuffed eggs so 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.469
 You can see the recipe video right here 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.470
 as main course some breasts 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.690
 Stuffed with ham and cheese with a sauce 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.259
 of cheese and accompanied by vegetables or 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.020
 this case used asparagus and carrots 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.840
 we are chocolate

 it's really very fast to do very 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.150
 similar to the lemon mousse we have 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.740
 done previously and with these sticks 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.360
 crispy that I'll also teach you to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.050
 make them see what you expect they are very 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.150
 easy the mousse if you give the dessert 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.520
 to all the guests that day nobody goes to 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.440
 tell it's not a mousse of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 traditional and good so that too 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.850
 have something sweet when it comes to providing 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.360
