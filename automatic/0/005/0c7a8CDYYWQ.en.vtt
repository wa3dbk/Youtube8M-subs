00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.120

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.730

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 description of the video when they have 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.390
 and they get into the folder 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.670
 when they are in the folder they will look at two 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.430
 files the first one to execute is the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.500
 dock netflix and they give it like that and it will start 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.510
 to install but I give it not because 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.340
 I have it put then they give it to the san 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.380
 andreas not to install that is the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.840
 program to put the cars there 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.330
 they give so they give to next there they put the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.590
 where they have the gta san andreas and 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.630
 they give it to next 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.760
 next there you start to install 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.160
 but I canceled it because I already have it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.610
 but you clearly do not cancel it 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.610
 xd 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.500
 Now I will show how to put a car 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.630
 first we open the san andreas mod 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.670
 install look there is x of we give 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.620
 click but first you have to download a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.480
 I'll leave the link where 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.000
 download real cars for your san 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 we give to install moore here they put 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.140
 the address of where is your san 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.300

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 down they put the address where they have 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.160
 the car 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.780
