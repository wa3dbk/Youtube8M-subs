we'll start with the right foot first
BCM<00:00:30.860> I<00:00:31.009> put<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.400> sender

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.580 

all<00:00:43.670> right<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.150> then<00:00:44.300> on<00:00:44.540> my<00:00:44.810> left<00:00:45.050> foot<00:00:45.320> I'll

all right and then on my left foot I'll

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.860 
all right and then on my left foot I'll
be<00:00:45.770> using<00:00:45.950> an<00:00:46.550> old<00:00:46.820> Gibbs<00:00:47.120> ascender<00:00:47.600> which<00:00:47.720> is

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
be using an old Gibbs ascender which is

00:00:47.870 --> 00:01:13.450 
be using an old Gibbs ascender which is
hooked<00:00:48.050> up<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.820> custom<00:00:49.820> stone

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.680 

all<00:01:14.000> right<00:01:15.610> steel<00:01:16.610> plate<00:01:16.910> inside<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.510> that

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
all right steel plate inside here that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.240 
all right steel plate inside here that
keeps<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.760> keeps<00:01:19.760> it<00:01:19.940> nice<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.120> secure<00:01:21.250> okay

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
keeps it keeps it nice and secure okay

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.890 
keeps it keeps it nice and secure okay
so<00:01:22.310> those<00:01:22.670> are<00:01:22.730> my<00:01:22.970> three<00:01:23.180> pieces<00:01:23.360> there's<00:01:23.750> one

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
so those are my three pieces there's one

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.720 
so those are my three pieces there's one
more<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.170> go<00:01:24.320> later<00:01:24.620> but<00:01:24.860> we'll<00:01:25.010> get<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.700> that

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
more to go later but we'll get to that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:35.859 
more to go later but we'll get to that
in<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.060> second<00:01:26.710> go<00:01:27.710> ahead<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:30.040> see<00:01:31.040> em<00:01:31.160> I<00:01:34.869> make

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
in a second go ahead and see em I make

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.359 
in a second go ahead and see em I make
sure<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.170> bungee<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:36.560> not<00:01:36.770> going<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.010> tangled

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
sure the bungee is not going to tangled

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:55.150 
sure the bungee is not going to tangled
up<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:52.300> make<00:01:53.300> sure<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:53.509> everything<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.500> not

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
up and make sure that everything is not

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.580 
up and make sure that everything is not
twisted<00:01:55.640> up<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.740> then<00:01:58.190> all<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.320> bungee<00:02:00.320> is<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
twisted up and then all the bungee is a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.030 
twisted up and then all the bungee is a
little<00:02:00.979> pulley<00:02:01.250> it's<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.060> little<00:02:02.300> ronnstam<00:02:03.040> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
little pulley it's a little ronnstam and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.609 
little pulley it's a little ronnstam and
I've<00:02:04.399> got<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.580> carabiner<00:02:05.030> up<00:02:05.240> here<00:02:05.509> then<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.410> cook

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
I've got a carabiner up here then I cook

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.050 
I've got a carabiner up here then I cook
that<00:02:06.830> too<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.280> that's<00:02:07.399> kind<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.850> secret

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
that too and that's kind of the secret

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.840 
that too and that's kind of the secret
to<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.420> whole<00:02:08.570> system<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.459> find<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
to the whole system not to find the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.220 
to the whole system not to find the
stuff<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.270> second<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.720> last<00:02:14.750> step<00:02:15.080> is

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
stuff the second and last step is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.680 
stuff the second and last step is
difficult

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
difficult

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.000 

I<00:02:17.720> always<00:02:18.049> pull<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> make<00:02:18.530> sure<00:02:18.769> it's<00:02:18.890> hooked

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
I always pull to make sure it's hooked

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.780 
I always pull to make sure it's hooked
in<00:02:19.299> over<00:02:20.299> here<00:02:20.860> fun<00:02:21.860> stuff<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:23.330> eunice<00:02:23.690> Endor

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.180 

it's<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> Whoopie<00:02:30.920> sling

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
it's on like so I have a Whoopie sling

00:02:31.190 --> 00:04:06.620 
it's on like so I have a Whoopie sling
right<00:02:31.400> here

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.880 

there<00:04:07.630> we<00:04:07.720> go<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.860> then<00:04:09.430> release<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.330> CMI<00:04:10.990> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
there we go and then release the CMI and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.460 
there we go and then release the CMI and
at<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.160> point<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.610> could<00:04:12.670> just<00:04:12.940> pull<00:04:13.290> I'm<00:04:14.290> not

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
at this point I could just pull I'm not

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.250 
at this point I could just pull I'm not
super<00:04:14.890> smooth<00:04:15.130> with<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.820> unit<00:04:16.570> center<00:04:16.810> yet<00:04:16.989> so

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
super smooth with the unit center yet so

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:45.450 
super smooth with the unit center yet so
I<00:04:17.590> like<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.190> do<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:20.080> slow<00:04:20.410> descent

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.470 

so<00:04:46.460> that's<00:04:46.640> all<00:04:46.820> it<00:04:46.970> takes

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
so that's all it takes

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.420 
so that's all it takes
I<00:04:47.620> don't<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.800> switch<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.280> different

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
I don't have to switch to a different

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.420 
I don't have to switch to a different
device<00:04:50.500> thanks<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.620> lot<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.890> Burnham<00:04:52.220> for

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
letting me use this for a couple of

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.660 
letting me use this for a couple of
months<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:54.140> been<00:04:54.230> a<00:04:54.350> great<00:04:54.680> addition<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.460> my

months it's been a great addition to my

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.490 
months it's been a great addition to my
climbing<00:04:56.030> system<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:56.990> it's<00:04:57.110> going<00:04:57.230> to<00:04:57.290> hurt

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
climbing system and it's going to hurt

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:15.850 
climbing system and it's going to hurt
to<00:04:57.650> send<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:57.980> back

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.230 

so<00:05:16.860> I'm<00:05:16.950> using<00:05:17.190> my<00:05:17.400> left<00:05:17.610> hand<00:05:17.730> to<00:05:18.000> guide

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
so I'm using my left hand to guide

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240 
so I'm using my left hand to guide
myself<00:05:18.570> on<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:18.990> rope<00:05:19.170> oh<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.740> probably<00:05:19.860> helps

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
myself on the rope oh it probably helps

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.290 
myself on the rope oh it probably helps
if<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.520> connect<00:05:20.880> myself<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.650> roller<00:05:26.300> show

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
if I connect myself to the roller show

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.490 
if I connect myself to the roller show
you<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.630> in<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.840> second<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:32.460> have<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.500> shoulder

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
you that in a second I have the shoulder

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.400 
you that in a second I have the shoulder
harness<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:36.210> connected<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.200> is<00:05:37.380> a

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
harness and connected to that is a

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.500 
harness and connected to that is a
Simmons<00:05:37.890> roller<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.430> there's<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:38.970> steel<00:05:39.240> plate

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
Simmons roller and there's a steel plate

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.210 
Simmons roller and there's a steel plate
inside<00:05:39.930> here<00:05:40.170> that<00:05:40.200> helps<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.740> keep<00:05:40.920> the

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
inside here that helps to keep the
