management<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.070> important<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.790> play

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000

printed<00:02:00.570> black<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.079> white<00:02:01.820> that's<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> lie<00:02:03.439> but

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
printed black and white that's a lie but

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.639 
printed black and white that's a lie but
it<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.740> meant<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.189> joke

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.850 

yeah<00:02:10.450> color-matching<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:12.350> can<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.650> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
yeah color-matching you can see that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
yeah color-matching you can see that
it's<00:02:13.010> grayed<00:02:13.460> out<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.910> color<00:02:14.180> sync<00:02:14.510> has<00:02:14.720> been

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
it's grayed out and color sync has been

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.570 
it's grayed out and color sync has been
been<00:02:15.860> applied<00:02:16.720> by<00:02:17.720> default<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:19.370> cannot

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
been applied by default and I cannot

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.220 
been applied by default and I cannot
change<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:24.500> reason<00:02:24.920> why<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.390> grayed

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
change it the reason why it is grayed

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.420 
change it the reason why it is grayed
out<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.680> because<00:02:28.520> in<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.030> Lightroom<00:02:30.430> options

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
out is because in the Lightroom options

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.320 
out is because in the Lightroom options
I<00:02:31.670> chose<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.959> use<00:02:33.310> color<00:02:34.310> profile<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.970> apply<00:02:35.300> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
I chose to use color profile to apply a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.720 
I chose to use color profile to apply a
color<00:02:35.840> profile<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.520> made

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
color profile that I have made

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.720 
color profile that I have made
previously<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.739> other<00:02:39.890> choice<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.400> managed

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
previously the other choice is managed

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.130 
previously the other choice is managed
by<00:02:40.790> printer<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:41.510> if<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.720> choose<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.080> option

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
by printer but if you choose that option

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.550 
by printer but if you choose that option
there's<00:02:42.980> no<00:02:43.130> point<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.640> having<00:02:44.270> color<00:02:45.170> monkey

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
there's no point in having color monkey

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.590 
there's no point in having color monkey
because<00:02:45.950> you're<00:02:46.550> not<00:02:46.700> applying<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.300> print<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
because you're not applying to print a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.140 
because you're not applying to print a
profile<00:02:48.020> you've<00:02:48.200> made<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.370> I'm<00:02:49.670> going<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
profile you've made so I'm going to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.150 
profile you've made so I'm going to
apply<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.080> printer<00:02:51.980> profile<00:02:53.470> wrap<00:02:54.470> and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
apply this printer profile wrap and

but color sink aha okay maybe that's

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.229 
but color sink aha okay maybe that's

the the test targets that are the tower
but<00:03:33.980> no<00:03:34.959> because<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.230> found<00:03:36.920> out<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.519> if<00:03:38.030> you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
but no because I found out that if you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.610 
but no because I found out that if you
do<00:03:38.329> that<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:40.040> will<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.700> up

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
do that you will it up

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.940 
do that you will it up
really<00:03:42.620> because<00:03:44.110> color<00:03:45.110> sink<00:03:45.320> will<00:03:45.590> apply

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
really because color sink will apply

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.600 
really because color sink will apply
color<00:03:46.880> management<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.560> test<00:03:48.950> targets<00:03:49.400> and

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
color management to the test targets and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.729 
color management to the test targets and
then<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.150> measure<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.810> first<00:03:50.989> test<00:03:51.320> target

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
then you measure the first test target

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.640 
then you measure the first test target
and<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:52.600> have<00:03:53.600> applied<00:03:53.900> color<00:03:54.140> sink<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.620> it

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
and you have applied color sink to it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.170 
and you have applied color sink to it
and<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:57.140> then<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.799> print<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.579> second<00:03:58.970> test

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
and and then you print the second test

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.300 
and and then you print the second test
test<00:03:59.630> chart<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.110> then<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.410> apply<00:04:00.680> color<00:04:01.040> sink

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
test chart and then you apply color sink

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.699 
test chart and then you apply color sink
to<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.940> resulting<00:04:02.780> profile<00:04:03.260> will<00:04:03.530> be

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
to it and the resulting profile will be

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.350 
to it and the resulting profile will be
totally<00:04:04.190> skewed<00:04:04.790> up<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:07.640> have<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.880> choose

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
totally skewed up so you have to choose

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.250 
totally skewed up so you have to choose
vendor<00:04:09.230> matching<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:11.450> color<00:04:11.840> options

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
vendor matching and in color options

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.979 
vendor matching and in color options
drive<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:12.769> matching<00:04:13.310> that's<00:04:13.640> fine<00:04:13.880> but<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.780> can

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
drive a matching that's fine but you can

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.129 
drive a matching that's fine but you can
also<00:04:15.169> change<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.949> none<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.269> then<00:04:17.930> in

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
also change it to none and then in

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.550 
also change it to none and then in
summary<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:19.070> should<00:04:19.730> check<00:04:20.000> before

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
summary you should check before

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.340 
summary you should check before
you<00:04:20.650> print<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.120> sets<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.510> endor<00:04:22.900> matching

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
you print that it sets of endor matching

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:32.520 
you print that it sets of endor matching
and<00:04:23.940> said<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:26.820> color<00:04:27.820> correction<00:04:28.210> none<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:32.290> as

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
and said to color correction none you as

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.560 
and said to color correction none you as
you<00:04:32.680> can<00:04:32.860> see<00:04:33.040> is<00:04:33.250> set<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.610> two<00:04:33.970> plain<00:04:34.240> paper

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
you can see is set to two plain paper

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.350 
you can see is set to two plain paper
which<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.050> obviously<00:04:35.740> wrong<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.090> small

note<00:04:37.600> on<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:40.740> paper<00:04:42.060> choices<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.290> would<00:04:44.290> choose

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
note on the paper choices I would choose

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.720 
note on the paper choices I would choose
just<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.460> best<00:04:45.700> one<00:04:46.260> because<00:04:47.260> my<00:04:48.160> printer<00:04:48.700> is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
just the best one because my printer is

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.460 
just the best one because my printer is
not<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.060> professional<00:04:49.660> printer<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.110> therefore

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
not a professional printer and therefore

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.129 
not a professional printer and therefore
I<00:04:50.500> cannot<00:04:50.860> set<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.820> dots<00:04:52.419> per<00:04:52.630> inch

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
I cannot set the dots per inch

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.370 
I cannot set the dots per inch
I<00:04:53.460> can<00:04:54.460> only<00:04:54.610> set<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.090> print<00:04:55.510> quality<00:04:55.810> too

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
I can only set this print quality too

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.060 
I can only set this print quality too
fast<00:04:56.710> or<00:04:57.070> fine<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.870> order<00:04:59.229> to<00:04:59.410> be<00:04:59.860> able<00:04:59.950> to

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
crank it all the way up this is the only

I can only crank it up till here if I

all<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.040> way<00:05:21.220> up<00:05:21.400> but<00:05:22.210> then<00:05:22.450> you<00:05:23.110> might<00:05:23.290> ask

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
all the way up but then you might ask

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.610 
all the way up but then you might ask
what<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.130> you're<00:05:24.310> using<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:25.000> matte<00:05:25.810> paper<00:05:26.169> or

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
what if you're using a matte paper or

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.980 
what if you're using a matte paper or
some<00:05:27.100> other<00:05:27.250> paper<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.360> ink<00:05:28.390> flow

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
some other paper and the ink flow

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.320 
some other paper and the ink flow
doesn't<00:05:29.470> match<00:05:29.680> well<00:05:30.160> I<00:05:31.380> would<00:05:32.380> say<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:33.330> the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
doesn't match well I would say that the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.170 
doesn't match well I would say that the
best<00:05:34.450> way<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:34.979> fix<00:05:35.979> it<00:05:36.130> is<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.610> use<00:05:36.880> this

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.100 
best way to fix it is to use this
setting<00:05:37.510> or<00:05:37.780> this<00:05:37.990> setting<00:05:38.320> of<00:05:38.470> course<00:05:40.110> before

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
setting or this setting of course before

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.620 
setting or this setting of course before
you<00:05:41.650> make<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.520> targets<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.150> then<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.360> print

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
you make the targets and then you print

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.740 
you make the targets and then you print
the<00:05:43.780> targets<00:05:44.220> and<00:05:45.419> then<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.539> make<00:05:46.720> your

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
the targets and then you make your

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.659 
the targets and then you make your
profile<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:51.660> this<00:05:52.660> is<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.990> way<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:54.460> should<00:05:54.639> be

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
profile so this is the way it should be

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.650 
profile so this is the way it should be
setup<00:05:55.020> when<00:05:56.020> you<00:05:56.200> are<00:05:56.410> making<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:58.060> test

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
setup when you are making the test

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.690 
setup when you are making the test
targets<00:05:59.169> and<00:05:59.380> then<00:05:59.770> when<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.160> are<00:06:00.250> printing

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
targets and then when you are printing

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.650 
targets and then when you are printing
you<00:06:01.510> should<00:06:01.750> be<00:06:01.900> fine<00:06:02.139> applying<00:06:03.360> color<00:06:04.360> sync

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
you should be fine applying color sync

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.450 
you should be fine applying color sync
and<00:06:04.900> then<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.169> profile<00:06:05.620> will<00:06:05.860> be<00:06:05.889> properly

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
and then the profile will be properly

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.360 
and then the profile will be properly
applied<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.389> then<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:08.080> will<00:06:08.260> work<00:06:08.440> thanks

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
applied and and then it will work thanks

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.010 
applied and and then it will work thanks
