00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.239
 a lot is talked about these days about him 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.239
 the new iphone 3gs 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.849
 we have had the possibility to try it for a few days 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 and we will try in this video t show you all the news that 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.119
 incorporate 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.679
 the characteristics that 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.050
 it seems that no 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.520
 this new 3g terminal 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.350
 Presents itself 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.680
 with the new configurations that the previous version 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.630
 in 8 16 gigas country 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.710
 as well as the integrated digital camera 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.770
 it's back to 2 megapixels 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.390
 the material of the shell on its back 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.590
 if it has been modified and instead of being metallic it is now made of black plastic 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.360
 or white 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.910
 this because it nicely covers the terminal and allows the reception of 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 the signal is more direct avoiding 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.389
 aesthetic interference from which some users came complaining 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.249
 it also turns out to be up here we have lighter a total of 136 grams 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.010
 regarding other meras and connectors say that the headphone has been modified 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.130
 so that it now supports most of the designs and other manufacturers with 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.090
 possibility of using conventional headphones the speakers located in 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.579
 the lower part of the device 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.490
 they have also been improved by raising their sound power 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.680
 said that the real difference with respect to model 12 is the inclusion 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.220
 connectivity 3g 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.200
 supporting past data services a few standards 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.420
 so sdp active mts 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 with a significant increase in speed in downloads and in the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200
 web page visualization 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 The incorporation of 3g offers clear advantages in terms of speed of 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.750
 Connection 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.430
 at jaguar level the other big corporation is the gps receiver with what it contributes 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.190
 a great advantage to the Google maps application 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.870
 not only does it depend on the existence of a wi-fi connection to be able to put 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.970
 march the system 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.210
 but also instead of using positioning based on 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.330
 tribulation 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.310
 which implies very little precision the gps will use the satellites of 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.220
 navigation to provide the necessary reliability 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.970
 with detailed information 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.670
 of the location of places of interest 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.759
 the part of the katiba is that it requires 3g connectivity which implies a 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.429
 Consumption of the bandwidth of the rate contracted by each user 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.480
 at the support level, the most outstanding of which is the incorporation of sizing 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.559
 a centralized point for the distribution of applications 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.270
 both free and paid 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.430
 debutan in the new development applications focused mainly 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.699
 for professional users 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.749
 in order that there are no funds can interest those who 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.059
 usually use blackberry terminals 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:37.529
 is the case of support synchronization with microsoft excel active sync 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.339
 with what the employees of any company has access 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.919
 to your calendar of avalanches contacts and the most interesting thing that service mail push 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:45.549
 innings 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.219
 and cisco ip vpn support is also included, which will benefit the 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.760
 3g-based data connections when wi-fi connectivity is not used on the basis of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.860
 to our performance tests performed 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.040
 we have seen that 3g connectivity provides greater functionality 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.849
 however it turns out to be a negative factor in their autonomy 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.590
 apple has believed in the possibilities of its original battery and to tell the truth 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.459
 3g connections consume more than expected for example based on a 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.809
 daily civic use of voice calls 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.409
 combined with data access music playback and utilization 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.299
 of gps in a timely manner 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.489
 his autonomy did not exceed 20 hours 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.869
 among those previously arrested at the time 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.239
 For their part, professionals who wish to keep their mail synchronized 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.339
 with destination server 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.139
 for receiving messages 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.389
 they will also have reduced their capacity for autonomy 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.900
 On the other hand the YouTube boy is still blocked to transfer data 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.840
 as it happened in the first edition 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.920
 with what will allow us to exchange contacts with the memory of the hands 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.539
 free for example 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:48.889
 In short the ipad 3g is an excellent phone in terms of design 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.299
 Handling and shock capabilities 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.379
 everything that has gained in connectivity and access speed 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.569
 the loss of battery life 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.779
 where it seems to have taken a big step back 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.109
 to the point of offering range of autonomy 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.159
 comparable to mobile phones of past decades 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.219
 if one of the two that boasted an autonomy of almost 10 hours in 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.239
 conversation 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.239
 the 3g reduces its values ​​to practically half 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.969
 however nobody wants to give up their new possibilities with services and 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.680
 location-based programs that are sure to be arriving 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.570
 in the September issue of pc world magazine we can see a 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.159
 more in-depth analysis 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.789
 what we call face to face with the samsung convoy model act 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.940
 competitors that bases its operation 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.590
 in this operational murray points and we'll see if we really be at 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.889
 height
