guide to command blocks in this episode

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.030 
guide to command blocks in this episode
we're<00:00:12.540> having<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.809> look<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.110> using<00:00:13.290> custom<00:00:13.740> item

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
we're having a look at using custom item

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
we're having a look at using custom item
data<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.460> command<00:00:14.760> blocks<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.750> particular

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
data in command blocks in particular

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.050 
data in command blocks in particular
we'll<00:00:16.439> be<00:00:16.500> looking<00:00:16.619> at<00:00:16.860> the<00:00:16.920> give<00:00:17.070> command<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
we'll be looking at the give command so

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.280 
we'll be looking at the give command so
let's<00:00:18.240> start<00:00:18.420> off<00:00:18.599> by<00:00:18.750> running<00:00:18.930> through<00:00:19.200> the

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
let's start off by running through the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.470 
let's start off by running through the
syntax<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:19.920> game<00:00:20.099> art<00:00:20.400> firstly<00:00:21.360> we<00:00:21.450> have

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
syntax of the game art firstly we have

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.730 
syntax of the game art firstly we have
the<00:00:21.660> give<00:00:21.810> statement<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> player

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the give statement then the player

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.310 
the give statement then the player
specify<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> eye<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.970> CIT<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.020> amount<00:00:25.230> we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
specify in the eye you CIT the amount we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960 
specify in the eye you CIT the amount we
want<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.590> give<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.070> additional<00:00:26.520> damage<00:00:26.820> value

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
want to give the additional damage value

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000 
want to give the additional damage value
of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> item<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:28.289> what's<00:00:28.500> called<00:00:28.770> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
of the item and then what's called the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
of the item and then what's called the
metadata<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> really

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
metadata and that's the really

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.009 
metadata and that's the really
interesting<00:00:30.990> part<00:00:32.180> now<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.629> should<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.900> be

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
interesting part now that should all be

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.240 
interesting part now that should all be
quite<00:00:34.199> familiar<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.769> in<00:00:34.890> case<00:00:35.070> you're<00:00:35.190> not

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
quite familiar but in case you're not

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.770 
quite familiar but in case you're not
aware<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> damage<00:00:36.180> value<00:00:36.330> is<00:00:36.600> it's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
aware of what the damage value is it's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.259 
aware of what the damage value is it's
basically<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.590> additional<00:00:38.400> piece<00:00:38.519> of<00:00:38.580> data<00:00:38.940> in

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
basically an additional piece of data in

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.389 
basically an additional piece of data in
Minecraft<00:00:39.870> used<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> determine<00:00:40.590> between

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Minecraft used to determine between

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
Minecraft used to determine between
different<00:00:41.730> versions<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.420> leaves<00:00:42.719> or<00:00:43.020> logs<00:00:43.290> or

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
different versions of leaves or logs or

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.990 
different versions of leaves or logs or
to<00:00:43.620> keep<00:00:43.739> track<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> amount<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.520> times<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
to keep track of the amount of times and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
to keep track of the amount of times and
items<00:00:45.329> being<00:00:45.510> used<00:00:47.540> anyway<00:00:48.540> let's<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
items being used anyway let's go on to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
items being used anyway let's go on to
what<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.620> video<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:50.670> about

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
what this video is actually all about

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
what this video is actually all about
and<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> metadata<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> end<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and that's the metadata at the end of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
and that's the metadata at the end of
that<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> general<00:00:54.480> structure<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that so the general structure for this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.549 
that so the general structure for this
is<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> ideas<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.039> nbt<00:00:56.730> data<00:00:57.050> now<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.230> we're

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
is the ideas of nbt data now my we're

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
is the ideas of nbt data now my we're
going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.860> spawn<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> talk<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.699> our<00:00:59.789> mvt<00:01:00.270> tags

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
going to spawn as I talk to our mvt tags

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
going to spawn as I talk to our mvt tags
so<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.050> sort<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> thing<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:02.160> relevant

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so that sort of thing is really relevant

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.359 
so that sort of thing is really relevant
here<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.170> way<00:01:04.289> it's<00:01:04.410> organized<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
here but the way it's organized here is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
here but the way it's organized here is
through<00:01:05.670> curly<00:01:06.060> brackets<00:01:06.539> to<00:01:07.140> branch<00:01:07.710> around

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
through curly brackets to branch around

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.790 
through curly brackets to branch around
menus<00:01:08.720> now<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.990> may<00:01:10.200> sound<00:01:10.410> like<00:01:10.560> utter

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
menus now this may sound like utter

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.350 
menus now this may sound like utter
nonsense<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> moment<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> essence

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
nonsense at the moment but in essence

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.990 
nonsense at the moment but in essence
it's<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.810> quite<00:01:13.020> easy<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> understand

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's really quite easy to understand

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.859 
it's really quite easy to understand
let's<00:01:15.000> demonstrate<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.540> by<00:01:15.600> actually

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
let's demonstrate this by actually

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
let's demonstrate this by actually
having<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.260> look<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.590> tags<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> comparing

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
having a look at some tags and comparing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.200 
having a look at some tags and comparing
them<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> command<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.450> form<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.939> order

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
them to the command or form so in order

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
them to the command or form so in order
to<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.510> this<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> place<00:01:22.650> an<00:01:22.830> item<00:01:22.950> i

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
to do this I'm going to place an item i

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.830 
to do this I'm going to place an item i
want<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> give<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.970> chest<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.420> Minecraft

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
want to give in a chest in Minecraft

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.179 
want to give in a chest in Minecraft
then<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> hop<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.979> I've<00:01:26.100> been

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then I'm going to hop on I've been

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
then I'm going to hop on I've been
devastated<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:27.060> various<00:01:27.479> filters<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
devastated and use various filters to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990 
devastated and use various filters to
add<00:01:28.170> things<00:01:28.470> such<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.710> names<00:01:29.130> Lords<00:01:29.880> in
