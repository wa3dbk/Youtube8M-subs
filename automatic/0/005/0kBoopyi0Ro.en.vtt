00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
when you open up and should be a load of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.220 
when you open up and should be a load of
batteries<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.400> here

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
batteries in here

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.310 
batteries in here
but<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:13.440> I've<00:02:13.560> found<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:15.260> all<00:02:16.260> right

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
but what I've found is that all right

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.110 
but what I've found is that all right
let's<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.860> cut<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.220> cables<00:02:17.280> isn't<00:02:17.970> see

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
let's just cut these cables isn't see

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.250 
let's just cut these cables isn't see
there<00:02:18.270> are<00:02:18.390> batteries<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.960> they're<00:02:19.170> not

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
there are batteries and they're not

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.630 
there are batteries and they're not
quite<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.590> ones<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.860> expected<00:02:20.400> which<00:02:20.520> is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
quite the ones I expected which is

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.630 
quite the ones I expected which is
unfortunate<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:22.380> let's<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.010> cut<00:02:23.400> these

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
unfortunate but let's just cut these

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.660 
unfortunate but let's just cut these
before<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.330> damage<00:02:24.900> ourselves<00:02:25.050> okay<00:02:27.350> okay

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
before we damage ourselves okay okay

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.820 
before we damage ourselves okay okay
there<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:29.970> got<00:02:30.090> some<00:02:30.530> didn't<00:02:31.530> work<00:02:31.680> at

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
there you go you got some didn't work at

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.010 
there you go you got some didn't work at
all<00:02:31.980> nothing<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.570> batteries

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
all nothing to do with the batteries

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.770 
all nothing to do with the batteries
it's<00:02:34.320> supposed<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:35.600> that's<00:02:36.600> pretty

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
it's supposed to be that's pretty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.690 
it's supposed to be that's pretty
rubbish<00:02:37.020> isn't<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.650> these<00:02:37.770> are<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.100> usable

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
rubbish isn't it so these are not usable

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.720 
rubbish isn't it so these are not usable
batteries<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.720> all<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.770> wasted<00:02:41.130> my<00:02:41.160> money<00:02:41.400> on

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
batteries at all just wasted my money on

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.620 
batteries at all just wasted my money on
a<00:02:42.140> thingamabob<00:02:43.430> I'm<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.640> link<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.060> on

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
a thingamabob I'm going to link it on

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.240 
a thingamabob I'm going to link it on
the<00:02:45.810> video<00:02:45.900> obviously<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.650> America<00:02:47.100> or

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the video obviously in America or

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.370 
the video obviously in America or
particularly<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.270> type<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.570> battery<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.200> he

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
particularly the type of battery that he

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.150 
particularly the type of battery that he
had<00:02:49.620> he<00:02:50.310> opened<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.300> 36<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
had he opened it up and there was 36 of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040 
had he opened it up and there was 36 of
these<00:02:53.430> little<00:02:53.790> batteries<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
these little batteries in it the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.229 
these little batteries in it the
double-a<00:02:55.500> batteries<00:02:55.950> are<00:02:56.100> 36<00:02:56.820> double<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
double-a batteries are 36 double a

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.960 
double-a batteries are 36 double a
batteries<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.080> these<00:02:58.260> big<00:02:58.560> ones

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
batteries in one of these big ones

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.040 
batteries in one of these big ones
basically<00:02:59.970> how<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.150> worked<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> idea

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
basically how it worked is that the idea

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.340 
basically how it worked is that the idea
was<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> spend<00:03:02.010> 59<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.630> big<00:03:03.900> battery

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
was that you spend 59 on a big battery

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.770 
was that you spend 59 on a big battery
and<00:03:04.500> get<00:03:04.590> yourself<00:03:04.860> 36<00:03:05.640> double<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.209> batteries

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
and get yourself 36 double a batteries

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.890 
and get yourself 36 double a batteries
rather<00:03:07.620> than<00:03:07.770> spending<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.430> 499<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.570> eight

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
rather than spending like 499 on eight

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.650 
rather than spending like 499 on eight
double-a<00:03:10.860> batteries<00:03:11.340> but<00:03:11.550> Tim<00:03:11.850> as<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.600> can

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
double-a batteries but Tim as you can

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.340 
double-a batteries but Tim as you can
see<00:03:13.190> just<00:03:14.630> yeah<00:03:15.630> as<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:15.930> see<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
see just yeah as you can see I just

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.560 
see just yeah as you can see I just
wasted<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.250> money<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.790> got<00:03:17.940> myself<00:03:18.090> some

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
wasted my money and I got myself some

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.960 
wasted my money and I got myself some
pointless<00:03:19.110> batteries<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.950> are<00:03:19.980> absolutely

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
pointless batteries that are absolutely

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.690 
pointless batteries that are absolutely
useless<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.080> now<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:23.010> doesn't<00:03:23.280> work<00:03:23.400> at<00:03:23.580> all

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
useless and now it doesn't work at all

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.440 
useless and now it doesn't work at all
so<00:03:24.000> thank<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.200> very<00:03:25.799> much<00:03:26.070> ever<00:03:26.670> ready<00:03:27.060> you

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
that supposed to have 36 batteries in it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.199 
that supposed to have 36 batteries in it
but<00:03:46.410> obviously<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:47.040> was<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.459> cheaper<00:03:47.790> gate<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.150> i

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
but obviously I was a cheaper gate and i

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.720 
but obviously I was a cheaper gate and i
bought<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.480> crap<00:03:48.690> one<00:03:50.299> wrap<00:03:51.530> balls<00:03:52.730> stupid
