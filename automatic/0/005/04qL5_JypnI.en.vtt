okay so how do I use this looper very
easy<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:34.160> program<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.940> just<00:02:35.180> come<00:02:35.420> here

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
easy to program it you just come here

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.809 
easy to program it you just come here
and<00:02:36.370> press<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.520> hold<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.120> mode<00:02:38.420> switch<00:02:39.819> okay

unique<00:03:14.239> feature<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.620> looper<00:03:16.159> has

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
unique feature that this looper has

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.690 
unique feature that this looper has
which<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.860> LED<00:03:19.400> indication<00:03:20.299> system<00:03:21.700> this

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
which is the LED indication system this

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.670 
which is the LED indication system this
this<00:03:23.269> looper<00:03:23.599> for<00:03:23.780> example<00:03:24.170> you're<00:03:24.379> doing

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
this looper for example you're doing

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.399 
this looper for example you're doing
preset<00:03:25.189> mode<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.670> then<00:03:26.540> let's<00:03:26.989> say<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:27.230> are

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
preset mode and then let's say you are

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.619 
preset mode and then let's say you are
in<00:03:27.590> prison<00:03:27.769> number<00:03:28.069> one<00:03:28.400> presets<00:03:29.120> number<00:03:29.450> one

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
in prison number one presets number one

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.569 
in prison number one presets number one
and<00:03:29.870> how<00:03:30.500> do<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.620> know<00:03:30.680> which<00:03:30.950> pedals<00:03:31.310> are<00:03:31.400> on

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
and how do you know which pedals are on

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.110 
and how do you know which pedals are on
well<00:03:32.269> if<00:03:32.629> you<00:03:33.170> see<00:03:33.379> these<00:03:33.560> LED<00:03:34.310> blinking<00:03:34.760> here

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
well if you see these LED blinking here

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.490 
well if you see these LED blinking here
and<00:03:35.329> it's<00:03:35.450> blinking<00:03:35.840> fast

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
and it's blinking fast

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.680 
and it's blinking fast
it<00:03:36.590> means<00:03:36.829> it's<00:03:37.099> telling<00:03:37.909> you<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.239> this

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
it means it's telling you that this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.589 
it means it's telling you that this
preset<00:03:39.319> is<00:03:39.440> on<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.950> this<00:03:40.129> loop<00:03:40.549> is<00:03:40.760> also<00:03:41.239> on<00:03:41.390> in

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
preset is on and this loop is also on in

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.849 
preset is on and this loop is also on in
this<00:03:41.720> loop<00:03:41.959> we<00:03:42.140> have<00:03:42.489> have<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.519> run<00:03:43.849> okay<00:03:44.859> let's

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
this loop we have have a run okay let's

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.470 
this loop we have have a run okay let's
say<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.069> want<00:03:46.280> go<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.400> preset<00:03:46.819> number<00:03:47.060> two

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
say I want go to preset number two

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.830 
say I want go to preset number two
okay<00:03:48.290> prison<00:03:48.709> number<00:03:48.799> two<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:50.450> light<00:03:50.690> is

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
okay prison number two that light is

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.449 
okay prison number two that light is
blinking<00:03:51.019> fast<00:03:51.500> again<00:03:51.859> so<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.159> telling<00:03:52.310> you

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
blinking fast again so it's telling you

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.030 
blinking fast again so it's telling you
that<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:53.120> are<00:03:53.150> on<00:03:53.690> preset<00:03:54.319> number<00:03:54.409> two<00:03:54.769> and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
that you are on preset number two and

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.780 
that you are on preset number two and
this<00:03:55.940> loop<00:03:56.269> it's<00:03:56.659> also<00:03:56.870> on<00:03:57.200> which<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.950> j-kwon

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
this loop it's also on which is a j-kwon

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.729 
this loop it's also on which is a j-kwon
high<00:03:59.060> overdrive<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.109> a<00:04:00.290> delay<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:03.200> let's<00:04:03.470> say

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
high overdrive and a delay and let's say

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.430 
high overdrive and a delay and let's say
you<00:04:03.799> want<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.549> go<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.730> prison<00:04:04.940> number<00:04:05.150> four<00:04:05.599> now

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
you want to go to prison number four now

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.490 
you want to go to prison number four now
prison<00:04:06.859> number<00:04:07.099> four<00:04:07.310> has<00:04:07.579> look<00:04:08.329> to<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.230> loop

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
prison number four has look to and loop

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.879 
prison number four has look to and loop
three<00:04:10.220> on<00:04:10.489> but<00:04:11.000> look<00:04:11.180> for<00:04:11.569> is<00:04:11.840> not<00:04:11.870> on<00:04:12.230> that's

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
three on but look for is not on that's

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.439 
three on but look for is not on that's
why<00:04:13.159> the<00:04:13.220> light<00:04:13.819> it's<00:04:14.180> blinking<00:04:14.750> slow<00:04:15.400> okay

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
why the light it's blinking slow okay

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.199 
why the light it's blinking slow okay
it's<00:04:17.449> on<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.560> preset<00:04:19.489> number<00:04:19.820> four

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
it's on you that the preset number four

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.600 
it's on you that the preset number four
it's<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:21.169> but<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.500> loop<00:04:21.650> number<00:04:21.799> phone<00:04:22.099> is<00:04:22.250> not

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
it's on but the loop number phone is not

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.260 
it's on but the loop number phone is not
on<00:04:22.910> that's<00:04:23.240> why<00:04:23.479> it's<00:04:23.840> blinking<00:04:24.260> slow

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
