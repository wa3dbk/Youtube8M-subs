00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.640
 were presented in the parking lot 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 Profit here is the market is down 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.509
 Windows 7 can also be installed via usb-sticks 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.340
 This is especially important if, for example, notebooks are not the woman 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.739
 own the drives 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.059
 what preparations they have to make for them shows the author in this 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.059
 Video 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.409
 however, give also the possibility 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.720
 that are the inflation about a usb-stick perform 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.710
 This has several advantages, one is the access to a usb-stick 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.040
 sometimes much faster than the dvd drive 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.060
 on the other hand, in some computers, for example, on netbooks, although enough 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.699
 strong hardware installed 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.359
 as can operate for Windows 7 but they do not have a CD or DVD DrÃ¤ger on 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.400
 the calculator 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.960
 I see that Windows 7 can install via a usb-stick 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.129
 you need to prepare the stick accordingly you need it 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.649
 first an empty usb stick over it at least two cool five 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.110
 Gigabyte of memory has better four gigabytes of memory 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 and of course they need those for those like Windows 7 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.490
 divided this 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.980
 then you can either 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.649
 Copy to a hard disk 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.570
 and then prepare the corresponding usb-stick accordingly 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.560
 or they copy the appropriate data 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.760
 from the CD to the usb-stick 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.799
 the first step in this action is 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.890
 that you prepare the usb-stick accordingly 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.850
 Open Field 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.220
 new command line 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.259
 namely the demolition Trader mode 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.079
 To do this, right-click on the command prompt 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.610
 want to run as an administrator 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 because you sure that the usb-stick 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 Computer is connected 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.020
 then start the command line sound for managing 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.710
 Hard disk flipchart 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.920
 This sound not all installed loudly actually wanted her computer 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.150
 Are available 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.020
 then give the command light is on and all connected 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.869
 Devices to let ads 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.999
 if usb-stick they recognize relatively quickly at the small size in 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.670
 this case 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.879
 3 command retirees nine gigabytes 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.090
 Next will see casting media for editing out with 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.949
 Select Dec and the number this usb-stick has with you 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.399
 there it grows unless it is Kiel 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.549
 that means the data carrier vip-Bereich nods and completely deleted 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.259
 is subsequently created with Cream Sudden Primary 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.040
 a new primary partition on the disk 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.949
 So that Windows 7 can land, such a coalition is necessary 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.949
 successfully create the paddling tour of the office you are actively using it 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.509
 Ground also an active partition is used 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.999
 then format this pulls 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.299
 you can 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.629
 for usb-sticks quite fat32 now use for booting and installing 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.569
 for Windows 7 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.659
 Not necessarily intec is necessary with Quick being a quick formatting 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.909
 carried out 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.329
 After the formatting finished you can join as a club a duel on ice 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.069
 To assign letters 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.449
 and that does not cover plug in 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.469
 you can now leave Dispatch 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.250
 the next step is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.470
 that they check which drive letter is this now 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.110
 usb-stick assigned in this case drive letter corp 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.090
 subsequently navigate pulls 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.060
 on the installation 10 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.510
 more of Windows 7 in the directory 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.690
 I have to 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.869
 the delegates 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 copied to my hard drive with me 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.029
 they can if they can 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.249
 in the command line enter CD and the first two letters with turbocharger 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.899
 switch between directories and so quickly to the 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.489
 Change directories 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.340
 I have the content here since Windows 7 like the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.509
 Change to the directory Brut 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.779
 in this directory is an executable file with which I but 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.479
 Sector of Windows 7 transferred to the usb-stick I use the command 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.389
 Utrecht 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.499
 the option NP 6 0 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.459
 and then the drive letter of the usb-stick in 

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:29.330
 In this case approx 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.180
 subsequently transfers 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.319
 Windows 7 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.669
 automatically 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.919
 necessary files on the usb-stick 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.919
 in the Laufer k 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.729
 The next step, on the other hand, is to keep the entire contents of Windows 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.439
 7 the WG 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.550
 on casting disk 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.219
 transfer 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.030
 this means 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.410
 sure if either the DVD runtime or if they have the content on the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.300
 If you have copied hard disk you can also copy the action over it 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.030
 Start hard drive is important we must complete the recorded 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.089
 front 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:10.849
 Windows 7 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.479
 with the Explorer 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.479
 transferred to the usb-stick 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.180
 after copying the files 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.860
 The next step is that in the appropriate computer via USB 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.650
 but they have to 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.450
 in the Pius of the computer also set the option that the examiner went over 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.449
 USB work that could not all computers 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.639
 For some rights, they have to start a special but mine 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.460
 that is designed to over a shortcut that you at the start of the 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.349
 Calculator find 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.410
 on other machines configure for the setting and the BIOS 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.620
 important is that they are at all 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.400
 in the Lord Mayor or USB in the boat 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.830
 in this direction any BIOS looking for the computer on the usb-stick 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.830
 looking for a corresponding media 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.680
 after having started the book if he has 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:04.490
 can many 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.659
 select the usb-stick for the pooth process 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.900
 4 USB stick is then launched the protector 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.560
 and then through the copied files, the Windows 7 installation 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.150
 But make sure that not all USB received a computer to the ground 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.990
 are suitable 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.930
 sometimes work had called for 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.100
 Inputs not to try it then directly at a rear entrance 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.350
 also the applications 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.139
 to a usb hub does not always work 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.169
 correct is that the usb-stick is recognized by the computer and then 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.050
 Also works booting over the USB stick and you can use Windows 7 without 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.539
 Install DVD disc
