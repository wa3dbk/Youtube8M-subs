as<00:01:41.939> awesome<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.649> but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
as awesome as you think it would be but

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
as awesome as you think it would be but
in<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.460> future<00:01:44.490> hopefully<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.329> an

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
in the future hopefully to have an

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
in the future hopefully to have an
update<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.070> guys<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.430> was

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
update for it so guys like I was

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.010 
update for it so guys like I was
mentioning<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:48.030> basically<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
mentioning can basically use the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.319 
mentioning can basically use the
left-mouse<00:01:49.560> 1<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.040> rain<00:01:50.280> fire<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:50.880> above<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
left-mouse 1 to rain fire from above and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
left-mouse 1 to rain fire from above and
completely<00:01:51.689> decimate<00:01:52.079> everyone<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.799> your

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
completely decimate everyone in your

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219 
completely decimate everyone in your
path<00:01:53.159> oh<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.640> gosh<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> best

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
path oh my gosh that was like the best

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
path oh my gosh that was like the best
feature<00:01:55.649> ever<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.460> dumb<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.119> switch<00:01:57.390> cameras

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
feature ever and dumb to switch cameras

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.630 
feature ever and dumb to switch cameras
actually<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.829> ac-130<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
actually when you're in your ac-130 you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
actually when you're in your ac-130 you
could<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.850> ahead<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.840> hit<00:02:01.049> tier<00:02:01.350> 2

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
could go ahead and I'm hit tier 2

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
could go ahead and I'm hit tier 2
keyboard<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> switch<00:02:02.100> sides<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:03.090> probably

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
keyboard to switch sides it's probably

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.569 
keyboard to switch sides it's probably
not<00:02:03.719> even<00:02:03.990> better<00:02:04.380> than<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> side<00:02:05.070> bar<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.340> but

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
not even better than the side bar on but

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.859 
not even better than the side bar on but
sometimes<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.329> actually<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.719> good

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
sometimes it's actually really good

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.240 
sometimes it's actually really good
because<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.290> know<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> ac-130

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
because you know the ac-130

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440 
because you know the ac-130
like<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> mentioned<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.060> no<00:02:09.179> control

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
like I mentioned you have no control

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.400 
like I mentioned you have no control
over<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.020> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.289> turns<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.950> twist

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
over it so it kind of turns and twist

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
over it so it kind of turns and twist
as<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.680> go<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:12.790> one<00:02:12.940> thing<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.120> mention<00:02:13.270> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
as you go now one thing to mention is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.690 
as you go now one thing to mention is
that<00:02:13.510> ac-130<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.410> actually<00:02:14.890> indestructible

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that ac-130 is actually indestructible

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.670 
that ac-130 is actually indestructible
so<00:02:16.090> even<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.510> hits<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.720> mountain<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.380> will

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
so even if it hits a mountain it will

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.620 
so even if it hits a mountain it will
not<00:02:17.950> blow<00:02:18.190> up<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.640> does<00:02:18.820> adjust<00:02:19.420> its

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
not blow up and it does adjust its

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.870 
not blow up and it does adjust its
elevation<00:02:19.960> accordingly<00:02:20.680> all<00:02:21.580> right<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.790> it's

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
elevation accordingly all right so it's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.980 
elevation accordingly all right so it's
going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> blow<00:02:22.240> up<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.330> car<00:02:22.630> oh<00:02:22.660> my<00:02:22.840> gosh

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
going to blow up that car oh my gosh

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.840 
going to blow up that car oh my gosh
check<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> out<00:02:23.470> he<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.830> completely<00:02:24.400> dead<00:02:24.640> now

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
check it out he is completely dead now

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.990 
check it out he is completely dead now
huh<00:02:25.540> oh<00:02:25.570> gosh<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.650> bad<00:02:27.490> we're

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
huh oh gosh that is so bad we're

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.400 
huh oh gosh that is so bad we're
completely<00:02:28.390> killing<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.720> some<00:02:28.900> people<00:02:29.170> here

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
completely killing in some people here

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.080 
completely killing in some people here
now<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.040> also<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.460> three<00:02:30.700> different<00:02:31.000> weapons

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
now we also have three different weapons

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.110 
now we also have three different weapons
us<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.080> c-130<00:02:32.680> we<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:33.010> got<00:02:33.130> 105

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
us this is a c-130 we have got 105

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.660 
us this is a c-130 we have got 105
millimeter<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:35.080> 40<00:02:35.410> millimeter<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.100> 25

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
millimeter the 40 millimeter and a 25

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910 
millimeter the 40 millimeter and a 25
now<00:02:37.390> if<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.570> guys<00:02:37.660> did<00:02:37.930> not<00:02:37.960> notice<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.620> far

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
now if you guys did not notice so far

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.430 
now if you guys did not notice so far
this<00:02:39.340> ac-130<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.180> basically<00:02:40.630> based<00:02:41.050> off<00:02:41.290> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
this ac-130 is basically based off the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.310 
this ac-130 is basically based off the
one<00:02:41.650> from<00:02:42.250> mw2<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.930> does<00:02:44.050> have<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.230> same

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
one from mw2 and it does have the same

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.470 
one from mw2 and it does have the same
sound<00:02:44.650> effects<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.820> switch<00:02:46.000> your<00:02:46.150> weapons

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
sound effects so to switch your weapons

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.450 
sound effects so to switch your weapons
you<00:02:46.540> basically<00:02:46.870> hit<00:02:47.080> e<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.740> your<00:02:47.770> keyboard<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
you basically hit e on your keyboard and

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.430 
you basically hit e on your keyboard and
you<00:02:49.000> could<00:02:49.150> switch<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.420> our<00:02:49.750> 40<00:02:50.080> millimeter

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
you could switch to our 40 millimeter

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.970 
you could switch to our 40 millimeter
which<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> much<00:02:51.910> higher<00:02:52.540> kind<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.500> fire<00:02:53.710> rate

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
which is a much higher kind of fire rate

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.160 
which is a much higher kind of fire rate
but<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.520> does<00:02:54.880> have<00:02:55.030> smaller<00:02:55.270> explosions<00:02:55.570> but

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
but it does have smaller explosions but

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.780 
but it does have smaller explosions but
the<00:02:56.260> explosion<00:02:56.620> still<00:02:57.070> does<00:02:57.250> its<00:02:57.400> job<00:02:57.430> checked

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
the explosion still does its job checked

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.790 
the explosion still does its job checked
out<00:02:57.880> guys<00:02:58.150> we're<00:02:58.570> completely<00:02:58.990> decimating

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
out guys we're completely decimating

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.070 
out guys we're completely decimating
that<00:02:59.950> car<00:03:00.190> down<00:03:00.400> there<00:03:00.640> not<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.630> mention<00:03:01.780> we

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
that car down there not to mention we

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.380 
that car down there not to mention we
have<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.230> huge<00:03:02.680> range<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.210> addition

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
have a huge range on it but in addition

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.210 
have a huge range on it but in addition
to<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:04.870> also<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:05.470> gravity<00:03:05.980> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
to that we also have like gravity and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.100 
to that we also have like gravity and
bullet<00:03:06.640> drop<00:03:06.880> meaning<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.390> if<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.630> shoot<00:03:07.870> like

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
bullet drop meaning that if I shoot like

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.030 
bullet drop meaning that if I shoot like
all<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.350> way<00:03:08.410> out<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.710> can<00:03:08.860> see<00:03:09.010> that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
all the way out there you can see that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.760 
all the way out there you can see that
lands<00:03:09.610> like<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.000> lot<00:03:10.270> closer<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.870> me<00:03:11.140> than<00:03:11.290> you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
lands like a lot closer to me than you

the<00:03:57.489> system<00:03:57.790> worked<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.180> well<00:03:58.360> sometimes<00:03:58.660> it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the system worked that well sometimes it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.720 
the system worked that well sometimes it
works<00:03:59.080> but<00:03:59.320> basically<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.980> puts<00:04:00.489> down<00:04:00.610> a

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
works but basically it puts down a

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.400 
works but basically it puts down a
stationary<00:04:01.270> camera<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.780> looks<00:04:01.959> at<00:04:02.200> your

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
stationary camera that looks at your

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.979 
stationary camera that looks at your
ac-130<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.640> random<00:04:03.940> location<00:04:04.360> in<00:04:04.540> your<00:04:04.600> map

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
ac-130 and a random location in your map

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.170 
ac-130 and a random location in your map
but<00:04:05.739> since<00:04:05.980> we're<00:04:06.160> like<00:04:06.280> at<00:04:06.430> an<00:04:06.520> elevated<00:04:06.880> peak

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
but since we're like at an elevated peak

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.300 
but since we're like at an elevated peak
it's<00:04:07.420> putting<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.840> camera<00:04:08.230> on<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.770> opposite

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
it's putting the camera on the opposite

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.740 
it's putting the camera on the opposite
side<00:04:09.520> of<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.820> mountain<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.120> as<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.480> can<00:04:10.570> see

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
side of the mountain so as you can see

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.690 
side of the mountain so as you can see
when<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:11.230> hit<00:04:11.290> our<00:04:11.530> there<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.100> doesn't<00:04:12.550> even

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
when we hit our there and doesn't even

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.670 
when we hit our there and doesn't even
show<00:04:13.030> anything<00:04:13.300> but<00:04:14.110> if<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:14.410> you're<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
show anything but if like you're in the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.050 
show anything but if like you're in the
city<00:04:14.830> or<00:04:14.950> something<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.459> have<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.610> chance<00:04:15.910> of

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
city or something you have a chance of

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.330 
city or something you have a chance of
possibly<00:04:16.510> seeing<00:04:16.870> your<00:04:17.440> ac-130<00:04:18.010> from<00:04:18.220> the

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
possibly seeing your ac-130 from the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.430 
possibly seeing your ac-130 from the
ground<00:04:18.580> and<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.450> keep<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.870> keep<00:04:19.960> hitting<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
ground and I keep I keep hitting the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.479 
ground and I keep I keep hitting the
button<00:04:20.680> because<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:20.950> know<00:04:21.070> sometimes<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
button because you know sometimes the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.870 
button because you know sometimes the
camera<00:04:21.729> changes<00:04:22.060> as<00:04:22.180> we<00:04:22.300> travel<00:04:23.020> along<00:04:23.110> in

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
camera changes as we travel along in

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.390 
camera changes as we travel along in
now<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> night<00:04:25.200> vision<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.100> thermal

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
now the night vision and the thermal

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.920 
now the night vision and the thermal
vision<00:04:26.580> are<00:04:26.820> pretty<00:04:27.120> much<00:04:27.240> useless<00:04:27.510> because<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
vision are pretty much useless because I

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.440 
vision are pretty much useless because I
mostly<00:04:28.350> play<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.890> daytime<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.550> considering
