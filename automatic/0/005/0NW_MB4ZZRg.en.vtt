00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.440
 about to know a 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.569
 and vibrating of the camelids 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.120
 South American to start here I have 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.910
 The fiber of the vicuÃ±a can be seen in 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.039
 the first gigantography this second 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 smoother the finer the more expensive to 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.480
 world-wide scored matches already 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.009
 currently no garments are being made 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.170
 with this fiber since the animal is 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.269
 undertaken description and is protected 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.089
 by the Peruvian government and only one 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:33.760
 Scarf is between $ 700 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:36.410
 approximately it is very expensive that you have 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.660
 that killing is not that one lives 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.660
 in very high places and it is difficult 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.650
 here I have the first of the law of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.250
 alpacas we have 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.250
 the pac is unique 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.090
 baby alpaca is not named because the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 animal be small baby if it is not the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 first cut 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.390
 the first 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.159
 good 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.409
 here I have the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.930
 here is the chain 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.170
 s 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170
 yes 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 different 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.610
 ah 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.890
 the ink does not flame life the flame 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.710
 after no animal load its fibers 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.420
 very rough that we practice a lot 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 they can be us we know we do not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.920
 no type of garment only serves to seem 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.510
 carpets for floors for prey but in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.790
 other places combine it and sell it 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.780
 as ipad or as I saw being by the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.780
 natural colors that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 well I will teach you to know 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.600
 by cheating when they want to acquire 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.450
 a garment here I have a garment 100 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.130
 synthetic in the streets in markets 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 handcrafted or they also drive 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.180
 bundeswehr not grow as the calculation what 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.440
 that sellers do is use that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.200
 brush to load the garment and get 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.120
 a softness apparent on the outside but for 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.980
 inside the garment is coarse and rough 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.320
 you will recognize her because this 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 garment has no touch weight is like 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.300
 hot and the colors are very shiny 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.070
 As you can see, it pays for the colors 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.280
 natural and the designs that come 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.709
 because the consistency is 80% acrylic and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.990
 20% flame fiber you are going to 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.300
 recognize by the tissue is very loose 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.190
 in the first second wash I know who is 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.070
 throw very easily 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.500
 and you will not look good does not want 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.520
 weight they need brushing for 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.620
 smoothness 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.980
 and until then confused because the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.980
 person 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.550
 here I have a full that is of better 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.350
 quality is 100 adult alpaca the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.870
 temperature is important for the 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.940
 recognize is cold in soft periods 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.940
 both sides and it is already heavy 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.550
 and this is the best quality unlearn 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.890
 100% baby alpaca will not play very 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.930
 filial as much as wet but the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.550
 quality of this garment is that it suits 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.840
 to body heat you can be 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.620
 with a piece of clothing I have fun 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.720
 any place and in any 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.640
 temperature apart that is like 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.920
 waterproof by the lanolin that has 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.920
 this silky garment on both sides 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.710
 yes 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.030
 and this garment is also 100% baby 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.650
 alpaca but we call it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.810
 garment because we use 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.330
 pigment of 100 plant vegetable 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.340
 as you can see flowers 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.380
 roots insects minerals to give him the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.650
 color to our garment I do not know if they know 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.180
 the cochineal is a small insect that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.919
 lives on campus between red and pink 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:33.210
 and we get the yellow colors and from 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.600
 various leaves the green colors the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.600
 buttons 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:44.930
 and this is what a 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.210
 garment of 100 baby alpaca have it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.820
 wash by hand with cold water shampoo 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.800
 hair to keep them soft and 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.490
 a flat surface is shortly and the 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 another option is washing the sena 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.630
 thank you for your attention so that you 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.569
 can observe our prey 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.569
 we also have 950 silver jewelry 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.629
