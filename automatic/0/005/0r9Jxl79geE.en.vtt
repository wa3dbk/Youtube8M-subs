00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.330
 at dinner and restorer of paintings installed in the quiet of the summit held 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.519

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.089
 christie 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.060
 he considers that the technical situation 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.239
 right here 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.390
 a freeze of capital endowment of regrets so it is private individuals 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.030
 mel gibson 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030
 commanders creating small 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.690
 17th 17th league copy in general the portrait in fact 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.700
 but since that means that our elders 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.200
 I am here but the break is an indic the back is 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.130
 after that I make them a snow 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.090
 the cued 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.160
 david oliver in nantes 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.790
 percent who taught us and so the mystery of the relationship of a photo 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 all the techniques used by the painters 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.510
 - what I liked doing this suspicion that passion creation 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.270
 I wanted to find a job of saihi 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.750
 mike was getting closer in the table climb what's really what he's getting 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 was getting closer to matte understand how 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.190
 the tables 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.990
 in the us after paris for 153 was mounted on a chassis 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.939
 the prices of the different preparations before depicting 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.429
 how to find out how 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.649
 so we make the mixes it belongs to one of the worst 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.280
 moments like that we sit down key support coming 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.990
 11% 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.850
 the vine and a hit and then you have a talent the table itself your age 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 you have there is only the last 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.480
 Pagenaud 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.670
 we follow treatments 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.990
 Bernanke you have to go away you have to go back to the visibility and the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.840
 readability of the table 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.610
 so in the end 6 to 1 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630
 strides of schirmeck 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.479
 it's the same for everyone is to find a bonus of 600 meters 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.979
 This is a school for the deaf in Wisconsin and is already positioning 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.759
 a few years later by a time of preparation I learned the copy in 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:31.579
 more 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.779
 of chemistry and art history the copy of the great 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.559
 Rome - per cubic meter 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:41.689
 Perquis 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:46.449
 there is actually a mayor before so it's up to all the students 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.490
 to know 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.670
 colors 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.670
 to understand the colors first round the light 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.170
 - after that compared to 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.780
 the painter has retreated as a technique and as a pigment link with this breed as 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.739
 support 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.870
 for after working the different segments it adapts necessarily the same 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.169
 than with what we analyzed before 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.779
 it does not sound like such a concentration that encourages you all and 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.569
 also appreciate 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 the initial text 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.070
 we maintain the most of this world 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.149
 then in stages 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:29.029
 the design office pointed out to discover his creations and view on this site since 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.119
