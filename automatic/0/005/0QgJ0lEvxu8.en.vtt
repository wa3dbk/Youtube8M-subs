00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
interesting memory for me the reason I'm

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.770 
interesting memory for me the reason I'm
shooting<00:02:25.020> HDR<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.880> several<00:02:27.750> reasons

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
actually one out of necessity you cannot

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.479 
actually one out of necessity you cannot
get<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.550> kind<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:33.090> clear<00:02:33.780> images<00:02:34.489> inside

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
get the kind of clear images inside

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.060
