grind<00:01:51.560> excellent<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.740> slicing<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.420> got

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
grind excellent for slicing and it's got

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.980 
grind excellent for slicing and it's got
a<00:01:54.689> an<00:01:55.110> adequately<00:01:56.070> thick<00:01:56.399> tip<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.939> too<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
a an adequately thick tip there too you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.539 
a an adequately thick tip there too you
know<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.619> designed<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.009> penetration

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
know not really designed for penetration

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.050 
know not really designed for penetration
but<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.360> pinch<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.960> could<00:02:01.140> work<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:02.060> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
but in a pinch this could work as you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.469 
but in a pinch this could work as you
know<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.710> adequate<00:02:04.979> tip<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
know it's got got adequate tip there so

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.999 
know it's got got adequate tip there so
for<00:02:06.750> most<00:02:06.840> tasks<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:08.520> handle<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.060> made<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
for most tasks the handle is made of

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.080 
for most tasks the handle is made of

this<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.969> of<00:02:15.120> course<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.510> sage<00:02:15.749> one<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:16.469> this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
this is of course the sage one so this

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.709 
this is of course the sage one so this
has<00:02:17.040> got<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.280> hand<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.730> carbon<00:02:18.120> fiber<00:02:18.359> handle

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719

to detail it's been meticulously drilled
out<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:34.139> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.500> use<00:02:34.829> three<00:02:35.129> or<00:02:35.250> four

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519

well it's starting to show a little bit
aware<00:04:43.800> but<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.789> finish<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.360> actually<00:04:45.960> very

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169

good<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.770> think<00:04:46.800> it'll<00:04:47.159> stay<00:04:47.430> attractive

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849

this is hardened steel this is not like

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.089 
this is hardened steel this is not like

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
course we've got a nice spider hole and

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.620 
course we've got a nice spider hole and
it's<00:05:08.280> not<00:05:08.460> blocked<00:05:08.759> by<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.030> handle<00:05:09.389> at<00:05:09.509> all

and very easy to get at and very smooth
very<00:05:12.599> smooth<00:05:13.440> opening<00:05:13.860> actually<00:05:14.610> when<00:05:14.729> I

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
very smooth opening actually when I

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.100 
very smooth opening actually when I
first<00:05:14.970> got<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.360> knife<00:05:15.569> it<00:05:15.750> was<00:05:15.780> kind<00:05:16.050> of

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
first got this knife it was kind of

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.670 
first got this knife it was kind of
stiff<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:17.120> took<00:05:18.120> some<00:05:18.330> real<00:05:18.569> work<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.139> to

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
stiff and took some real work to to

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.040 
stiff and took some real work to to
break<00:05:19.889> it<00:05:20.039> in<00:05:20.159> and<00:05:20.419> it's<00:05:21.419> just<00:05:21.780> been<00:05:21.900> getting

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
break it in and it's just been getting

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.480 
break it in and it's just been getting
better<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.620> better<00:05:22.800> I've<00:05:23.069> had<00:05:23.250> this<00:05:23.430> for

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
better and better I've had this for

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.379 
better and better I've had this for
probably<00:05:23.789> eight<00:05:24.750> months<00:05:24.990> now<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:26.180> it's<00:05:27.180> just

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
probably eight months now and it's just

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.140 
probably eight months now and it's just
getting<00:05:27.509> easier<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.199> deploy<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:29.150> smoother

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
getting easier to deploy and smoother

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.350 
getting easier to deploy and smoother
and<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:31.650> know<00:05:31.770> not<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:32.159> smoothest<00:05:32.460> knife<00:05:32.909> but

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
and you know not the smoothest knife but

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.540 
and you know not the smoothest knife but
i<00:05:33.599> think<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.319> deployment<00:05:34.800> is<00:05:34.889> is<00:05:35.190> actually

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
i think the deployment is is actually

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.939 
i think the deployment is is actually
very<00:05:35.580> smooth<00:05:36.120> especially<00:05:36.840> having<00:05:37.440> owned<00:05:37.770> it

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
very smooth especially having owned it

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.230 
very smooth especially having owned it
and<00:05:38.039> just<00:05:38.400> letting<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:38.699> break<00:05:38.880> in<00:05:39.090> it

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
and just letting it break in it

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.270 
and just letting it break in it
definitely<00:05:39.840> has<00:05:39.930> a<00:05:39.960> break-in<00:05:40.259> period<00:05:40.560> at

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
definitely has a break-in period at

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.120 
definitely has a break-in period at
least<00:05:41.460> with<00:05:41.639> mine<00:05:41.880> but<00:05:42.780> if<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:43.710> worth<00:05:43.919> the

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
least with mine but if it's worth the

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.879 
least with mine but if it's worth the
