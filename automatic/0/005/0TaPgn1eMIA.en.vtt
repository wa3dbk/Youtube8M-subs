00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.910
 yourself inspiration here is eva for 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.010
 you and i want you in this video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.670
 something with the rainbow room again 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.320
 show with the master studio that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.030
 is my first video studio around 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.250
 That's why I show you in this video 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.010
 only a little bit basics 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 I use the long technology for this 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.949
 splint your finger logo and you need 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 as I said the rail and me 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.579
 have here ever over the fingers around 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 a rubber over it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.100
 I'll show you how to do that first 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360
 rail here there are to this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.570
 go on it 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.899
 for that, the rail is once in the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 middle of the film from below 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.370
 and here is a little one so small 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.920
 elevation the velcro you lift once 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 in there and then you get with the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.629
 the other side also with the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 elevation and turns the whole thing so pure 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.170
 that they have one on both sides 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.320
 has overlap and the rail in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.770
 the middle is basically completely 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770
 easy 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.310
 with a bit of back and forth 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.980
 and you tried it a bit 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.620
 very fast in it looks like the whole 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.160
 land out can be up and down 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.960
 push and I'll show you how to do that 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.220
 all the green pink you do 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.890
 Of course, other colors 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.550
 use or a completely different pattern 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.380
 do 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.090
 I just show you mine 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.440
 basics engineering and how to do the whole 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.830
 then in the hair 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.500
 I continue with pink I give up 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:54.490
 the same pins on and then I pay 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.520
 Founder I'm simple 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.040
 eininger course that goes on 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.940
 easiest and fastest I do 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.940
 green pink 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.330
 always work alternately 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.100
 These are the rubbers in the set 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 was 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.320
 I also have an unboxing video to that 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 set in the channel 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.430
 if you're in for the set 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 interested in seeing the whole set once 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.750
 I want everything that is there and mine too 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.650
 look in the instructions for the book 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.290
 throw the state over and I want to throw 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.510
 Just live here in this pattern 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.640
 a little further so i have here now 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.840
 a few inches succeeded and me 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.200
 I have the doll's head here 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.709
 prepared and take the final rubber 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.260
 I now off and give it to the other 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.570
 side of the game so the pen in the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.430
 middle over the lung rail and that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.640
 I also pick the second one and I would give it too 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.500
 on the eu if the bottom so that 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.240
 All this now I just have 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.770
 a few inches of cabbage and I have 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.730
 not enough now tells the figure 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.670
 music used so 34 centimeters 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.880
 just let the whole looks like this 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.980
 so push back and forth and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.980
 Now it goes on with the doll's head 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.900
 and the needle with this needle I'll get 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.980
 me now a strand of hair that is here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.980
 above had 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.580
 Here I go once through the pen 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.170
 so i put them right in the 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.720
 So pen can pull in the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:05.730
 machine then I get the strand 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.920
 and she once brings the streak here and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.920
 pull it completely through here 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.740
 and now i can do it here 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.740
 push graph 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.960
 so it's all up to the hair 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.889
 here closed by the two 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.080
 rubbers on the opposite 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.080
 side are each and up here 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.400
 so is the corresponding also the whole 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.270
 looks like this is the alm 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.060
 this is the simplest variant 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.150
 just a normal inner band looks like this 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.190
 the whole then so you can 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.380
 Of course, do a lot of them or 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.120
 it is considered a highlight that it 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.730
 now, as I said the easiest 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.620
 variant and in the next days and 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.450
 I will definitely ask you for more weeks 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.020
 show what you do with it 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.750
 can 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.670
 that is really diverse and 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.080
 with the material that the bite 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.000
 really beautiful things 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.170
 and if you liked it 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.580
 if you might also like that 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.630
 Let me try it all over 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.520
 just thumb up 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.440
 Of course I am always happy and 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.480
 if you have more mister flum ideas and 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.120
 often even more with the rainbow lumen and 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.530
 the lord in the studio have let us 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.610
 wake up from or if not yet 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.100
 Of course, we are happy about that 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.330
 you always have japhet too 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.950

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.770
 we of course also everywhere 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.270
 if you like the video very well 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.280
