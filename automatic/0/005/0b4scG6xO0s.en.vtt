knife grab the hair a little bit easier

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.490 
knife grab the hair a little bit easier

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
and it also keeps the static from

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.710 
and it also keeps the static from
building<00:01:23.800> up<00:01:23.920> as<00:01:24.040> you're<00:01:24.160> carting<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.550> out<00:01:24.730> and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
building up as you're carting it out and

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.840 
building up as you're carting it out and
they<00:01:26.170> should<00:01:26.650> actually<00:01:27.010> have<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.220> level<00:01:27.610> top

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
they should actually have a level top

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.940 
they should actually have a level top
line<00:01:28.120> so<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.540> can<00:01:28.660> see<00:01:28.960> where<00:01:29.110> she<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.320> because

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
line so you can see where she is because

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.380 
line so you can see where she is because
she's<00:01:30.100> got<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> lot<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.520> extra<00:01:30.820> bulk<00:01:31.090> she's<00:01:31.300> a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
she's got a lot of extra bulk she's a

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420 
she's got a lot of extra bulk she's a
little<00:01:31.510> bit<00:01:31.690> high<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:32.140> rear<00:01:32.350> hot<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.310> the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
little bit high in the rear hot in the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.630 
little bit high in the rear hot in the
rear<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.650> she's<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.400> a<00:01:36.430> look<00:01:36.580> a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
to strip this area out and help make

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.720 
to strip this area out and help make
this<00:01:54.760> lay<00:01:55.000> down<00:01:55.980> she<00:01:56.980> actually<00:01:57.100> wants<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.550> lay

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
this lay down she actually wants to lay

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.070 
this lay down she actually wants to lay
down<00:01:57.760> herself<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.180> but<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.450> can<00:02:01.480> see<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:01.960> by

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
down herself so but you can see just by

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.120 
down herself so but you can see just by
carving<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:02.590> out<00:02:03.120> and<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:05.080> give<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
carving this out and you give that the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.249 
carving this out and you give that the
coat<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.760> lay<00:02:06.909> really<00:02:07.120> flat<00:02:07.240> because<00:02:07.990> what

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
coat to lay really flat because what

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.359 
coat to lay really flat because what
we're<00:02:08.379> doing<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.619> we're<00:02:08.739> taking<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.069> bulk

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
we're doing is we're taking the bulk

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.949 
we're doing is we're taking the bulk
that's<00:02:09.580> underneath<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.269> causing<00:02:10.659> this<00:02:10.750> hair

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
that's underneath it's causing this hair

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.800 
that's underneath it's causing this hair
to<00:02:11.080> be<00:02:11.170> pushed<00:02:11.409> up<00:02:11.620> we're<00:02:12.280> removing<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.480> it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
to be pushed up we're removing it so it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.690 
to be pushed up we're removing it so it
allows<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.319> top<00:02:14.530> coat<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.920> lay<00:02:15.099> more

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
allows the top coat to lay more

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.770 
allows the top coat to lay more
naturally

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770 

you<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.710> also<00:02:19.920> do<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:21.240> pet<00:02:21.480> dogs

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
you can also do this to your pet dogs

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.650 
you can also do this to your pet dogs
that<00:02:22.020> have<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.920> tend<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.850> they<00:02:24.330> grow<00:02:24.630> out

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
that have that tend to get they grow out

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.450 
that have that tend to get they grow out
these<00:02:24.990> little<00:02:25.140> sporadic<00:02:25.800> hairs<00:02:26.040> here<00:02:26.340> and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
these little sporadic hairs here and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.510 
these little sporadic hairs here and
there<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> key<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.560> always<00:02:29.010> go<00:02:29.250> in

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
there so but the key is to always go in

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.090 
there so but the key is to always go in
the<00:02:29.550> direction<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> coat<00:02:30.450> grows<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.590> order

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the direction of the coat grows in order

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.880 
the direction of the coat grows in order
to<00:02:32.190> get<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.460> lay<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.910> way<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.650> think<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
to get it to lay that way I think that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340 
to get it to lay that way I think that
so<00:02:35.130> many<00:02:35.220> breeds<00:02:35.550> out<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.350> many
