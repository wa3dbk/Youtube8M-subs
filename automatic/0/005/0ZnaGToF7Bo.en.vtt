00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 
guys know what it does if both of them
are<00:02:19.430> out<00:02:19.490> then<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.660> can't<00:02:20.870> get<00:02:21.020> attacked

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290

essentially spirit reaper for stalling

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.470 
essentially spirit reaper for stalling
now<00:02:25.190> here's<00:02:25.430> something<00:02:25.640> different<00:02:26.060> three

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
now here's something different three

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.830 
now here's something different three
still<00:02:26.900> thirds<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.920> what<00:02:28.040> they<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.670> once<00:02:29.600> you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
still thirds so what they do is once you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.070 
still thirds so what they do is once you
flip<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.560> personally<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.630> opponent

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
flip it up personally then the opponent

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.140 
flip it up personally then the opponent
will<00:02:33.170> take<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> thousand<00:02:33.890> damage<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.940> top

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
will take a thousand damage and on top

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390 
will take a thousand damage and on top
of<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.350> then<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.530> flipped<00:02:36.920> back<00:02:37.130> face

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
of that it can then be flipped back face

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000 
of that it can then be flipped back face
down<00:02:37.700> again<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:39.290> know<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.680> fairly

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
down again so you know it's got fairly

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.890 
down again so you know it's got fairly
high<00:02:40.160> defense<00:02:40.459> 1,700<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:41.360> most<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.720> time

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
high defense 1,700 so most of the time

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.090 
high defense 1,700 so most of the time
this<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.110> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.560> in<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.680> field<00:02:42.890> for

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
this is going to be out in the field for

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.490 
this is going to be out in the field for
quite<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.459> while<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.930> case<00:02:45.140> someone<00:02:45.470> brings

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
