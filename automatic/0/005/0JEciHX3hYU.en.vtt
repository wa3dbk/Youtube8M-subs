nothing clockwise is the proper
direction<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:46.039> try<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> move<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:53.539> gonna

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
direction I try to move it was gonna

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.369 
direction I try to move it was gonna
happen

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.340 

Terra<00:00:58.379> clockwise<00:00:59.300> turns<00:01:01.699> it's<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.879> stiff

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
Terra clockwise turns it's bit stiff

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.760 
Terra clockwise turns it's bit stiff
stiff<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.040> turns<00:01:05.309> counterclockwise

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
stiff but it turns counterclockwise

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.200 
stiff but it turns counterclockwise
clockwise<00:01:08.689> proper<00:01:09.710> Gration<00:01:11.000> not<00:01:12.000> gonna

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
clockwise proper Gration not gonna

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:25.450 
clockwise proper Gration not gonna
happen

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.060 

so<00:01:26.460> what's<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> mean

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
so what's that mean

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
so what's that mean
it<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.340> turn<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.600> wrong<00:01:30.810> way

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
it will turn the wrong way

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
it will turn the wrong way
instead<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.780> turn<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> wrong<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
instead it will turn the wrong way the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.639 
instead it will turn the wrong way the
right<00:01:36.090> way<00:01:36.890> like<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.280> can't<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.229> starter

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
right way like I can't do it the starter

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
right way like I can't do it the starter
can<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> little<00:01:41.429> bit<00:01:43.909> I'm<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:44.970> sure<00:01:45.299> what

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
can do it a little bit I'm not sure what

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:58.690 
can do it a little bit I'm not sure what
that<00:01:45.509> means

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.490 

it's<00:01:59.700> almost<00:01:59.940> like<00:02:00.210> there's<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> bearing<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's almost like there's that bearing of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.330 
it's almost like there's that bearing of
some<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.400> jammed<00:02:02.970> from<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.340> wetter

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
some kind that's jammed from the wetter

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.610 
some kind that's jammed from the wetter
side<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.940> pinch<00:02:06.210> point<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.590> engines

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
side of you pinch point when the engines

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.969 
side of you pinch point when the engines
turning<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.490> proper<00:02:09.210> direction<00:02:09.240> I<00:02:09.979> don't

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
turning in the proper direction I don't

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.500 
turning in the proper direction I don't
know<00:02:11.280> something's<00:02:12.240> wrong<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.940> bad

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
know something's wrong it's not that bad

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.710 
know something's wrong it's not that bad
in<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.960> wrong<00:02:16.320> direction<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:17.310> mean<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:21.480> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
in the wrong direction I mean if that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.810 
in the wrong direction I mean if that
was<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.020> proper<00:02:22.410> direction<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:23.160> might<00:02:23.400> be

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
was the proper direction it might be

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.800 
was the proper direction it might be
loose<00:02:24.000> enough<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.390> start<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.330> proper

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
loose enough to start but the proper

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.740 
loose enough to start but the proper
rotation<00:02:28.350> direction<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:30.410> super<00:02:31.410> stiff
