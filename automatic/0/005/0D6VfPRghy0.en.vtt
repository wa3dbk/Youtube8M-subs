00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.259
 very good kids here we are a 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.000
 new video states I bring a tutorial 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.220
 super speed with any car 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.450
 in this case I have the leader and 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.190
 we have to do we also have to 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.190
 have a titan and we do the following 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.110
 we put a front wheel of the below 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.150
 of the wheels of the titan is worth so in this 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.220
 case it will burst what is the rim 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.990
 the wheel will be removed from the car and 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.190
 we will have a wheel less obviously not 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.290
 we can remove more because otherwise 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.420
 it would work and it's a clips that this does 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.790
 that you run a lot more than double 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 now you will see the times and everything and nothing 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.780
 more would that be we go with the times 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.370
 and first of all let's see the leader 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 normal as are your times for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.820
 buy them then with the leader without a wheel 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 front you 've already taught before 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 We are on the airstrip of the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.580
 airport airport below and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 is running time this is a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.660
 pretty normal time that I've seen by 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.519
 there that is normal when you see 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 a car what tonal half butt already 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.410
 stop and stays with this time we call 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.879
 for 17 seconds 18 and here we are going to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.879
 stop it in now it's worth 21 with 972 seconds 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.650
 it's worth 22 seconds almost and now we're going to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.880
 see the times of the defeated with him 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.560
 called like that so we have a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.030
 difference between the two and well let's 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.250
 there we are on the same track the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.940
 same calculations in seconds as you see 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 Bottom right 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.540
 we go for six seconds and it's 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.950
 impressive this is going very very fast already 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.680
 I say it by breaking the wheel that we have 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.450
 broken with the titan is a barbarous thing or 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.689
 be awesome you see that now 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 we hope and we are at 16 with 717 the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.799
 another one was 22 seconds east and 16 now 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.200
 let's make a race between the two 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.210
 we are positioned in the same place 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.619
 You see that starter I have to start 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.299
 has the or the boot of yours is very 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.710
 slow mine is very fast you know that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.049
 the address 10 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.640
 better than they start in this game and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.880
 how I saw you made a difference one 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.130
 amazing advantage that is it does not have no 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.680
 have an option to get ahead and nothing 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 that and the guy always goes to the maximum and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.979
 we see against a helicopter I do not 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.720
 I agree on how it is called 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.310
 up as always in all places 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 we go there against the helicopters 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.590
 he also wins as you see he is the same 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.020
 bati l removed the wheel and you see that you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.119
 I also take advantage of a helicopter is 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.740
 I did not believe it, I said good 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.869
 let's try to see if the advantage comes out 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300
 with the helicopter and that's how it gets the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.760
 same advantage more as you see now going to 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.610
 go towards or we go over mine and I take it 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 It lasted for more than three seconds he took 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.830
 that is impressive and then here against 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.330
 a private jet that this one deserves 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.459
 left to this advantage and I say I'm not going to 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.470
 leave an advantage to see how it works 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.959
 this you see that I'm getting closer as 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.360
 a beast like a brute towards him and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.090
 exceeded in nothing and he climbs upwards 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.250
 but still I continue I continue to follow 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.200
 surpassing him and he took advantage of that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.430
 I say awesome we went through the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.410
 next comparison this time 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.770
 we compare the against the diving 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.870
 frozen 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.280
 again broken as always and now 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.650
 we started the race as you see the andres 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.270
 is very fast as you have seen in the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.910
 previous and this buffer is one of the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.280
 faster helicopters it seems to me and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.990
 you see that I get the same advantage 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.420
 that all cars a little less 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.090
 but he took advantage of this car with 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.790
 the wheel is very little dirigible but yes 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.740
 very fast and the most expected comparison 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.810
 the have against the hunting of the newly fighter 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.630
 out of the military base we go there to 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.030
 see how about three if we go we start with 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.830
 a spectacular start these wins them 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.870
 nobody and the fighter stays behind to the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.850
 minimum is the fighter runs very much what 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.370
 you have seen prove it you run 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.960
 very much then nothing that can not with 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.830
 we can not even a fighter with 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.180
 we 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.100
 awesome I hope you liked it 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.990
 this video if it is like this, to like it 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.819
 please for the work that has cost me and 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.819
 see you in the next goodbye 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 Y 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.010
 and
