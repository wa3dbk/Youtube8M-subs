00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
Fighting Gravity I'm actually

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.119 
Fighting Gravity I'm actually
contracting<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> bicep<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.890> more

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
contracting the bicep the more

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
contracting the bicep the more
resistance<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.300> snake<00:00:57.629> arm

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
resistance you have in your snake arm

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
resistance you have in your snake arm
the<00:00:58.020> better<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.410> look<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> let<00:00:59.489> gravity

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the better they look if I let gravity

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.200 
the better they look if I let gravity
win<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.510> looks<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.550> unfulfilled<00:01:02.550> let's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
win it looks kind of unfulfilled let's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.330 
win it looks kind of unfulfilled let's
say<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.049> shoulder<00:01:04.680> elbow<00:01:05.220> wrist<00:01:05.630> finger

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
say so shoulder elbow wrist finger

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
say so shoulder elbow wrist finger
pushing<00:01:08.340> down<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> shoulder<00:01:09.119> engaging<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
pushing down the shoulder engaging the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.420 
pushing down the shoulder engaging the
bicep<00:01:10.260> fingertips<00:01:11.159> point<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:13.010> shoulder<00:01:14.010> elbow

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
bicep fingertips point up shoulder elbow

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.480 
bicep fingertips point up shoulder elbow
wrist<00:01:14.570> tucking<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.689> basketball<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.070> elbow

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
wrist tucking your basketball that elbow

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210 
wrist tucking your basketball that elbow
is<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> continue<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.710> then

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
is going to continue on the up and then

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.640 
is going to continue on the up and then
pushing<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:22.640> exactly<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
pushing down exactly now you can do this

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.999 
pushing down exactly now you can do this
and<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.070> small<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:28.409> large

and a very small or a very large

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.170 
and a very small or a very large
depending<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.790> what

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
depending on what

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.210 
depending on what
music<00:01:30.540> calls<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.230> you<00:01:31.440> can<00:01:31.590> play<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
music calls for you can play with that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.150 
music calls for you can play with that
variety<00:01:32.400> let's<00:01:33.060> try<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.330> on<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.480> other<00:01:33.690> side

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
variety let's try it on the other side

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.950 
variety let's try it on the other side
so<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.310> shoulders<00:01:35.760> gonna<00:01:36.000> lift<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so the shoulders gonna lift just a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.930 
so the shoulders gonna lift just a
little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> allow<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.340> elbow<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
little bit just to allow that elbow to

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.320 
little bit just to allow that elbow to
rotate<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.050> side<00:01:40.460> wrist<00:01:41.460> tucking

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
rotate out to the side wrist tucking

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.690 
rotate out to the side wrist tucking
your<00:01:42.450> ball<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.680> imagine<00:01:44.160> that<00:01:44.460> you're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
your ball and then imagine that you're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.150 
your ball and then imagine that you're
painting<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.510> back<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.110> hand<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.830> up

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
painting with the back of the hand on up

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.530 
painting with the back of the hand on up
and<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.210> palm<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> hand<00:01:49.080> hangs<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:50.540> good

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and the palm of the hand hangs down good

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840 
and the palm of the hand hangs down good
and<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.900> also<00:01:52.080> really<00:01:52.460> important<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> feel

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and it's also really important to feel

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.640 
and it's also really important to feel
like<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.180> fingers<00:01:54.540> look<00:01:54.750> pretty<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.440> you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650
