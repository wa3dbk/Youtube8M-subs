so<00:01:31.619> here's<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> standard<00:01:32.369> PC<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.479> we're

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so here's a standard PC and what we're

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
so here's a standard PC and what we're
going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.259> use<00:01:34.409> our<00:01:34.530> expansion<00:01:34.979> card<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
going to do is use our expansion card to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.210 
going to do is use our expansion card to
then<00:01:36.090> take<00:01:36.329> Express<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> go<00:01:37.079> optical<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
then take Express and go optical as you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.090 
then take Express and go optical as you
can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.960> avago<00:01:40.320> mini<00:01:40.860> pop

able to see is a 48 for terabyte drive
which<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.440> striped<00:02:38.740> for<00:02:39.430> one<00:02:39.790> terabyte<00:02:40.240> drive

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
which is striped for one terabyte drive

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.830 
which is striped for one terabyte drive
we<00:02:41.380> also<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:41.650> our<00:02:41.800> two<00:02:42.040> SSD<00:02:42.580> drives<00:02:42.850> let's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
we also have our two SSD drives let's

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.650 
we also have our two SSD drives let's
open<00:02:44.140> one<00:02:44.200> up<00:02:44.440> take<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> look<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:46.120> two<00:02:46.330> movies

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
open one up take a look of two movies

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.360 
open one up take a look of two movies
here<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:49.300> have<00:02:49.450> our<00:02:50.010> adult<00:02:51.010> drive<00:02:51.220> there<00:02:53.370> again

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
here we have our adult drive there again

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.800 
here we have our adult drive there again
showing<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> remote<00:02:55.060> expansion

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810

in here okay very quickly there's our
USB<00:03:10.630> Drive<00:03:11.110> take<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.800> look<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:13.180> we<00:03:13.360> have<00:03:13.540> some

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
USB Drive take a look there we have some

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.270 
USB Drive take a look there we have some
different<00:03:14.080> things<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> video<00:03:14.830> let's<00:03:15.130> see

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
different things on the video let's see

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.510 
different things on the video let's see
on<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.550> drive<00:03:16.890> there's<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> picture<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.370> my<00:03:18.490> new

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
on the drive there's a picture of my new

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.920 
on the drive there's a picture of my new
I<00:03:19.000> need<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.570> cati<00:03:20.010> pretty<00:03:21.010> nice<00:03:21.130> bike<00:03:21.930> let's

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
I need to cati pretty nice bike let's

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.460 
I need to cati pretty nice bike let's
see<00:03:23.080> what<00:03:23.230> else<00:03:23.290> do<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.860> here<00:03:25.350> what<00:03:26.350> is

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
see what else do we have here what is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.940 
see what else do we have here what is
that<00:03:27.510> fair<00:03:28.510> weather<00:03:28.720> radar<00:03:29.140> fan<00:03:31.770> we<00:03:32.770> better

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
that fair weather radar fan we better

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.270 
that fair weather radar fan we better
close<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.220> click

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.030 

okay<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.120> now<00:03:37.360> we'll<00:03:37.510> fire<00:03:37.750> up<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.050> plx<00:03:38.470> SDK

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
okay so now we'll fire up the plx SDK

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.100 
okay so now we'll fire up the plx SDK
say<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> very<00:03:39.819> nice<00:03:40.000> software<00:03:40.450> tool<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.870> kind<00:03:40.990> of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
say a very nice software tool to kind of

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.180 
say a very nice software tool to kind of
look<00:03:41.200> at<00:03:41.319> what's<00:03:41.500> going<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.860> inside<00:03:42.130> the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
look at what's going on inside the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.300 
look at what's going on inside the
switch<00:03:42.520> and<00:03:42.730> look<00:03:43.270> at<00:03:43.390> systems<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.410> as<00:03:44.709> we<00:03:45.130> see

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
switch and look at systems so as we see

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.730 
switch and look at systems so as we see
here<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.940> first<00:03:46.209> device<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.720> 87<00:03:47.230> 48<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
here the first device the 87 48 the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.980 
here the first device the 87 48 the
first<00:03:47.950> gen<00:03:48.190> 3<00:03:48.400> switch<00:03:48.700> that's<00:03:49.450> part<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.780> what's

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
first gen 3 switch that's part of what's

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.610 
first gen 3 switch that's part of what's
in<00:03:50.110> our<00:03:50.200> server<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:51.490> second<00:03:51.970> 87<00:03:52.510> 48<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.380> what

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
in our server the second 87 48 is what

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.100 
in our server the second 87 48 is what
goes<00:03:53.800> across<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.340> optical<00:03:54.790> link<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.239> as<00:03:55.870> part

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
goes across the optical link and as part

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.050 
goes across the optical link and as part
of<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.410> what's<00:03:56.709> inside<00:03:56.860> of<00:03:57.190> our<00:03:57.310> expansion<00:03:57.700> box

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
of is what's inside of our expansion box

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.150 
of is what's inside of our expansion box
which<00:03:58.330> allows<00:03:58.630> these<00:03:58.900> different<00:03:59.590> iOS<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.040> be

which allows these different iOS to be

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.710 
which allows these different iOS to be
shown<00:04:00.400> in<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.700> capability<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.270> express

outside<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.709> box<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.700> clicking<00:04:04.060> on<00:04:04.180> that

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
outside the box so clicking on that

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.870 
outside the box so clicking on that
device<00:04:04.540> we<00:04:04.930> now<00:04:05.080> show<00:04:05.380> what<00:04:06.160> connectivity<00:04:06.760> is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
device we now show what connectivity is

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.360 
device we now show what connectivity is
there<00:04:07.290> we<00:04:08.290> can<00:04:08.440> see<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.769> upstream<00:04:09.100> port

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
there we can see that the upstream port

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.970 
there we can see that the upstream port
is<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.519> gen<00:04:09.730> 3<00:04:09.970> by<00:04:10.120> 8<00:04:10.150> port<00:04:10.570> 64<00:04:11.410> gigabits<00:04:11.800> as<00:04:11.950> a
