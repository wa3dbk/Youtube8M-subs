little 5:2 valve to operate this so
we're<00:02:06.960> putting<00:02:07.110> air<00:02:07.350> signal<00:02:07.710> onto<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> air

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
we're putting air signal onto the air

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.010 
we're putting air signal onto the air
signal<00:02:08.759> onto<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> that's<00:02:09.630> switching

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
signal onto there and that's switching

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660

ports stop any dirt coming in and also
cut<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.459> noise<00:02:26.780> or<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.110> go<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.320> our

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
cut down the noise or we can go to our

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.750 
Sansa exhaust silence control this will
give<00:02:37.350> us<00:02:37.380> independent<00:02:38.070> speed<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.610> both

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
give us independent speed in both

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.120 
give us independent speed in both
directions<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:42.120> it'll<00:02:42.720> will<00:02:42.959> act<00:02:43.739> as<00:02:44.100> a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
directions and also it'll will act as a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.160 
directions and also it'll will act as a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:21.880 

and<00:03:12.160> vice-versa<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.150> other<00:03:13.270> direction

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.550 

and<00:03:22.880> if<00:03:23.030> we<00:03:23.120> want<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.450> we<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:23.990> increase

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
and if we want to we can then increase

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.280 
and if we want to we can then increase
the<00:03:24.680> speed<00:03:24.830> again
