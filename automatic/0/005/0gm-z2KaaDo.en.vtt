you<00:00:47.660> can<00:00:47.809> get<00:00:48.489> it's<00:00:49.489> called<00:00:49.880> new<00:00:50.090> life

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
you can get it's called new life

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.890 
you can get it's called new life
spectrum<00:00:51.520> this<00:00:52.520> one<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.850> a<00:00:52.880> cichlid<00:00:53.360> formula<00:00:54.610> I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
spectrum this one is a cichlid formula I

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.510 
spectrum this one is a cichlid formula I
like<00:00:56.900> this<00:00:57.110> one<00:00:57.320> because<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:57.860> got<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.160> small

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
like this one because it's got the small

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.840 
like this one because it's got the small
pellets<00:00:59.000> very<00:00:59.360> small<00:01:00.129> which<00:01:01.129> I<00:01:01.309> needed<00:01:01.640> for<00:01:01.790> my

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
pellets very small which I needed for my

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.190 
pellets very small which I needed for my
young<00:01:02.150> fish<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.920> it's<00:01:04.520> also<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:04.970> sinking<00:01:05.630> one

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
young fish and it's also a sinking one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.550 
young fish and it's also a sinking one
so<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:06.979> one<00:01:07.160> sinks<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:07.790> bottom<00:01:08.530> which<00:01:09.530> is

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
so this one sinks to the bottom which is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.530 
so this one sinks to the bottom which is
sort<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.490> handy<00:01:10.850> but<00:01:11.030> when<00:01:11.210> you're<00:01:11.360> feeding

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.180 
sort of handy but when you're feeding
the<00:01:11.780> fish<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.530> can<00:01:12.710> see<00:01:12.920> if<00:01:13.040> they
