at the landline here off the hey Jerr so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.910 
at the landline here off the hey Jerr so
here<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.310> puzzle<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:31.409> based<00:01:31.619> off<00:01:31.860> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
here is the puzzle and it's based off of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.730 
here is the puzzle and it's based off of
the<00:01:32.700> gear<00:01:32.939> cube<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.960> otherwise<00:01:34.380> known<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the gear cube or otherwise known as the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.609 
the gear cube or otherwise known as the
caution<00:01:34.890> cube<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.090> how<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> turns<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.960> like

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
caution cube and so how it turns is like

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.300 
caution cube and so how it turns is like
this<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.829> cross<00:01:41.070> would

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
this and you can see how the cross would

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.170 
this and you can see how the cross would
be<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.299> these<00:01:43.110> are<00:01:43.320> corners<00:01:44.180> but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
be right here and these are corners but

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.670 
be right here and these are corners but
I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> different<00:01:46.439> types<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
I think it has a different types of

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
I think it has a different types of
parody<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.340> looks<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.759> cool<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
parody on this so it looks pretty cool a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
parody on this so it looks pretty cool a
little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.810> tight<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:53.159> it'll<00:01:53.610> be

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
little bit tight and it'll be

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.999 
little bit tight and it'll be
interesting<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.450> solve<00:01:54.899> I'll<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> use

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
interesting to solve I'll have to use

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
interesting to solve I'll have to use
all<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.700> algorithms<00:01:56.880> i<00:01:57.329> use<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.659> gear<00:01:57.930> cube

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
all the algorithms i use on my gear cube

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
all the algorithms i use on my gear cube
and<00:01:58.290> maybe<00:01:58.439> even<00:01:58.590> try<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.890> figure<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.189> some

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and maybe even try and figure out some

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.649 
and maybe even try and figure out some
other<00:02:00.060> ones<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.600> it'll<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.530> fun<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.860> solve<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
other ones so it'll be fun to solve and

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.660 
other ones so it'll be fun to solve and
I'm<00:02:03.659> glad<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.530> got<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> dollar

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I'm glad I got it I got like a dollar

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.859 
I'm glad I got it I got like a dollar
off<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> somebody<00:02:06.210> through<00:02:06.509> keeps<00:02:06.719> our

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
off and somebody through keeps our

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.089 
off and somebody through keeps our
membership<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> guys<00:02:07.649> should<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.950> get

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
membership so you guys should all get

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.889 
membership so you guys should all get
your<00:02:08.459> own<00:02:08.610> nature<00:02:08.879> keeps<00:02:09.000> our<00:02:09.209> membership<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
your own nature keeps our membership I

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.270 
your own nature keeps our membership I
think<00:02:10.500> too<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
think too that would be in the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.330 
think too that would be in the
description<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.970> well<00:02:12.150> worth<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> yeah

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
description it's well worth it yeah

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.800 
description it's well worth it yeah

the land land 3 by 3 by 2 so first turns
on<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.129> puzzle<00:02:29.349> it's<00:02:30.349> pretty<00:02:30.470> smooth<00:02:30.769> it's<00:02:31.670> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
on this puzzle it's pretty smooth it's a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.759 
on this puzzle it's pretty smooth it's a
lot<00:02:31.940> smoother<00:02:32.269> than<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.510> mozy<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.440> red<00:02:33.590> 3<00:02:33.739> red

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
lot smoother than the mozy you red 3 red

2 is right out of the box the color

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.420 
2 is right out of the box the color
schemes<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> little<00:02:36.230> different<00:02:36.590> it's<00:02:37.010> yellow

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
schemes a little different it's yellow

color scheme with white and yellow be

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.390 
color scheme with white and yellow be
like<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.599> main<00:02:41.750> colors<00:02:42.110> unlike<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.099> mozy

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
like the main colors unlike the mozy

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.190 
like the main colors unlike the mozy
which<00:02:43.640> has<00:02:43.819> blue<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.330> green<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.900> top<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
which has blue and green on the top and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.199 
which has blue and green on the top and
bottom<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.620> all<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.579> other<00:02:46.700> colors<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
bottom and all the other colors on the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.610 
bottom and all the other colors on the
side<00:02:49.480> does<00:02:50.480> not<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.840> textured<00:02:51.230> stickers

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
side does not have textured stickers

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.940 
side does not have textured stickers
like<00:02:51.799> 3<00:02:52.220> by<00:02:52.340> 3<00:02:52.400> red<00:02:52.670> 2<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.450> mosey<00:02:53.780> does<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.650> so

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
like 3 by 3 red 2 and mosey does and so

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.800 
like 3 by 3 red 2 and mosey does and so
let<00:02:55.069> me<00:02:55.130> just<00:02:55.280> scramble<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.690> little

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
let me just scramble it and do a little

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.920 
let me just scramble it and do a little
solve

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.770 

alright<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.159> puzzle<00:03:04.659> performs<00:03:05.659> really

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
alright so this puzzle performs really

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.410 
alright so this puzzle performs really
well<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.290> solve<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:07.370> doesn't<00:03:08.000> lock<00:03:08.120> up<00:03:08.299> at

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
well in a solve it doesn't lock up at

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.069 
well in a solve it doesn't lock up at
all<00:03:09.159> very<00:03:10.159> smooth<00:03:10.549> on<00:03:10.730> every<00:03:10.939> single<00:03:11.030> turn<00:03:11.359> and

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
all very smooth on every single turn and

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.259 
all very smooth on every single turn and
the<00:03:12.319> algorithm<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.829> flowed<00:03:13.010> very<00:03:13.099> nicely<00:03:16.269> that

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
the algorithm is flowed very nicely that

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.899 
the algorithm is flowed very nicely that
one<00:03:17.390> wants<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.629> switch<00:03:17.840> two<00:03:18.430> edges<00:03:19.430> adjacently

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
one wants to switch two edges adjacently

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.039 
one wants to switch two edges adjacently
so<00:03:20.599> now<00:03:21.260> let's<00:03:21.439> get<00:03:21.650> into<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.639> move<00:03:22.909> Fang<00:03:23.209> fake

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
so now let's get into the move Fang fake

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.660 
so now let's get into the move Fang fake
soon<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.769> think<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.159> how<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.280> pronounce<00:03:25.370> it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
soon I think that's how you pronounce it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
something interesting is that the core

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.189 
something interesting is that the core
is<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:58.340> dark<00:04:58.789> blue<00:04:59.030> let's<00:04:59.270> see<00:04:59.389> if<00:04:59.449> you<00:04:59.539> can<00:04:59.900> see

is a dark blue let's see if you can see

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.779 
is a dark blue let's see if you can see
that<00:05:00.229> so<00:05:00.949> you<00:05:01.009> can<00:05:01.099> see<00:05:01.220> at<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.310> top<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.550> it

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
that so you can see at the top of it

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.610 
that so you can see at the top of it
there

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.320 

it's<00:05:06.340> kind<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.520> hard<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.699> see<00:05:06.880> since<00:05:07.120> it's<00:05:07.270> a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
it's kind of hard to see since it's a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.939 
it's kind of hard to see since it's a
black<00:05:07.540> puzzle<00:05:08.010> but<00:05:09.010> it<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.639> dark<00:05:10.090> blue<00:05:11.100> tour

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
black puzzle but it is a dark blue tour

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.050 
black puzzle but it is a dark blue tour
so<00:05:14.949> I<00:05:14.979> would<00:05:15.190> not<00:05:15.340> recommend<00:05:15.490> getting<00:05:15.850> the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060

so I would not recommend getting the
puzzles<00:05:16.479> in<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:17.139> waste<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.440> your<00:05:17.530> money

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
there's a waste of my money because it's

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.870 
there's a waste of my money because it's
not<00:05:20.320> migrate<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.740> puzzle<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.669> kind<00:05:21.850> of
