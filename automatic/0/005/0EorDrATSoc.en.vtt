b99 that I picked up recently in Tucson
some<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.990> them<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.260> quite<00:00:19.439> large<00:00:19.710> chunks

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.520

there's more chunks precipitate that are
precipitating<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.740> of<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:39.710> blend<00:00:40.710> of

it's

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.910 

and<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> 90%<00:00:54.920> biodiesel<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:57.590> 10%<00:00:58.590> gasoline

and is 90% biodiesel and 10% gasoline
you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:04.159> that<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> blend<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you can see up here that the blend is a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.180 
you can see up here that the blend is a
little<00:01:06.299> thinner<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> top<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
little thinner at the top and that's I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.840 
little thinner at the top and that's I
put<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> gasoline<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.509> top<00:01:13.430> or<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.700> gallons

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
put the gasoline on top or two gallons

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050 

which<00:01:25.050> I<00:01:25.229> purchased<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.009> fuel<00:01:26.340> station<00:01:26.820> in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
which I purchased at a fuel station in

two<00:01:29.280> days<00:01:29.460> ago<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.789> collected<00:01:30.450> 18<00:01:30.780> gallons<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
two days ago I collected 18 gallons of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
two days ago I collected 18 gallons of
locally<00:01:33.090> made<00:01:33.500> biodiesel<00:01:34.640> b99

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
locally made biodiesel b99

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.559 
locally made biodiesel b99
from<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.440> fuel<00:01:37.440> station<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.030> added<00:01:39.270> two

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
from a fuel station and then I added two

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.559 
from a fuel station and then I added two
gallons<00:01:39.929> gasoline<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.740> top<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.569> I

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
gallons gasoline on top of it and I

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.969 
gallons gasoline on top of it and I
noticed<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.110> away<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.679> there<00:01:43.860> were

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
noticed right away that there were

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.540 
noticed right away that there were
precipitates<00:01:44.880> forming<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.950> sat<00:01:47.399> around

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
precipitates forming and it's sat around

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.050 
precipitates forming and it's sat around
in<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:47.970> settling<00:01:48.420> tank<00:01:48.690> for<00:01:48.960> two<00:01:49.140> days<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.060> now

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
in my settling tank for two days and now

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.930 
in my settling tank for two days and now
I'm<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> draw<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.259> first

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
I'm going to draw off the first

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.120 
I'm going to draw off the first
collection<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.470> precipitates<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.679> let's<00:01:55.890> see

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
collection of precipitates and let's see

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.300 
collection of precipitates and let's see
what<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:59.240> as<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.649> there's<00:02:02.070> some

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
what we get as we can see there's some

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.660 
what we get as we can see there's some
dark<00:02:03.799> thick<00:02:04.799> stuff<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.520> too<00:02:05.640> bad

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
dark thick stuff but it's not too bad

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.009 
dark thick stuff but it's not too bad
it's<00:02:06.030> relatively<00:02:06.899> clear<00:02:08.570> not<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.600> huge

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
it's relatively clear not a huge

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:18.430 
it's relatively clear not a huge
abundance<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:16.860> let's<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.250> see

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
abundance of it so now let's just see

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.080 
abundance of it so now let's just see
what<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.560> got

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.340 

so<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:29.500> fairly<00:02:30.190> dark<00:02:31.020> but<00:02:32.020> there<00:02:32.260> are

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
so it's fairly dark but there are

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.770 
so it's fairly dark but there are
definitely<00:02:32.770> some<00:02:32.860> particles<00:02:33.640> floating<00:02:34.570> at

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
definitely some particles floating at

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.620 
definitely some particles floating at
the<00:02:34.810> bottom<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> let's<00:02:35.740> see<00:02:35.950> if<00:02:36.040> we<00:02:36.190> can

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the bottom and let's see if we can

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.470 
the bottom and let's see if we can
sunlight<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:39.040> through<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.300> see

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
sunlight going through it so we can see

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.970 
sunlight going through it so we can see
those<00:02:40.600> particles<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.250> there<00:02:42.490> we<00:02:42.880> can<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.980> some

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
those particles so there we can see some

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.420 
those particles so there we can see some
chunks<00:02:45.520> floating<00:02:46.090> at<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.420> bottom<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.430> this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
chunks floating at the bottom of this

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.230 
chunks floating at the bottom of this
sample<00:02:49.030> container<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:50.530> biodiesel<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.850> I

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
sample container of biodiesel and I

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.920 
sample container of biodiesel and I
believe<00:02:52.570> those<00:02:52.810> chunks<00:02:53.290> are<00:02:53.520> what<00:02:54.520> causes<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
believe those chunks are what causes the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.100 
believe those chunks are what causes the
plugging<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.770> fuel<00:02:57.700> filters<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.480> people<00:02:58.840> who

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
plugging of fuel filters and people who

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.460 
plugging of fuel filters and people who
first<00:03:00.070> get<00:03:00.310> started<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.940> biodiesel<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:02.350> not

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
first get started on biodiesel it's not

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.050 
first get started on biodiesel it's not
that<00:03:02.650> biodiesel<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.550> so<00:03:05.490> such<00:03:06.490> a<00:03:06.520> good<00:03:06.760> solvent

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
that biodiesel is so such a good solvent

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.820 
that biodiesel is so such a good solvent
that<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.450> cleans<00:03:07.690> up<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.050> fuel<00:03:08.290> tank<00:03:08.560> the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
that it cleans up a fuel tank the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.980 
that it cleans up a fuel tank the
problem<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.150> when<00:03:10.420> people<00:03:10.750> start

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
problem is is that when people start

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.830 
problem is is that when people start
with<00:03:11.110> biodiesel<00:03:11.560> they<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.610> some<00:03:12.940> diesel

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
with biodiesel they have some diesel

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.710 
with biodiesel they have some diesel
fuel<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.410> their<00:03:14.590> fuel<00:03:14.920> tank<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.720> diesel

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
fuel in their fuel tank and that diesel

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.040 
fuel in their fuel tank and that diesel
fuel<00:03:16.960> causes<00:03:17.590> precipitates<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.520> form<00:03:19.050> to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
fuel causes precipitates to form to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.370 
fuel causes precipitates to form to
precipitate<00:03:20.680> out<00:03:20.710> of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.100> biodiesel<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:22.600> my

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
precipitate out of the biodiesel so my

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.210 
precipitate out of the biodiesel so my
recommendation<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.960> never<00:03:25.960> put<00:03:26.320> b100<00:03:27.100> in

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
recommendation is to never put b100 in

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.750 
recommendation is to never put b100 in
the<00:03:27.340> fuel<00:03:27.610> tank<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.440> always<00:03:29.440> blend<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.430> small

the<00:04:00.700> reason<00:04:01.090> why<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.239> did<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:02.220> there<00:04:03.220> are<00:04:03.489> a

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
the reason why I did that is there are a

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.850 
the reason why I did that is there are a
number<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.970> reports<00:04:04.390> on<00:04:04.750> biodiesel<00:04:05.200> forums

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
biodiesel and my theory is is that

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.520

what's<00:04:27.900> going<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.740> there<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:29.330> said

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
what's going on is there I said

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.159 
what's going on is there I said
periodically<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.800> ad<00:04:32.330> but<00:04:33.330> petroleum

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.230

to<00:04:36.990> keep<00:04:37.169> their<00:04:37.380> biodiesel<00:04:38.040> from<00:04:38.700> gelling<00:04:39.150> in

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
to keep their biodiesel from gelling in

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.080 
to keep their biodiesel from gelling in
the<00:04:39.300> wintertime<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:41.030> action<00:04:42.030> of

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
putting a petroleum distillate with the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.240 
putting a petroleum distillate with the
biodiesel<00:04:44.100> forces<00:04:45.590> incompatible<00:04:46.590> components

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
biodiesel forces incompatible components

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.070 
biodiesel forces incompatible components
out<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.730> out<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.300> solution<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.960> they

out of that out of solution and they

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.510 
out of that out of solution and they
precipitate<00:04:49.440> out<00:04:49.889> in<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.100> bottom<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.460> the

tank<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.810> indeed<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.260> found<00:04:52.770> when<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.580> added

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
tank and indeed I found when I added

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.100 
tank and indeed I found when I added
gasoline<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.810> sample<00:04:55.290> some

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
gasoline to this sample some

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.630 
gasoline to this sample some
incompatible<00:04:58.110> components<00:04:58.740> precipitated<00:04:59.460> out

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
incompatible components precipitated out

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.050 
incompatible components precipitated out
so<00:05:00.600> I'm<00:05:00.840> going<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.320> now<00:05:01.500> measure<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.370> specific

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
so I'm going to now measure the specific

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.060 
so I'm going to now measure the specific
gravity<00:05:03.560> viscosity<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.680> sample

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
gravity viscosity of the sample

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.310 
gravity viscosity of the sample
temperature<00:05:05.730> is<00:05:06.090> fifty<00:05:06.750> eight<00:05:06.870> point<00:05:07.200> eight

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
temperature is fifty eight point eight

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.560 
temperature is fifty eight point eight
degrees<00:05:07.710> Fahrenheit<00:05:08.310> which<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.669> about<00:05:09.060> 15

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
degrees Fahrenheit which is about 15

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.900 
degrees Fahrenheit which is about 15
degrees<00:05:09.750> C<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.560> we're<00:05:11.340> going<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.490> check<00:05:11.760> the

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
degrees C so we're going to check the

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.850 
degrees C so we're going to check the
viscosity<00:05:12.300> since<00:05:12.930> we<00:05:13.080> can't<00:05:13.320> check<00:05:13.620> the

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
viscosity since we can't check the

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.950 
viscosity since we can't check the
specific<00:05:14.070> gravity

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.219 

okay<00:05:20.590> so<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.949> was<00:05:21.069> 38<00:05:21.490> 37<00:05:22.330> seconds<00:05:22.930> this<00:05:23.169> is

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
okay so it was 38 37 seconds this is

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.629 
okay so it was 38 37 seconds this is
some<00:05:24.100> of<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.280> sludge<00:05:24.610> that<00:05:24.639> came<00:05:25.569> from<00:05:26.639> my

with<00:05:32.370> gasoline<00:05:33.370> added<00:05:33.819> add<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.419> at<00:05:34.539> about

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
with gasoline added add to it at about

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.290 
with gasoline added add to it at about
90%<00:05:35.199> and<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.830> can<00:05:35.979> see<00:05:36.220> those<00:05:36.430> big<00:05:36.759> chunks<00:05:37.060> at

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
90% and you can see those big chunks at

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.809 
90% and you can see those big chunks at
the<00:05:37.419> bottom<00:05:38.039> are<00:05:40.199> what<00:05:41.199> came<00:05:41.500> out<00:05:41.699> from<00:05:42.699> the

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
the bottom are what came out from the

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.439 
the bottom are what came out from the
biodiesel<00:05:43.210> after<00:05:43.780> adding<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.250> gasoline<00:05:45.449> so

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
biodiesel after adding the gasoline so

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.600 
biodiesel after adding the gasoline so
I'm<00:05:47.110> very<00:05:47.590> glad<00:05:47.800> that<00:05:48.340> I<00:05:49.020> filtered<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:50.610> blend

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
I'm very glad that I filtered this blend

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.050 
I'm very glad that I filtered this blend
