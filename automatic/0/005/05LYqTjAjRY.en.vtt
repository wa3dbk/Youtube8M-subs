 All animal friends today I would like to introduce you to the European CRT measurement 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.680
 here we are in a suitable habitat for them 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.310
 Often she builds her nests in the halls of grain, but it needs a lot 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.799
 Patience and luck 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.410
 if you see the little life artist in the great outdoors, that's why we have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.789
 she watches for you in a terrarium 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.240
 supported is now so belong to the smallest mammals in the world 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.230
 the up to nine-gram Nardo have a size of five to seven 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.529
 centimeter 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.520
 They should keep torrent contactor value Morse in human custody 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.469
 in a terrarium with a size of at least 80 by 80 by 40 centimeters 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.490
 be housed 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.940
 In addition to vertical climbing opportunities should the animals too 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.020
 Hidden places are offered on the ground 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.960
 Willmann Eurasian dwarf Moses should breed a male and a male 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.620
 Insert female 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.760
 The rodents usually lay their nests between stalks and branches but also 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 Floor Masters are not uncommon 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.670
 the gestation period is 17 to 18 days 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.979
 Usually 3 to 8 bunk animals are born which are about the size of one 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070
 Pumpkin seeds spahn 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.819
 After about 18 days, the young leave the nest and become independent 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.590
 they are sexually mature after one month 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.380
 There are more people in the terrarium 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 to bite one that often cannibalism end 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.340
 Although the animals are three to four years old, mice are only worth it in the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 first two years reproductive 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.650
 as motor Reichmann gold hamster food and forest bird photo as well as vegetables and 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.240
 fruit 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.450
 The rodents require a high proportion of animal protein 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.010
 At least twice a week you should therefore different insects 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.280
 to evict 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.569
 For keeping Eurasian dwarf mice, no animals are allowed out 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.399
 taken from nature 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.859
 they have become rare in Germany and are protected on the list 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.159
 Species therefore only registered animals may be acquired 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 Similarly, the holder requires a corresponding licensing of the lower 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.099
 Conservation agencies 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.310
 All in all, however, Eurasian dwarf mice are interesting fosterlings 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.279
 Day are active and few make high demands on the holder as 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:33.479
 means exotic animal
