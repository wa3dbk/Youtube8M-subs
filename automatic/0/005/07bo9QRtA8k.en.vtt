it's like a little bit of silhouette a
little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> can't<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.500> up

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619

close<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:53.549> integrity<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.930> butcher

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
close on integrity is like a butcher

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.429 
close on integrity is like a butcher
knife<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.310> hand<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> shorter
