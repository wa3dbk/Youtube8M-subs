it's<00:00:11.400> really<00:00:11.580> started<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.969> kind<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.210> pick<00:00:12.360> up

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
it's really started to kind of pick up

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.660 
it's really started to kind of pick up
momentum<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.170> I'm<00:00:13.290> just<00:00:13.469> testing<00:00:13.799> my<00:00:14.070> computer

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
momentum so I'm just testing my computer

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.460 
momentum so I'm just testing my computer
it's<00:00:15.450> really<00:00:15.480> picking<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:16.230> momentum

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it's really picking up momentum

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's really picking up momentum
especially<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:18.650> people<00:00:19.650> who<00:00:19.740> are<00:00:19.830> into

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
organics and even like the health and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.099 
organics and even like the health and
beauty<00:00:23.789> people<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> getting<00:00:24.930> into

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
beauty people are kind of getting into

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.679 
beauty people are kind of getting into
it<00:00:25.260> down<00:00:25.500> too<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> don't<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.539> what

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it down too and if you don't know what

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.130 
it down too and if you don't know what
the<00:00:27.810> no<00:00:27.960> poo<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:29.519> involves<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.449> which

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the no poo is it involves of this which

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
the no poo is it involves of this which
is<00:00:31.470> absolute<00:00:32.219> vinegar<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:34.170> also<00:00:34.969> baking<00:00:35.969> soda

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
is absolute vinegar and also baking soda

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.069 
is absolute vinegar and also baking soda
I<00:00:36.540> guess<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.879> baking<00:00:38.879> soda<00:00:39.300> rinse<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I guess but you do baking soda rinse and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
I guess but you do baking soda rinse and
then<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.350> condition<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:42.320> apple<00:00:43.320> cider

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
then they condition with apple cider

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.100 
then they condition with apple cider
vinegar<00:00:43.640> Organic<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.760> course<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.210> mean<00:00:45.420> can't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
vinegar Organic of course I mean can't

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.029 
vinegar Organic of course I mean can't
do<00:00:46.200> anything<00:00:46.379> else<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:49.920> think

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
do anything else and I don't think

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.290 
do anything else and I don't think
people<00:00:50.250> research<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> these

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
people research it they go on these

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
people research it they go on these
blogs<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> these<00:00:52.379> YouTube

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
blogs and they go on these YouTube

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.010 
blogs and they go on these YouTube
videos<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.879> use<00:00:54.059> people<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.629> no<00:00:54.750> poo

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
videos and this use people going no poo

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.389 
videos and this use people going no poo
and<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.039> good<00:00:56.250> for

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and they think that it's really good for

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.319 
and they think that it's really good for
them<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.270> about

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
them but they really don't know about

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.849 
them but they really don't know about
harmful<00:00:57.719> side<00:00:58.050> effects<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.710> happen

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
harmful side effects that can happen

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.170 
harmful side effects that can happen
because<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.670> take<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> time<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
because they don't take the time to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.590 
because they don't take the time to
