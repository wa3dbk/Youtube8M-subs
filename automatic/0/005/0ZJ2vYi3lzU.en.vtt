00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
learn how to side roll just a way of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.700 
learn how to side roll just a way of
dodging<00:01:14.820> basically<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.189> just

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
dodging basically you to do it you just

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
basically it's just a form of dodging

basically it's just a form of dodging
you<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.340> learn<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> move<00:01:27.360> later<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.799> shows

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you do learn a move later on which shows

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
you do learn a move later on which shows
you<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:30.210> allows<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> better

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you which allows you to do a better

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.450 
you which allows you to do a better
dodge<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.710> use<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> place<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
dodge we use a place just like a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.020 
dodge we use a place just like a
sidestep<00:01:33.140> butter<00:01:34.579> that's<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> while

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sidestep butter that's not for a while

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
sidestep butter that's not for a while
yet<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.570> least<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.079> hard<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> pull<00:01:37.530> off

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
yet at least it's a bit hard to pull off

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
yet at least it's a bit hard to pull off
as<00:01:37.799> well<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.820> you'd<00:01:38.939> eat<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> timing

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
as well because you'd eat the timing

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.990 
as well because you'd eat the timing
just<00:01:39.930> perfect

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
just perfect

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:06.859 
just perfect
I<00:01:58.040> guess<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.220> doesn't<00:01:59.280> quite<00:01:59.790> cut<00:02:05.869> what's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
I guess this doesn't quite cut what's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.029 
I guess this doesn't quite cut what's
the<00:02:06.960> point<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.229> packing<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.619> sword<00:02:07.830> like<00:02:07.890> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the point of packing a sword like that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.250 
the point of packing a sword like that
