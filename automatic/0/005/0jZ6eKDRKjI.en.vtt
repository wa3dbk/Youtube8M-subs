00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
wouldn't expect it to have that big of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
wouldn't expect it to have that big of
details<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> big<00:00:39.210> feature<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
details but the big feature is going to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
details but the big feature is going to
be<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> retina<00:00:41.190> display<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.820> rumored<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> if

be the retina display is rumored and if
not<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> better

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
not that then it will have a better

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.470 
not that then it will have a better
feature<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:45.270> terms<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:47.300> processor<00:00:48.300> as

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
feature in terms of the processor as

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.529 
feature in terms of the processor as
well<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> basically<00:00:50.550> that's<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> event

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
