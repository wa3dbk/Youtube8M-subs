 a week since I can not read a video 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.360

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.930
 had spent a few days here my 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.870
 lightening circles have slightly 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.850
 helped a lot of people and I did not 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 I did not make it or did my skin today 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.230
 I just had a little blush so I did not 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.360
 to be very white in the video but 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.430
 you see the skin as it really is 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.550
 and how much it has helped my skin 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.260
 is the product that there is a circulation 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.780
 that's why it helps you get those 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.050
 Skin blemishes take away these things 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.090
 dark 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.190
 is a moisturizing soothing product where 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.900
 inflammatory agent that removes it 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.150
 makeup at night 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.260
 for being a product in an easy environment 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.230
 to use 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.720
 I'll get some cotton when I'm with 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.870
 makeup shot all my makeup 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.180
 rinse with very cold water but giving sex 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.260
 and it has helped a lot 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.370
 because that involved makeup that 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.030
 in cream 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.980
 I apply and does not come out very well so this 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.800
 Almond oil has helped 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.400
 in this to remove the makeup 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.540
 it is less dry skin curves and stretch marks 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.240
 and it gives shine and softness to the hair 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.400
 must stay in my hair was in a 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.440
 fight with him because I did californian 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.880
 positive you paint the color he is 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.490
 natural so I was in a fight is 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.990
 Really serious with my hair. 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.810
 retrieve the tips that were 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.580
 extremely dry and it has helped and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.970
 not to mention that it helps a lot in the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.890
 hair growth so personal is me 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.080
 I used James Bomb 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.040
 This game ended my serious hair. 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.510
 he left the very oily ones and the tips 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.580
 very dry 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.180
 so I do not know if it works for you 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.120
 I know but I was in this way with water. 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.360
 is dry and the airy tips and 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.580
 very dry tips and now my hair has 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.740
 grown up and if that is a clear beauty that 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.390
 food can help a lot 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:47.720
 but this product has been a factor that 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.340
 It has helped a lot in the hair so 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.440
 So I decided to make this video of 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.610
 recommendation is the video faster 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.160
 who wants a cool video that I love comes 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.590
 so a means of recommendation is a product 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.919
 The new one that worked with me can work. 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.340
 with you it 's a cheap product and it's too much 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:11.360
 this product people I apply so that 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.100
 He does not have that business here that gives 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.200
 to leave so much you want more 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.240
 He applies his hands 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.479
 warm 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:30.789
 and I'll apply it on my hair at the tips 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:36.970
 doing massage or tightening the 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:38.949
 ask the hair with good ones so 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.590
 People I have wet hair sorry 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.110
 He saw the wet hair is very cool this 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.930
 video because it's very hot here in sÃ£o 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.699
 Paulo is extremely hot and not 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.400
 People can not wash the bathroom. 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:54.250
 hair that is the same as nothing 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.990
 so sorry for everything we went 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.960
 I know sometimes I curl up to talk 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.569
 What I started now is everything. 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.430
 and lighting is helping her. 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:07.690
 turn on and off 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:10.479
 but I did research I tested phase six 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.430
 months and I hope they really help you. 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:15.220

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.319
