00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
my hand and it's just so sloppy it just

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.359 
my hand and it's just so sloppy it just
looks<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.000> bad<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.780> basically<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
looks so bad because it's basically the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
looks so bad because it's basically the
exact<00:01:50.850> opposite<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.170> happens<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.829> real

is just the game saying oh the past
needs<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> deflected<00:01:58.920> we're<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
needs to be deflected we're going to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
needs to be deflected we're going to
shift<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> over<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> defensive<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.110> oh

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
shift it over to the defensive back oh

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
shift it over to the defensive back oh
the<00:02:01.560> defensive<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.070> can't<00:02:02.310> catch<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the defensive back can't catch it so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.609 
the defensive back can't catch it so
it's<00:02:03.329> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> bounce<00:02:03.719> off<00:02:03.990> his<00:02:04.170> hands<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's going to bounce off his hands and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.840 
it's going to bounce off his hands and
it's<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.070> through<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> hand<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it's going to go through the hand of the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's going to go through the hand of the
receiver<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> tip<00:02:07.680> up

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
receiver and then it's going to tip up

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.619 
receiver and then it's going to tip up
in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> air<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.580> hilton's<00:02:09.060> hand<00:02:09.330> headed

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
in the air because hilton's hand headed

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.390 
in the air because hilton's hand headed
and<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.319> head<00:02:10.530> bumped<00:02:10.860> into<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and now is head bumped into it so it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.720 
and now is head bumped into it so it
needs<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> air<00:02:12.270> flow

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
needs to go up in the air flow

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.880 
needs to go up in the air flow
and<00:02:13.000> here<00:02:13.390> comes<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.780> safety<00:02:14.230> he's<00:02:14.590> going<00:02:14.800> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and here comes the safety he's going to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.559 
and here comes the safety he's going to
try<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.099> pick<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.459> up<00:02:15.550> like<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:16.000> fumble<00:02:16.450> on

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
try to pick it up like it's a fumble on

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.600 
try to pick it up like it's a fumble on
the<00:02:16.629> ground<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.319> then<00:02:17.830> I'll<00:02:17.950> by<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.400> that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the ground and then I'll by the way that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.100 
the ground and then I'll by the way that
cornerback<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.330> almost<00:02:19.540> tipped<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.959> he

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
cornerback that almost tipped it he

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
cornerback that almost tipped it he
wants<00:02:20.349> this<00:02:20.470> ball<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:20.980> bad<00:02:21.310> because<00:02:21.849> he's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
wants this ball really bad because he's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.390 
wants this ball really bad because he's
going<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.360> dive<00:02:22.690> after<00:02:23.049> it<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.530> put<00:02:23.920> his<00:02:24.010> legs

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
going to dive after it and put his legs

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.580 
going to dive after it and put his legs
through<00:02:24.849> each<00:02:25.000> other<00:02:25.239> trying<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
through each other trying to get the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.150 
through each other trying to get the
ball<00:02:26.739> up<00:02:26.799> off<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.310> ground<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
ball up off the ground and this is the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.839 
ball up off the ground and this is the
gameplay<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.599> we<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.080> deal<00:02:32.230> with<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.849> a

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
gameplay that we have to deal with on a

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.770 
gameplay that we have to deal with on a
friggin<00:02:34.510> slant<00:02:35.080> route<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:36.330> don't<00:02:37.330> understand

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
friggin slant route I don't understand

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.640 
friggin slant route I don't understand
it<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:39.430> don't<00:02:39.910> understand<00:02:40.629> it<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
it I really don't understand it it's the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.160 
it I really don't understand it it's the
most<00:02:41.829> simple<00:02:42.340> concept<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:43.000> world<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.480> throw

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
most simple concept in the world I throw

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
most simple concept in the world I throw
the<00:02:44.319> ball<00:02:44.500> someone<00:02:45.430> catches<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:45.970> or<00:02:46.150> defends

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the ball someone catches it or defends

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.500 
the ball someone catches it or defends
it<00:02:46.920> doesn't<00:02:47.920> happen<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.430> they<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
it doesn't happen in that they have to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.839 
it doesn't happen in that they have to
take<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.019> most<00:02:50.230> simple<00:02:50.799> thing<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.250> make<00:02:51.819> it

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
take the most simple thing and make it

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.119 
take the most simple thing and make it
so<00:02:52.090> complicated<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.530> me<00:02:53.650> that's<00:02:53.859> why<00:02:54.069> this

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
so complicated and to me that's why this

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.610 
so complicated and to me that's why this
game<00:02:54.549> fails<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.019> about<00:02:56.109> every

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
game fails on just about every

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
fundamental level of football because

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.729 
fundamental level of football because
when<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.629> take<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.989> time<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.349> look<00:02:59.470> at<00:02:59.620> what

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
when you take the time to look at what

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.670 
when you take the time to look at what
