high-volume and kills in the least

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.049 
high-volume and kills in the least
amount<00:01:02.769> of<00:01:02.860> time<00:01:02.979> possible<00:01:03.040> what<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:03.699> mean<00:01:03.909> by

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
amount of time possible what I mean by

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.090 
amount of time possible what I mean by
that<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.420> you're<00:01:04.989> not<00:01:05.140> playing<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.680> stay<00:01:05.860> alive

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
that is you're not playing to stay alive

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.800 
that is you're not playing to stay alive
you're<00:01:06.310> just<00:01:06.340> playing<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:07.030> get<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.270> 30<00:01:07.510> kills

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
you're just playing to get the 30 kills

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.450 
you're just playing to get the 30 kills
because<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.320> win<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.470> free-for-all<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.310> not

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
because to win a free-for-all it's not

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.859 
because to win a free-for-all it's not
about<00:01:09.640> your<00:01:09.790> kill<00:01:10.000> death<00:01:10.180> ratio<00:01:10.210> it's<00:01:10.720> just

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
about your kill death ratio it's just

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.370 
about your kill death ratio it's just
about<00:01:11.049> hitting<00:01:11.260> 30<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.960> different<00:01:13.960> strategy

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
about hitting 30 so a different strategy

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.660 
about hitting 30 so a different strategy
for<00:01:14.410> this<00:01:14.740> if<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:14.980> want<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.280> actually<00:01:15.370> stay

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
for this if you want to actually stay

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.030 
for this if you want to actually stay
alive<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.180> maybe<00:01:16.360> go<00:01:16.600> for<00:01:16.810> assault<00:01:17.800> kill

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
alive and maybe go for assault kill

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.220 
alive and maybe go for assault kill
streaks<00:01:18.340> or<00:01:18.550> maybe<00:01:19.090> even<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.480> Moab<00:01:19.780> if<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.080> get

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
into it without a strategy doesn't mean

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.120 
into it without a strategy doesn't mean
you're<00:01:31.930> gonna<00:01:32.020> Moab<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.500> lobby<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.890> still

you're gonna Moab the lobby you still
have<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.400> use<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> lot<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.820> strategy<00:01:34.360> but<00:01:34.540> if<00:01:35.140> you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
are you're gonna increase your the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.610 
are you're gonna increase your the
likelihood<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.140> happening<00:01:41.700> by<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.730> lot<00:01:43.000> but

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
likelihood of it happening by a lot but

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.350 
likelihood of it happening by a lot but
yeah<00:01:44.620> you<00:01:44.680> stay<00:01:44.980> in<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> B<00:01:45.490> domination<00:01:46.150> area

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
and you run between the three spawn

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.470 
and you run between the three spawn
points<00:01:48.070> there's<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:48.850> spawn<00:01:49.090> point<00:01:49.330> here

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
points there's one spawn point here

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.550 
points there's one spawn point here
which<00:01:49.630> you've<00:01:49.810> seen<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.080> keep<00:01:50.290> checking

which you've seen you keep checking
which<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.010> right<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:51.760> I<00:01:51.940> check<00:01:52.720> if<00:01:52.870> they're

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
which is right there I check if they're

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.510 
which is right there I check if they're
not<00:01:53.140> there<00:01:53.320> I<00:01:53.350> check<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:53.800> back<00:01:54.040> corner<00:01:54.280> right

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
not there I check this back corner right

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.740 
not there I check this back corner right
here<00:01:54.550> because<00:01:54.970> that's<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.210> second<00:01:55.540> spawn

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
here because that's the second spawn

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.430 
here because that's the second spawn
point<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.440> third<00:01:56.680> spawn<00:01:56.979> point<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.550> directly

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
point the third spawn point is directly

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.050 
point the third spawn point is directly
across<00:01:59.440> from<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.250> second<00:02:00.640> spawn<00:02:00.820> point

can watch the door you can watch the
spawn<00:02:08.619> points<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.190> it's<00:02:10.149> going<00:02:10.299> to<00:02:10.360> be<00:02:10.479> really

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
spawn points and it's going to be really

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.089 
spawn points and it's going to be really
hard<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:10.899> people<00:02:11.019> to<00:02:11.260> get<00:02:11.379> behind<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.890> with

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
hard for people to get behind you with

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.309 
hard for people to get behind you with
the<00:02:12.220> buff<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.549> sitrep<00:02:12.970> Pro<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.989> makes<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
the buff to sitrep Pro it just makes the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.960 
the buff to sitrep Pro it just makes the
strategy<00:02:14.739> even<00:02:15.129> more<00:02:15.340> effective<00:02:15.760> because

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
strategy even more effective because

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.790 
strategy even more effective because
you'll<00:02:16.330> hear<00:02:16.540> people<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:17.140> soon<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.470> they<00:02:17.590> spawn

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you'll hear people as soon as they spawn

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.740 
you'll hear people as soon as they spawn
in<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.130> start<00:02:18.400> running<00:02:18.580> even<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.510> they<00:02:19.600> have

in they start running even if they have
that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.670 
that

game I don't want to watch this well
there's<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.690> reason<00:02:53.900> why<00:02:54.170> people<00:02:54.410> use<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.769> mp7

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
there's a reason why people use the mp7

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.819 
there's a reason why people use the mp7
a<00:02:55.310> lot<00:02:55.459> it's<00:02:55.670> not<00:02:55.760> because<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.420> best

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
a lot it's not because it's the best

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.080 
a lot it's not because it's the best
submachine<00:02:57.829> gun<00:02:57.980> up<00:02:58.130> close<00:02:58.370> because<00:02:58.760> it's<00:02:58.910> not

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
submachine gun up close because it's not

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.900 
submachine gun up close because it's not
it's<00:02:59.540> kind<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.019> its<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:01.010> bad<00:03:01.190> up<00:03:01.459> close<00:03:01.700> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
it's kind of its kind of bad up close I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.550 
it's kind of its kind of bad up close I
don't<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.510> close<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.230> reason<00:03:03.470> I

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
don't like it up close but the reason I

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.530 
don't like it up close but the reason I
like<00:03:03.739> using<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.190> because<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:05.000> lets<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.329> win

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
like using it is because it lets you win

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.990 
like using it is because it lets you win
a<00:03:05.870> lot<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.470> gun<00:03:06.709> fights<00:03:06.950> mid<00:03:07.220> range<00:03:07.489> with<00:03:07.879> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
a lot of gun fights mid range with the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.550 
a lot of gun fights mid range with the
submachine<00:03:08.450> gun<00:03:08.629> that<00:03:09.110> should<00:03:09.260> normally

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
submachine gun that should normally

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.960 
submachine gun that should normally
wasn't<00:03:09.829> used<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.370> get<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.760> added

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
wasn't used so you get that added

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.089 
wasn't used so you get that added
mobility<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.750> can<00:03:11.900> run<00:03:12.079> extremely<00:03:12.590> fast<00:03:12.829> and

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
mobility you can run extremely fast and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.619 
mobility you can run extremely fast and
you<00:03:13.489> can<00:03:13.730> kill<00:03:13.910> people<00:03:14.030> for<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.299> mid<00:03:14.420> range

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
you can kill people for a mid range

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.390 
you can kill people for a mid range
that's<00:03:14.930> why<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.170> personally<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:15.980> use<00:03:16.250> it

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400
