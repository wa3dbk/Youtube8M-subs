00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.070
 And what do you prefer? 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.280
 Common brick? 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:11.280
 Or hollow brick? 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.499
 Well, what do you prefer? Economy, 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.349
 speed, speed? 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.179
 Or strength, 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.909
 load portability, 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:20.489
 external beautty? 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.480
 That is, common brick or hollow brick? 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.699
 Let's see what it is for. 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.060
 The hollow brick is used 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 as an enclosure, it works ideally 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450
 only as enclosure and not carrying loads. 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.930
 That is, when you got 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.100
 from the foundation, from the insulating layer to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.230
 a beam, for example, 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.640
 a life inside a concrete structure, 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.880
 only closing carrying loads more than its own weight. 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.720
 It does not work well when 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.960
 we support a wall of a second floor, 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.240
 That is, the brick is not prepared for that but it is prepared to close. 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.010
 However, the common brick has the capacity to carry a lot more 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.680
 load because I endure the compression very well 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.650
 being solid 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.870
 it supports very well 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.790
 the compression. Then he works 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.100
 better 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 to portability, 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 when carrying the loads to the ground. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 Then, in the enclosure, the hollow brick works well. 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.740
 Thirteen times the thickness of the wall 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.730
 and chain. 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.130
 The common brick can make simple wall of 30 can be up 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 I do not know, up to three meters without any problem. 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.450
 One is to close and the other to carry loads. With the brick 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850
 common you can download 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.570
 all the roof load or even two floors without any problem 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.390
 to the ground because it is for that, precisely for that. 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.200
 To carry loads mostly compression. 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.540
 Hollow bricks have an advantage over the common ones. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 To achieve the same thermal insulation with 18-centimeter hollow brick 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.090
 you have to make a wall of 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.959
 30 centimeters in common bricks. 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.459
 And the hollow brick wall is made much faster because the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.839
 brick is bigger and, in an hour, an officer with 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.989
 an assistant can perfectly make a square meter. 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.859
 While in the common brick 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.719
 you need four hours to make 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.759
 one square meter of a double wall 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.549
 of common bricks with air chamber. 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.539
 It is a very great advantage that hollow bricks have over the common ones. 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.839
 Another advantage of hollow bricks is 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.549
 which are much lighter. 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.299
 One square meter of a hollow brick wall 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.679
 It weighs more or less 150 kilos. 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:53.909
 While the double of common bricks, 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.319
 because it's so solid, it weighs 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.319
 approximately 450 kilos. 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.949
 With which, in the foundation, 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.179
 it's a saving 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.209
 this material 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.659
 if you use hollow bricks 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.569
 If you use common bricks 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.319
 the foundation is wider and possibly deeper too 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.829
 whereupon the foundation 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.129
 it's more expensive 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.269
 in the one of the common bricks. 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.569
 Finally, the cost. The cost of making a hollow brick wall 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.449
 of 18 centimeters 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.059
 is approximately 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.580
 30 percent cheaper than doing it 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.879
 of bricks 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.409
 common. 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.409
 It is much cheaper, 30% on the entire exterior wall is a lot of money. 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.659
 It is once an advantage that they have 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.209
 the hollow bricks over the common. 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.919
 But nevertheless, 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.069
 Many of us can opt for common bricks. 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.499
 For his strength, 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.079
 its carrying capacity, 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.639
 and its technical qualities more than hollow bricks. 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.899
 Therefore, let me know your opinion, which one do you prefer? 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.739
 If you prefer hollow bricks 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.989
 I invite you to do 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.049
 I do not like the video and if you like common bricks 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.479
 I invite you to like it. 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.329
 In my case, thumb up. 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.000
 ok I'm waiting for your vote and we will see among all the result
