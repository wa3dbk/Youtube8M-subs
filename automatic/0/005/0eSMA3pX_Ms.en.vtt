00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.360 
and it will begin to charge just like
that<00:03:47.630> it's<00:03:48.079> a<00:03:48.170> really<00:03:48.410> simple<00:03:48.620> product<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.160> use

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that it's a really simple product to use

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.220 
that it's a really simple product to use
it's<00:03:49.760> pretty<00:03:50.299> convenient<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.930> number<00:03:51.200> of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
it's pretty convenient in the number of

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.410 
it's pretty convenient in the number of
different<00:03:51.590> scenarios<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.790> example<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.299> was

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
different scenarios for example I was

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.090 
different scenarios for example I was
using<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.780> on<00:03:53.959> my<00:03:54.049> nightstand<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:54.709> when<00:03:55.070> I

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
using this on my nightstand so when I

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.009 
using this on my nightstand so when I
would<00:03:55.280> go<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.430> bed<00:03:55.730> all<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.390> would<00:03:56.630> have<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.810> do

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
would go to bed all I would have to do

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.349 
would go to bed all I would have to do
is<00:03:57.260> put<00:03:58.100> this<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.430> base<00:03:58.609> itself<00:03:58.970> and

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
is put this on the base itself and

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.990 
is put this on the base itself and
that's<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.560> didn't<00:04:00.829> have<00:04:00.889> to<00:04:01.100> mess<00:04:01.699> with<00:04:01.880> any

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that's it I didn't have to mess with any

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.620 
that's it I didn't have to mess with any
cables

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
cables

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.510 
cables
trying<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.990> plug<00:04:03.710> it<00:04:03.830> into<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.070> bottom<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.400> my

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
trying to plug it into the bottom of my

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.370 
trying to plug it into the bottom of my
phone<00:04:04.760> or<00:04:05.000> anything<00:04:05.180> like<00:04:05.330> that<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:06.170> pretty

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
phone or anything like that it's pretty

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.870 
phone or anything like that it's pretty
simple<00:04:06.620> solution<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.310> works<00:04:07.460> very<00:04:07.580> well

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
simple solution and it works very well

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.480 
simple solution and it works very well
and<00:04:08.330> there<00:04:09.260> may<00:04:09.350> be<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.500> number<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.890> other<00:04:10.070> uses

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
and there may be a number of other uses

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.950 
and there may be a number of other uses
for<00:04:10.520> this<00:04:10.850> but<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.240> was<00:04:11.420> what<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.780> was

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
for this but that was what I was

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.900 
for this but that was what I was
actually<00:04:12.200> using<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.710> for<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.580> liked<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.790> a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
actually using this for and I liked it a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.420 
actually using this for and I liked it a
lot<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:15.230> was<00:04:15.380> honestly<00:04:15.740> never<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.100> fan<00:04:16.400> of

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
lot and I was honestly never a fan of

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.699 
lot and I was honestly never a fan of
these<00:04:16.730> wireless<00:04:17.180> charging<00:04:17.690> stations<00:04:18.200> there

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
these wireless charging stations there

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.050 
these wireless charging stations there
are<00:04:18.860> a<00:04:18.890> number<00:04:19.100> there<00:04:19.459> are<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.610> few<00:04:19.820> other

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
are a number there are a few other

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.940 
are a number there are a few other
companies<00:04:20.510> making<00:04:20.720> stuff<00:04:21.170> similar<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.830> this

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
companies making stuff similar to this

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.080 
companies making stuff similar to this
but<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.150> honestly<00:04:23.660> wasn't<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.470> fan<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.710> these<00:04:25.090> but

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
but I honestly wasn't a fan of these but

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.360 
but I honestly wasn't a fan of these but
after<00:04:26.450> being<00:04:26.960> able<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.410> actually<00:04:27.560> use<00:04:27.950> one<00:04:28.160> I
