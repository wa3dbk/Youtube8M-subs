00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 here we will see the detail was for 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.680
 fold in the first curve and then 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.710
 let's see with the other camera as 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.930
 lose the shot 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.690
 to see a white thing that appears there 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.180
 now let's see more closely something that is going 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.750
 circling in the first curve the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.170
 lost 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.390
 now let's get closer there this time 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.320
 been talking and there appears the take it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.320
 turning around 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 clear design 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.810
 which means that cristian arrives 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 so to the start 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.780
 without dynamic intake 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.780
 and now let's listen 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.440
 and such 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 all right 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.890
 how 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.890
 the pilot 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.420
 things 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.750
 the mass imprisonment has put 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.040
 because they told me that I have to take it out 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.040
 please 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.690
 The one and put it happens to you 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 and the fight for him 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.110
 now not 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
 Sir 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.130
 ok long of voices 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.930
 well there was the detail not a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.700
 moment of difficult tension that I had to 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.110
 She has made others so that there were no 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.500
 had that problem or lengthen in the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.490
 taking 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.560
 or have stopped on the track in the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.000
 moment that comes out grab the take and the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.820
 friend when she arrives at the start puts her 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.350
 right there is exactly the only 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.820
 alternative that I had so as not to have 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.170
 problems and I think it looks good 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.760
 what he has done at the moment he receives the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.739
 external help 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.200
 it is clear that he receives a shot from 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.540
 outside clear part of a confusion and a 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 mistake a conceptual confusion seems to me 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.569
 because they emphasized that moment 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.549
 that I understand that is extreme 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.159
 tension a very high stress a madness 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.590
 total where it is stressed that no 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.420
 put it the pilot sack and put the pilot 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.730
 as if that would change things not 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.310
 it mattered no but it was up to the confusion 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.750
 in any case I assigned him to confusion 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.159
 case beyond people so 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.690
 experience as cachi scarazzini as 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.970
 the toto that the whole thing is silent 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.470
 says nothing because he knows that he senses that 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.849
 it's wrong it 's obvious that but it's going to 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.889
 please it is about pressing a little 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.579
 open rafÃ¡h situations or petrucci 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.280
 now they say yes but it was another another list 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.580
 or it was very clear outside that was very 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.580
 Clear
