00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.029
 a speech that of the documentation 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.440
 on documentation 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:17.190
 yes therefore they have known these 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:21.270
 important masters also the capogrossi and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.720
 so much more with my first experiences 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:32.489
 with these advanced bone tubes 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 market on boxes won by scarpi 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 such stuff should be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.660
 interesting if only he could portray them 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.170
 today that is almost impossible because later 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.260
 experiences have also been made with 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:53.760
 the offenders of the doctors found facts with the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.280
 pop art and always if it was curious to see 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.100
 if naive painting on these boxes 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 my sheet but I believe that this is all 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.040
 this is definitely lost not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 I believe it is I don't think it's a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.049
 big bad for humanity experience more 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.049
 series 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.020
 then I started doing and attending 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.600
 of a bourgeois gallery are things that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.520
 I grow old and always in years 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.659
 immediately preceding the war 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.320
 or immediately following following 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.320
 war 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:42.140
 severini fragolini these sedini 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.399
 ferrazzi is passing nothing met 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.189
 right tip roma mente be a painter 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.009
 naturalized French but in the last 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.009
 years of the war had moved to Rome 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:06.869
 he was near the rai piazza mazzini but 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.720
 I had met him in a gallery 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.569
 that of the zodiac where he 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:19.620
 exhibited the Terni mosaics doing and 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.640
 he made friends precisely that he also did 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.299
 of me pencil dashes that I believe the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.980
 widow and paul fort's daughter with salt 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:35.609
 still not revised then in paris 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.069
 from the gallery on 20 etc. then I have 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.069
 could not attend very much 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.190
 what should I say family seemed 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.260
 even be judged 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.740
 interesting to show some e 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.740
 quadretti had been interested enough 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.820
 then you know they even made me some 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.030
 little pleasure because during the war 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.370
 the via roma there was no color a 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.380
 I have made oil from Florence 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.230
 I 'm not interesting which one with 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.350
 personality I do n't know I got 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:24.160
 of the colors of not of great value a 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.989
 colors of the most flights that are not alone 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.239
 if he had the courage I could have 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:34.200
 buy something in that first like the 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 my first study a bedroom 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.800
 we had the big case as the crif 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.739
 except a tripod with a tripod 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.930
 scale shot of the colors a bit from 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.209
 amateur wooden ones with many 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:55.110
 colors inside of palette and brushes a 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.110
 measure blocks 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.370
 my experiences multiplied all these 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.660
 marginal facts that passed in second 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.260
 plan 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:15.260
 the hardest with what I felt a 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:24.250
 speech at intervals with this 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.250
 wait a moment excuse wonder if 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.170
 cut the Michelis astro weapons him years 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.420
 ago but I had read in the articles 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.460
 on the Tuscan illustration with delle 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:49.430
 reproductions by chance I met him with a 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.850
 tonfano and then fasani processes a 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:57.290
 johnson attacking speech accessed 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.600
 take the pens enough the friend of e 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.530
 know them I knew size first i 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.260
 outfits know trampolines that was 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.790
 guest of italy 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:20.710
 at that time it was called 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:20.710
 marble sculptures of s 79 flying glass 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.920
 I made the sculptures that commendable these 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.340
 chronicles made them in pietrasanta 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.770
 reminds me that he washed with taio of 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.600
 this poster significance holy square 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.960
 with an old ford it has like those of 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.690
 ridolini very heavy because cut 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.820
 every so often we get distracted say 4 a 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.820
 change it to the linseed alone 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:51.620
 also at the steering the tape and tells 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:56.050
 the phases of the sector and also trampolines and 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:00.110
 he began to come sometimes 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:04.700
 pietrasanta alberghini did not do 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.960
 sculptures instead had tarsi and marbles 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.330
 colored by a re and diet specialist 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.740
 saint who will be called but the flasks 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.740
 primary fiasco 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.640
 genoa a very light color fans but 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.100
 at home gay drop 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.100
 yes yes indeed indeed 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:32.220
 he wanted to redo gauguin seasickness 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.479
 dematerializing using colors 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:43.410
 transparent and flexible 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:48.660
 here, however, trying to draw from it all is 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:51.810
 possible all the profit possible from 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.840
 these futurist experiences but in the 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:07:00.569
 the same time, don't miss flights too 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:03.479
 the most realistic studies portrayed but 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:09.569
 even these perhaps surfaced from the 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:11.659
 same root which the unconscious I do not 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.589
 I never did painting 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:17.610
 in short, overly optic 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:20.279
 sectarian traits was a bit of an idea 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:27.800
 of the retracted people then 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:29.990
 here surfaced for this reason me 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.159
 I do not think it's fair to make 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:36.409
 big distinctions between abstraction to 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:40.039
 important realism than in this 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:45.610
 realism has merit content 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:45.610
 which are insured precisely by the ongoing
