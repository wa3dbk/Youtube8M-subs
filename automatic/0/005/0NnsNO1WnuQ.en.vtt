this<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.290> quick<00:00:01.500> video<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.920> show<00:00:02.070> how<00:00:02.460> you

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
this is a quick video to show how you

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.170 
this is a quick video to show how you
remove<00:00:03.090> abs<00:00:03.720> parts<00:00:04.170> off<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:05.100> glass<00:00:05.879> plate

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
remove abs parts off of a glass plate

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.919 
remove abs parts off of a glass plate
that<00:00:06.600> has<00:00:06.810> either<00:00:07.799> kapton<00:00:08.370> tape<00:00:08.400> or<00:00:08.849> p<00:00:08.970> ET<00:00:09.330> tape

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
that has either kapton tape or p ET tape

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.530 
that has either kapton tape or p ET tape
on<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.500> then<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.160> top<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:12.360> order

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
on it and then on top of that in order

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.660 
on it and then on top of that in order
to<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.900> large<00:00:13.259> parts<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.799> actually<00:00:14.070> sit<00:00:14.309> flat

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
to get large parts to actually sit flat

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.689 
to get large parts to actually sit flat
then<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.540> actually<00:00:16.020> use<00:00:16.500> what's<00:00:16.920> called<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.340> BS

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
then I actually use what's called a BS

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.929 
then I actually use what's called a BS
juice<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> good<00:00:19.619> news<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.340> keeps

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
juice and the good news is that it keeps

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.880 
juice and the good news is that it keeps
all<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.180> parts<00:00:21.630> your<00:00:21.990> first<00:00:22.289> layer<00:00:22.470> very

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
all your parts your first layer very

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
all your parts your first layer very
very<00:00:23.160> well<00:00:23.400> bonded<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> plate<00:00:24.600> bad<00:00:25.289> news

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
very well bonded to the plate bad news

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.679 
very well bonded to the plate bad news
is<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> makes<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.340> considerably<00:00:26.939> harder<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is it makes it considerably harder to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
is it makes it considerably harder to
actually<00:00:27.840> remove<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.560> things<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.490> here's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
actually remove the things but here's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.479 
actually remove the things but here's
what<00:00:30.090> i<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.900> once<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.890> put<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.099> abs

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
what i do is that once I put the abs

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.100 
what i do is that once I put the abs
juice<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> let<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> dry<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> use<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
juice on there I let it dry I use a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200 
juice on there I let it dry I use a
fairly<00:00:34.620> thin<00:00:34.860> coat<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
fairly thin coat of it because if you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
fairly thin coat of it because if you
get<00:00:36.690> too<00:00:36.870> thick<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.469> sometimes<00:00:38.430> doesn't

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
get too thick then it sometimes doesn't

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
get too thick then it sometimes doesn't
hold<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.149> good<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.559> use<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
hold very good and if you don't use it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
hold very good and if you don't use it
at<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.340> doesn't<00:00:41.489> hold<00:00:41.700> very<00:00:41.969> good<00:00:42.180> but

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
at all it doesn't hold very good but

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
at all it doesn't hold very good but
when<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.620> use<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> fairly<00:00:44.340> light

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
when you actually use a fairly light

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
when you actually use a fairly light
coating<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.110> adheres

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
coating of it then it actually adheres

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
coating of it then it actually adheres
really<00:00:47.160> really<00:00:47.460> well<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
really really well so what I'm going to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.020 
really really well so what I'm going to
do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> try<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.920> remove<00:00:50.250> these<00:00:50.460> parts<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
do is try and remove these parts and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
do is try and remove these parts and
you'll<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.020> holds<00:00:52.410> pretty

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you'll see that it actually holds pretty

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.209 
you'll see that it actually holds pretty
well<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:57.079> never<00:00:58.079> actually<00:00:58.379> touched<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
well so I never actually touched the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.150 
well so I never actually touched the
plate<00:00:59.520> because<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.379> any<00:01:01.559> oil<00:01:01.920> or

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
plate because you get any oil or

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
plate because you get any oil or
fingerprints<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:02.940> anything<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.629> i

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
fingerprints or anything on there i

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289 
fingerprints or anything on there i
touch<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> outside<00:01:05.369> edges<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.180> never

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
touch the outside edges of it but never

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
touch the outside edges of it but never
actually<00:01:06.540> touch<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> plate<00:01:07.290> itself<00:01:07.700> then

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
actually touch the plate itself then

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
actually touch the plate itself then
then<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> hard<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.470> things

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
then it's kind of hard one of the things

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
then it's kind of hard one of the things
I<00:01:10.860> use<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> light<00:01:11.520> razor<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.270> actually

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I use is a light razor to actually

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
I use is a light razor to actually
scrape<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.110> outline<00:01:13.530> very<00:01:13.920> very<00:01:14.100> lightly

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
scrape up the outline very very lightly

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
scrape up the outline very very lightly
and<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.740> removes<00:01:17.159> pretty<00:01:17.460> well<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> let's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and that removes pretty well so let's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.840 
and that removes pretty well so let's
see<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.729> these<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:22.700> some<00:01:23.700> pieces

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
see if we can get these off some pieces

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
see if we can get these off some pieces
are<00:01:24.180> harder<00:01:24.450> than<00:01:24.479> others<00:01:26.930> good<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.799> very

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
are harder than others good very very

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
are harder than others good very very
flat<00:01:29.460> parts<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.119> possible<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.780> ABS<00:01:31.229> juice

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
flat parts are possible with ABS juice

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
flat parts are possible with ABS juice
with<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.979> combination<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
with this combination you really have to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.499 
with this combination you really have to
tug<00:01:36.479> sometimes<00:01:37.340> if<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.790> doesn't<00:01:39.119> come<00:01:39.299> right

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
tug sometimes if it doesn't come right

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
tug sometimes if it doesn't come right
away<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> things<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
away then one of the things I do is I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
away then one of the things I do is I
take<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> off<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> edge<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> table<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
take it off the edge of a table and I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.429 
take it off the edge of a table and I
just<00:01:43.740> lightly<00:01:44.040> press<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.909> glass<00:01:45.259> until<00:01:46.259> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
just lightly press the glass until you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.469 
just lightly press the glass until you
okay<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> hear<00:01:47.369> some<00:01:47.640> cracking<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
okay you can hear some cracking of it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
okay you can hear some cracking of it
not<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> glass<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> bonding<00:01:50.820> between

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
not the glass but of the bonding between

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.710 
not the glass but of the bonding between
the<00:01:51.299> glass<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.810> parts<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.479> kind

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the glass and the parts so you can kind

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.850 
the glass and the parts so you can kind
of<00:01:54.780> hear<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> the
