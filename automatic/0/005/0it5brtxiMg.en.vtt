00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.910 
from the very beginning I wanted a
cooperative<00:03:27.700> departure<00:03:28.690> from<00:03:28.840> TCW<00:03:29.530> from<00:03:29.830> the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
cooperative departure from TCW from the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.280 
cooperative departure from TCW from the
day<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.100> was<00:03:30.280> fired<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.970> wanted<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.480> settle<00:03:32.019> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
day I was fired I wanted to settle and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.780 
day I was fired I wanted to settle and
have<00:03:33.040> an<00:03:33.220> amicable<00:03:33.670> type<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.440> disengagement

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
have an amicable type of disengagement

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.460 
have an amicable type of disengagement
TCW<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.940> think<00:03:37.239> felt<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:38.049> would<00:03:38.200> be<00:03:38.230> able

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
TCW I think felt that they would be able

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.550 
TCW I think felt that they would be able
to<00:03:39.030> basically<00:03:40.030> confiscate<00:03:40.989> all<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
to basically confiscate all of the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.120 
to basically confiscate all of the
fruits<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.190> labor<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:43.390> my<00:03:43.570> team<00:03:43.780> had

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
fruits of the labor that my team had

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.560 
fruits of the labor that my team had
accomplished<00:03:45.130> over<00:03:45.280> time<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:45.880> just<00:03:46.209> save<00:03:46.540> a

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
your outlook on the market right now I

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.420 
your outlook on the market right now I
think<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.820> market<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.239> very<00:03:59.280> people<00:04:00.280> are<00:04:00.370> very

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
think the market is very people are very

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.610 
think the market is very people are very
pessimistic<00:04:00.700> for<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.450> short<00:04:01.690> term<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.560> both

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
pessimistic for the short term on both

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.400 
pessimistic for the short term on both
the<00:04:03.280> Euro<00:04:03.700> which<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.329> collapsed<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.019> also<00:04:05.290> on

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
the Euro which is collapsed and also on

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.900 
the Euro which is collapsed and also on
the<00:04:05.500> stock<00:04:05.709> market<00:04:05.739> which<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.430> tied<00:04:06.730> together

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
the stock market which is tied together

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.240 
the stock market which is tied together
with<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.269> I<00:04:07.660> think<00:04:07.989> for<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.170> short<00:04:08.410> term<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
with that I think for the short term the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.800 
with that I think for the short term the
Bears<00:04:09.489> are<00:04:09.640> going<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.850> be<00:04:09.940> disappointed<00:04:10.120> and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
Bears are going to be disappointed and

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.449 
Bears are going to be disappointed and
that<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.290> market<00:04:11.620> will<00:04:11.680> hang<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.100> there<00:04:12.280> but<00:04:12.430> I

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
that the market will hang in there but I

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.640 
that the market will hang in there but I
do<00:04:12.549> think<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.750> economy<00:04:13.989> is<00:04:14.260> going<00:04:14.500> to

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
do think that the economy is going to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.219 
do think that the economy is going to
run<00:04:14.829> into<00:04:15.010> trouble<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.400> 2011<00:04:16.359> with<00:04:16.930> tax

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
run into trouble in 2011 with tax

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.530 
run into trouble in 2011 with tax
increases<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.640> pulling<00:04:19.299> away<00:04:19.390> of

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
increases and the pulling away of

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.510 
increases and the pulling away of
stimulus<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:20.289> ultimately<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.950> think<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
stimulus and so ultimately I think the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.540 
stimulus and so ultimately I think the
next<00:04:21.729> big<00:04:22.060> move<00:04:22.090> in<00:04:22.599> risk<00:04:23.560> assets<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.280> going<00:04:24.490> to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
next big move in risk assets is going to

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.200 
next big move in risk assets is going to
be<00:04:24.669> lower

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
be lower

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.999 
be lower
so<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.660> think<00:04:25.990> I've<00:04:26.169> been<00:04:26.289> advocating<00:04:26.889> at

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
so I I think I've been advocating at

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.760 
so I I think I've been advocating at
about<00:04:27.430> eleven<00:04:27.759> fifty<00:04:28.180> on<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.720> sp500<00:04:29.259> is<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
about eleven fifty on the sp500 is a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.070 
about eleven fifty on the sp500 is a
good<00:04:30.009> liquidation<00:04:30.580> point<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:31.389> a<00:04:31.419> strong<00:04:31.810> hand

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
good liquidation point for a strong hand
