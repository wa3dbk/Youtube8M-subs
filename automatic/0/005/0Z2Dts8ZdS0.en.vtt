00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.900 
and the fingering on this one's a little
bit<00:03:30.360> trickier<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.140> because<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
bit trickier just because of the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.480 
bit trickier just because of the
interval<00:03:32.910> placement<00:03:33.570> it's<00:03:34.080> more<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.100> less<00:03:35.190> the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
interval placement it's more or less the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.330 
interval placement it's more or less the
same<00:03:35.730> formula<00:03:37.040> with<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.600> root<00:03:39.810> note

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
same formula with the root note

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.010 
same formula with the root note

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020

than a major minor seventh and then I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.860 
than a major minor seventh and then I
hit<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.380> diminished<00:03:46.860> fifth<00:03:47.160> as<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> chord<00:03:47.870> or

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
hit the diminished fifth as a chord or

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.980 
hit the diminished fifth as a chord or
and<00:03:49.200> then<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.100> repeat<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> pattern<00:03:51.150> sort<00:03:51.930> of

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
and then I repeat the pattern sort of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.920 
and then I repeat the pattern sort of
gradually<00:03:52.530> ascending<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.630> kind<00:03:54.870> of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
gradually ascending and it's kind of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.870 
gradually ascending and it's kind of
it's<00:03:55.380> kind<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.650> cumbersome<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.400> fingering

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
it's kind of cumbersome the fingering

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.660 
it's kind of cumbersome the fingering
and<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.780> with<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.020> beef<00:03:58.320> string<00:03:58.800> tuning

difference keep the dye on that you

difference keep the dye on that you
should<00:04:03.030> be<00:04:03.150> okay<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.600> again<00:04:06.600> the

should be okay but you know again the

blisteringly fast just to just to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.780 
blisteringly fast just to just to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
the fly so there you go enjoy thanks for

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:29.200 
the fly so there you go enjoy thanks for
watching

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210
