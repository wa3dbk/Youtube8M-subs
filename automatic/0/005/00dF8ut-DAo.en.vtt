00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
a couple of drops of alcohol on the top

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.620 
a couple of drops of alcohol on the top
and<00:02:23.140> put<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> in<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.220> small<00:02:24.489> baggie<00:02:25.060> or<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> ball

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
and put it in a small baggie or a ball

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.630 
and put it in a small baggie or a ball
jar<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.200> keeps<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.709> from<00:02:26.739> hardening<00:02:27.459> so

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
jar and that keeps it from hardening so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.949 
jar and that keeps it from hardening so
you<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.910> keep<00:02:28.090> using<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.540> over<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.900> over

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
takes less to actually charge it up to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.560 
takes less to actually charge it up to
