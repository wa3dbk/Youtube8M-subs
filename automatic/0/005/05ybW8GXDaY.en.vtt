00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.920
 today I'm going to record the video 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.490
 of my collection of portfolios that are the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.580
 which I use most every day so I hope that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 like it and let's start the first 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.450
 I'm going to show you this portfolio my 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.450
 wallets are all great 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.020
 do not 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.879
 another game that I am going to teach you is 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.879
 is 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.710
 these green 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 it is much clearer how the camera looks 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200
 and has 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.059
 in closing then the portfolios I use 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.000
 daily a large collection but now 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.400
 is where I occupy 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 the others are some that are branded 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.990
 another two is also that is super 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.990
 big black basic 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.110
 this portfolio is also against 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 it will happen 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.630
 with cigars or in marches 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.730
 precious 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.550
 I do not know if they can be appreciated well in 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.290
 camera 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.190
 between the portfolios that are spacious 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.190
 following 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 and they are interlaced in a long loop 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.320
 and a short 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.450
 this time 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.630
 with formaldehyde 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.590
 these little chiquititas blacks that I have 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.590
 what to defend 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.819
 little girl 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.760
 with its handle 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.830
 of hands 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.830
 the other one I have is this 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.920
 because this one like 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.480
 simulates a reptile leather 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.700
 it is completely flat and it brings the handle 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 incorporated within the portfolio 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 is beautiful 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 within 15 is red A 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.120
 american red 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 and I like it because inside is 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.870
 completely gang 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.870
 they all have cellular doors 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.850
 this also brings clarity but not 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.980
 I use it 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.200
 the next one that I'm going to teach you is 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.790
 until one of my favorites 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.230
 this is a fan of an imitation of 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.450
 fendi 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.739
 and traca 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.610
 the particularity that it brings as a 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.550
 trench 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.120
 and it's really beautiful coffee I die with 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.140
 Kisses 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.140
 this is an imitation 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.030
 what I do have is this 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.640
 noguchi 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.640
 you see 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.230
 They are quite big, it's also coffee 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.900
 model with the slats brings the card 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.340
 miniature and 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.400
 that really but more 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.750
 I will teach them very quickly so that the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.290
 video is not eternal 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.180
 s was in quarry 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.879
 which is super known 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.380
 what is to live in the black month but 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:09.470
 obviously that is an imitation 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.130
 and they emphasize given the key that comes here 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.230
 I can always 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.760
 And like me 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.760
 so traditional 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.259
 is beautiful 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.730
 imitation crocodile leather 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.730
 with 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.820
 with how 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.280
 with these objectives here as of the 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.100

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.740

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.950
 beautiful is with reliefs 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.740
 and to draw well 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:58.000

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.880

 problems with the camera for some reason 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.210
 or another had not cost much to record well 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.100
