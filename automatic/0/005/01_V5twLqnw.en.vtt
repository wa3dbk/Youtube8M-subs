00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.690
 hello everyone and welcome the recipes 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:11.280
 of gps today we are going to make the play dough 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 the ingredients 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.300
 a cup of salt two cups of flour 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.670
 tablespoon dye cream 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 treated and two tablespoons of oil 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.510
 vegetable first we're going to put all 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.529
 the ingredients in jail canvas and 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.130
 you are also going to add two layers of water and 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.850
 we are going to mix it in a temperature 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.590
 very low but it takes a long time you have 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.590
 to continue to mix 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 and mix 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.850
 and mix 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.800
 until it has the appearance of a 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 plasticine dough 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.960
 now you 're going to put it in a table 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.790
 chop and you will knead it with your hands 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 It can be very hot when it comes out of the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.760
 series pan make sure you have 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.550
 chilled a little before doing this and 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.210
 now you see I am dividing it into 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.479
 parties and I have decided to divide it into 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.750
 six parts because I want six colors 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.750
 different 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 once done that we're going to catch the ball 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.970
 put a hole in the middle and add 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.730
 a few droplets of dye in the center 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.790
 and then everything you have to do 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.060
 is to knead this so that the color is 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.980
 put on the whole ball is very important 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.780
 Put on gloves because if not your hands 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.290
 They will also have the same color 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.140
 the plasticine and you see I'm adding 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.900
 a little more a little more color 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.090
 so that it is the darkness that I want 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.720
 and it's perfect 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.480
 the 'pit stop' for each color you can 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.800
 make a rainbow 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.230
