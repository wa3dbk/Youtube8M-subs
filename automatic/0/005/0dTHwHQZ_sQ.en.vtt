in here and change the front tire I use
the<00:05:11.930> new<00:05:12.080> jawline<00:05:12.740> transistor<00:05:13.370> before<00:05:13.670> for

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
the new jawline transistor before for

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.090 
the new jawline transistor before for
all<00:05:14.300> qualifying<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:14.960> practice<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.920> now<00:05:16.070> I

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
all qualifying and practice and now I

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.490 
all qualifying and practice and now I
changed<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.730> oil<00:05:17.000> suburbs<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.870> it's<00:05:18.320> way

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
changed the oil suburbs and it's way

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.830 
changed the oil suburbs and it's way
better<00:05:18.680> for<00:05:19.340> me<00:05:19.490> because<00:05:19.940> no<00:05:20.120> consistent<00:05:20.660> more

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
better for me because no consistent more

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.050 
better for me because no consistent more
schools<00:05:21.260> not<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:21.530> aggressive<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.850> I<00:05:23.000> think

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
schools not so aggressive and I think

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.360 
schools not so aggressive and I think
this<00:05:23.270> made<00:05:23.510> my<00:05:23.630> car<00:05:23.810> much<00:05:24.020> better<00:05:24.230> I<00:05:24.560> wonder

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
this made my car much better I wonder

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.740 
this made my car much better I wonder
what<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.730> your<00:05:25.850> strategy<00:05:26.030> then<00:05:26.420> going<00:05:26.630> in

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
what is your strategy then going in

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.970 
what is your strategy then going in
tomorrow<00:05:26.990> knowing<00:05:27.350> that<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.620> start<00:05:27.890> in<00:05:27.950> the

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
tomorrow knowing that you start in the

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.980 
tomorrow knowing that you start in the
back<00:05:28.100> of<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.340> pack<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.820> really<00:05:29.810> at<00:05:29.930> that

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
back of the pack and really at that

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.530 
back of the pack and really at that
point<00:05:30.340> your<00:05:31.340> goal<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.580> just<00:05:31.730> to<00:05:31.940> pass<00:05:32.180> as<00:05:32.360> many

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
point your goal is just to pass as many

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.930 
point your goal is just to pass as many
cars<00:05:32.810> you<00:05:32.930> can<00:05:33.080> yeah<00:05:33.500> for<00:05:33.710> sure<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:34.100> am<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.340> can

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
cars you can yeah for sure I am I can

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.090 
cars you can yeah for sure I am I can
lose<00:05:35.600> nothing<00:05:35.870> because<00:05:36.110> when<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.530> break<00:05:36.770> three

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
lose nothing because when I break three

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.640 
lose nothing because when I break three
times<00:05:37.310> I'm<00:05:37.460> finish<00:05:37.730> 11th<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:38.450> I<00:05:38.810> try<00:05:39.470> my<00:05:39.620> best

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
times I'm finish 11th so I try my best

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.100 
times I'm finish 11th so I try my best
maybe<00:05:40.010> maybe<00:05:40.670> like<00:05:40.880> six<00:05:41.150> seven<00:05:41.480> I<00:05:41.600> can<00:05:41.780> make<00:05:41.960> I

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
maybe maybe like six seven I can make I

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.360 
maybe maybe like six seven I can make I
think<00:05:42.380> well<00:05:43.370> good<00:05:43.490> luck<00:05:43.580> tomorrow<00:05:43.730> thank<00:05:44.270> you
