these new 15 master prestige levels it's

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.219 
these new 15 master prestige levels it's
confirmed<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.239> will<00:03:30.419> not<00:03:30.659> lose

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
neither of those will reset so basically

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.149

prestige<00:04:13.319> already<00:04:13.859> this<00:04:14.370> will<00:04:14.609> be

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
prestige already this will be

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.580 
prestige already this will be
frustrating<00:04:15.329> you'd<00:04:15.870> have<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.049> grind<00:04:16.380> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
frustrating you'd have to grind the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.110 
frustrating you'd have to grind the
normal<00:04:16.889> master<00:04:17.190> prestige<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.820> then<00:04:17.909> grind

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
normal master prestige and then grind

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.089 
normal master prestige and then grind
even<00:04:18.509> further<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:19.019> reap<00:04:19.199> any<00:04:19.380> benefits<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
even further to reap any benefits of the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.710 
even further to reap any benefits of the
elite<00:04:20.279> weapon

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.110 
elite weapon
I'd<00:04:21.500> say<00:04:21.739> if<00:04:21.829> your<00:04:21.980> prestige<00:04:22.310> five<00:04:22.640> are<00:04:22.910> lower

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
I'd say if your prestige five are lower

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.640 
I'd say if your prestige five are lower
currently<00:04:23.600> you're<00:04:23.810> probably<00:04:24.140> better<00:04:24.530> off

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
currently you're probably better off

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.530 
currently you're probably better off
just<00:04:24.920> opening<00:04:25.340> supply<00:04:25.670> drops<00:04:25.940> in<00:04:26.150> hopes<00:04:26.390> of

just opening supply drops in hopes of

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.600 
just opening supply drops in hopes of
getting<00:04:26.780> an<00:04:26.870> elite<00:04:27.080> weapon<00:04:27.410> as<00:04:27.620> mentioned

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
getting an elite weapon as mentioned

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.800 
getting an elite weapon as mentioned

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
though some of the elite weapons aren't

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.270 
though some of the elite weapons aren't
even<00:04:30.110> available<00:04:30.560> with<00:04:30.740> these<00:04:30.890> master

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.980 
prestige levels and some of the ones
that<00:04:33.380> are<00:04:33.560> aren't<00:04:33.980> any<00:04:34.070> good<00:04:34.310> at<00:04:34.520> all<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.840> let
