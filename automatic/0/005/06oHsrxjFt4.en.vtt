00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.589
 other things being equal here does not have 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.400
 rival equality of conditions I mean 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 everyone with a break all at first 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 test second test in tuning 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.070
 it's about here it's still a big favorite 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 it is undoubted 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.810
 if it fails to destroy an advantage 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.540
 62 seconds 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.180
 fascinating and then on electro here is not 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.010
 better but it's not the same be better 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.570
 bottom that nothing better reading in the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.910
 styles do not confuse who is in 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.770
 a track more than 10 years everything was better 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.840
 for this jail but in it two styles 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.879
 he stuck a bath in the stretch of the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.489
 program are impressive because it is 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.410
 stylist then that 's what 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.629
 we try to explain and what we try 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 say because in the end these species the 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.130
 swimming pool 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.640
 if it is clear that it is not the best 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.590
 It has all four styles 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.750
 I do not know what better best for himself what 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.300
 who is more tired is the one who has 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.330
 suffered is everything but good has happened 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.490
 first 50 and 75 this is normal while 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 the distant goal to the prosecutor and layers to 57 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 7 because it will be positive for the east where 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 he has to get as much as possible because 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 here here is not a fantastic espaldista 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 we already know we've all seen it and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.659
 six kalish this morning we said it was 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.490
 bad badger no no no we could not 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.650
 appreciate what I've been slow but 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 we'll see what is wrong for an espaldista 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.799
 write the die accepted thiago pereira 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.259
 Of course then they take it out as much 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.530
 in the partial is that the one that has passed 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.810
 sixth was more than two seconds away 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.450
 not for the moment things the final will be 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.399
 put in there there not 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.560
 is responding well in this first 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.380
 part of the test in these first two 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 Styles 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.670
 and we see very delayed 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.410
 when we talk about this obviously it 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 He withdrew with me since he took me five 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:20.650
 bodies in carbon but of course it is not 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.870
 same with instruments to draw a lot is 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.019
 a lot of distance 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.430
 Here we will see progression control 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.379
 the distance is 5 seconds 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 that nobody is going to put on medals or 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.890
 similar after this branch 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.650
 at the moment the two Japanese leading 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.100
 this final of four styles both 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.670
 Americans behind 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.480
 tomás fraser and thiago pereira 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.480
 more delayed 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.750
 and I do not know everything cleric 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.500
 and there we see how 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 if everything is also reaching that 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.710
 there is not giving everything absolutely 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.270
 all 624 spatial options of embers 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.220
 in authentic varied julia díaz is in 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.660
 medals yes yes and is fighting with the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.030
 third position but I will do what 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 same is a lot of distance crawl is very 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.720
 good florist 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.620
 but here not that here does not escape 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.500
 this has sincerely been complicated in the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.160
 third 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.160
 very much 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.910
 and third, the Brazilian inspect that 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.230
 is finishing well in good go hand 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.690
 by hand that we are having among the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.940
 two Japanese between sixth and there not 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.340
 streets that are incorporated into fights 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.590
 sensational external what we talk about 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.810
 worse but list in a 200 free there's no 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.180
 No doubt he does not do 145 like he does here 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.550
 no but it 's stylist then it's going to 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.040
 run a lot and you're going to stand up and 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.709
 ojito with 7 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.239
 good how is the final we will see 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.549
 this sprint that is keeping the 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.209
 Japanese endure and pereira is 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.040
 Squeezing is also scalise 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.590
 well here what is suffering this what 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.810
 that we speak, I find ready but not 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.810
 is and ojito with pereira 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.840
 this is fatigue gentlemen this is the 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.140
 fatigue 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.940
 silver bronze locate pereira 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.880
 it hurts with his who has finished fifth 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.190
 he's finished shattered he could not 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.170
 more and here not 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.160
 you have to applaud your courage you have to 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.430
 applaud 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.220
 your test show your generosity 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.440
 in the effort you have to applaud everything 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.440
 julia but but the coast
