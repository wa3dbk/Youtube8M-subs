00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.109
 without a doubt when it is a beautiful 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.210

 that these righteous beauties charge 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
 life, we have to recognize that until 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.380
 At the moment there are very good adaptations like 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.900
 is the case of the black widow 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.030

 satisfied is one of the adaptations 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.660
 who came closest to the original character 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 thanks to scarlett although we did not 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.410
 would bother us if the producers of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 marvel decided to improve yourself a bit 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.700
 suit we could also see the woman 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.890
 invisible wife of the scientist reed 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.659

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.619
 well with your task of representing this 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.509
 emblematic character but also 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.759
 we saw adaptations that were moving away a 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.040
 little of what was known in the comics 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.080
 as is the case of theft of the x-men 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.060
 who in the world of comics 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.680
 shows as a mature woman to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.840
 comparison of the adaptation of the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.060
 very sensual character there are already many 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.220
 adaptations that we saw or are ready 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.289
 to see but just as there are already many 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.660

 inexplicably attracted to him 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.430
