00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
stickers so let's all put that to the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.010 
stickers so let's all put that to the
one<00:02:06.420> side<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.179> see<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.360> else<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.660> get<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
one side and see what else we get in the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.640 
one side and see what else we get in the
box<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.560> there's<00:02:10.800> quite<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> few<00:02:11.069> cables<00:02:12.200> as

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
box so there's quite a few cables as

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
box so there's quite a few cables as
so<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> wrist<00:02:14.999> strap<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.109> was

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
so this is the wrist strap that I was

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.869 
so this is the wrist strap that I was
talking<00:02:16.469> about<00:02:16.530> before<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.400> basically

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
talking about before so this basically

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.750 
talking about before so this basically
you<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.139> press<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:22.310> okay<00:02:23.310> press<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
you just press this in okay press the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.319 
you just press this in okay press the
end<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.209> then<00:02:24.859> line<00:02:25.859> it<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.129> with<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.090> round

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
end and then line it up with the round

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.599 
end and then line it up with the round
and<00:02:27.780> lock<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.139> into<00:02:28.230> place<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.459> let

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
and lock it into place and you can let

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.160 
and lock it into place and you can let
it<00:02:29.639> hang<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.269> know<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.780> put<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.109> on

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
convenient for like carrying it and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.800 
convenient for like carrying it and
taking<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.849> out<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.060> about<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.510> stuff<00:02:36.689> like

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810

taking it out and about and stuff like
that<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.439> then<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.069> take<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.519> just<00:02:38.549> sort

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
that and then to take it out just sort

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.709 
that and then to take it out just sort
of<00:02:39.000> line<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.389> with<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.750> circle<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.450> sort<00:02:42.450> of

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
of line up with the circle and sort of

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.580 
of line up with the circle and sort of
if<00:02:43.019> we<00:02:43.169> can<00:02:43.280> take<00:02:44.280> off<00:02:44.459> okay<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.959> then<00:02:46.349> push

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
if we can take off okay and then push

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.440 
if we can take off okay and then push
this<00:02:46.739> back<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.159> alright<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.120> then<00:02:48.239> also

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
this back in alright and then also

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.720 
this back in alright and then also
you've<00:02:48.750> obviously<00:02:48.870> got<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.319> new<00:02:49.730> lightning

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you've obviously got the new lightning

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.879 
you've obviously got the new lightning
cables<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:51.569> this<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.169> lightning<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> it

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
cables so this is the lightning and it

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.159 
cables so this is the lightning and it
is<00:02:53.040> reversible<00:02:53.579> let's<00:02:54.480> give<00:02:54.659> you<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> close-up

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
is reversible let's give you a close-up

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.360 
is reversible let's give you a close-up
of<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.349> if<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> camera<00:02:55.919> wants<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.219> focus

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
of that if the camera wants to focus

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.830 
of that if the camera wants to focus
yeah<00:02:57.150> there<00:02:57.449> you<00:02:57.510> go

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
yeah there you go

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
yeah there you go
and<00:02:58.439> obviously<00:02:58.859> is<00:02:59.099> reversible<00:02:59.730> so<00:02:59.909> it<00:02:59.969> goes

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and obviously is reversible so it goes

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.330 
and obviously is reversible so it goes
in<00:03:00.239> either<00:03:00.419> way<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.829> USB<00:03:02.069> part

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
in either way and this is the USB part

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.619 
in either way and this is the USB part
that<00:03:02.549> will<00:03:02.669> go<00:03:02.790> into<00:03:02.879> your<00:03:03.030> computer<00:03:03.449> and

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
that will go into your computer and

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.990 
that will go into your computer and
there's<00:03:04.319> no<00:03:04.439> water<00:03:04.680> included<00:03:05.489> with<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.699> iPod

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
there's no water included with the iPod

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.129 
there's no water included with the iPod
touch<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.359> have<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.629> charge<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.079> a

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
touch so you have to charge it with a

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.409 
touch so you have to charge it with a
computer<00:03:07.650> or<00:03:07.889> unless<00:03:08.699> you<00:03:08.819> buy<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.030> separate

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
computer or unless you buy the separate

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.599 
computer or unless you buy the separate
wall<00:03:09.540> charger<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.079> plug<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.409> in<00:03:10.620> but

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
wall charger and then plug this in but

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.039 
wall charger and then plug this in but
let's<00:03:11.849> just<00:03:11.939> put<00:03:12.090> all<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.569> side<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
let's just put all that to the side and

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.470 
let's just put all that to the side and
then<00:03:13.199> obviously<00:03:13.530> you've<00:03:13.919> got<00:03:13.949> the<00:03:14.400> new<00:03:15.209> ear

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
then obviously you've got the new ear

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.990 
then obviously you've got the new ear
points<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:16.980> come<00:03:17.189> they're<00:03:17.759> not<00:03:17.790> as

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
points so they come they're not as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.580 
points so they come they're not as
nicely<00:03:18.239> packaged<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.019> with<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.259> iPhone

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
nicely packaged as like with the iPhone

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.439 
nicely packaged as like with the iPhone
or<00:03:19.739> if<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.919> buy<00:03:20.069> them<00:03:20.220> separately<00:03:20.489> but<00:03:21.389> you

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
or if you buy them separately but you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.039 
or if you buy them separately but you
can<00:03:21.810> still<00:03:22.879> access<00:03:23.879> them<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.449> to<00:03:24.509> take<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> out

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
can still access them so to take it out

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.140 
can still access them so to take it out
you<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:25.259> lift<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.979> and<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.849> can<00:03:26.879> see

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
you just lift this up and you can see

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.689 
you just lift this up and you can see
the<00:03:27.299> sort<00:03:27.479> of<00:03:27.509> like<00:03:27.689> wrapped<00:03:27.930> around<00:03:28.079> in<00:03:28.379> here

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
the sort of like wrapped around in here

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:34.219 
the sort of like wrapped around in here
so<00:03:29.699> let's<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.209> take<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.419> out<00:03:30.689> and<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.109> can

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
so let's just take it out and so you can

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.539 
so let's just take it out and so you can
actually<00:03:34.500> use<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.739> as<00:03:34.889> like<00:03:35.009> a<00:03:35.069> convenient

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
actually use this as like a convenient

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.460 
actually use this as like a convenient

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
lightweight

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.210 
lightweight
if<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.180> get<00:05:10.360> my<00:05:10.480> third<00:05:10.750> gen<00:05:11.080> okay<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:12.010> third

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
if I get my third gen okay so a third

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.970 
if I get my third gen okay so a third
gen<00:05:12.430> on<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.670> right<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.350> fifth<00:05:14.350> gen<00:05:14.650> on<00:05:14.860> the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.680 
gen on the right and fifth gen on the
left<00:05:15.220> so<00:05:15.700> you<00:05:15.760> can<00:05:15.910> obviously<00:05:16.000> see<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.420> size

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
left so you can obviously see the size

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.480 
left so you can obviously see the size
difference<00:05:16.720> so<00:05:17.350> this<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.770> four<00:05:18.040> inch<00:05:18.070> and

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
difference so this is a four inch and

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.730 
difference so this is a four inch and
this<00:05:18.580> is<00:05:18.700> not<00:05:18.880> Retina<00:05:19.180> display<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:20.500> fourth

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
this is not Retina display the fourth

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.230 
this is not Retina display the fourth
gen<00:05:20.920> also<00:05:21.190> had<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> Retina<00:05:21.640> display<00:05:21.970> but<00:05:22.000> this

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
gen also had a Retina display but this

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.420 
gen also had a Retina display but this
is<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.510> exact<00:05:22.780> same<00:05:22.930> display<00:05:23.320> as<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.950> iPhone

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
is the exact same display as the iPhone

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.230 
is the exact same display as the iPhone
5<00:05:24.670> 1<00:05:25.090> 1<00:05:25.270> 3<00:05:25.420> 6<00:05:25.720> by<00:05:25.900> 640<00:05:26.500> pixels<00:05:27.010> IPS<00:05:27.880> Retina

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
5 1 1 3 6 by 640 pixels IPS Retina

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.840 
5 1 1 3 6 by 640 pixels IPS Retina
display<00:05:28.540> four<00:05:28.810> inches<00:05:29.050> as<00:05:29.200> I<00:05:29.290> said<00:05:29.700> so<00:05:30.700> yeah

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
display four inches as I said so yeah

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.159 
display four inches as I said so yeah
initial<00:05:31.210> impressions<00:05:31.600> if<00:05:31.720> those<00:05:31.870> are<00:05:31.990> like

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
initial impressions if those are like

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.010 
initial impressions if those are like
lot<00:05:32.680> lighter<00:05:32.890> than<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.190> third<00:05:33.490> gen<00:05:34.020> obviously

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
lot lighter than the third gen obviously

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.950 
lot lighter than the third gen obviously
they've<00:05:35.290> gone<00:05:35.500> they've<00:05:35.919> got<00:05:36.100> rid<00:05:36.220> of<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.490> like

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
they've gone they've got rid of the like

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.150 
they've gone they've got rid of the like
shiny<00:05:37.960> aluminium<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.560> covered<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.919> brushed

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
shiny aluminium and covered the brushed

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.950 
shiny aluminium and covered the brushed
aluminium<00:05:39.310> so<00:05:40.120> I<00:05:40.180> think<00:05:40.240> it'll<00:05:40.540> work<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.720> lot

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
aluminium so I think it'll work a lot

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.340 
aluminium so I think it'll work a lot
better<00:05:42.330> so<00:05:43.330> yeah<00:05:43.480> stay<00:05:43.750> tuned<00:05:44.020> for<00:05:44.200> more

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
better so yeah stay tuned for more

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.200 
better so yeah stay tuned for more

comparison<00:05:50.110> with<00:05:50.230> the<00:05:50.350> third<00:05:50.590> gen<00:05:50.830> like<00:05:50.980> if

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
comparison with the third gen like if

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.590 
comparison with the third gen like if
you<00:05:51.220> want<00:05:51.400> a<00:05:51.460> full<00:05:51.640> comparison<00:05:52.210> with<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.390> 3rd

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
you want a full comparison with the 3rd

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.260 
you want a full comparison with the 3rd
gen<00:05:52.900> then<00:05:53.560> let<00:05:54.340> me<00:05:54.430> know<00:05:54.460> by<00:05:54.760> liking<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.180> video

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
gen then let me know by liking the video

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.300 
gen then let me know by liking the video
leaving<00:05:55.720> a<00:05:55.810> comment<00:05:56.020> because<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.980> thing<00:05:57.190> is

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
leaving a comment because the thing is

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.130 
leaving a comment because the thing is
for<00:05:57.490> me<00:05:57.550> like<00:05:57.880> if<00:05:58.090> you've<00:05:58.240> got<00:05:58.419> a<00:05:58.450> 4th<00:05:58.690> gen<00:05:58.960> and

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
for me like if you've got a 4th gen and

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.990 
for me like if you've got a 4th gen and
there's<00:05:59.320> no<00:05:59.440> real<00:05:59.680> reason<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.040> upgrade<00:06:00.250> but

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
there's no real reason to upgrade but

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.490 
there's no real reason to upgrade but
obviously<00:06:01.360> from<00:06:01.540> a<00:06:01.630> 3rd<00:06:01.840> gen<00:06:02.050> there's<00:06:02.260> a<00:06:02.320> big

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
obviously from a 3rd gen there's a big

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.870 
obviously from a 3rd gen there's a big
reason<00:06:02.680> and<00:06:03.100> the<00:06:03.280> main<00:06:03.460> reason<00:06:03.490> would

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
reason and the main reason would

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.159 
reason and the main reason would
obviously<00:06:04.090> be<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.419> Retina<00:06:04.690> display<00:06:04.990> in<00:06:05.050> the

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
obviously be the Retina display in the

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.260 
obviously be the Retina display in the
camera<00:06:05.470> because<00:06:05.770> this<00:06:06.370> one<00:06:06.580> has<00:06:06.610> neither<00:06:06.940> the

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
camera because this one has neither the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.570 
camera because this one has neither the
third<00:06:07.540> gen<00:06:07.780> so<00:06:08.470> I<00:06:08.860> will<00:06:09.100> be<00:06:09.220> doing<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.460> full

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
third gen so I will be doing a full

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.980 
third gen so I will be doing a full
comparison<00:06:09.880> with<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.390> if<00:06:10.510> you<00:06:10.600> guys<00:06:10.720> want

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
comparison with that if you guys want

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.470 
comparison with that if you guys want
that<00:06:11.169> so<00:06:11.380> again<00:06:11.590> leave<00:06:12.070> a<00:06:12.100> like<00:06:12.310> rating<00:06:12.580> or<00:06:13.450> a

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.409 
support so let's just see let's just go
through<00:06:27.040> the<00:06:27.280> cell<00:06:27.520> and<00:06:27.880> it<00:06:28.030> will<00:06:28.120> probably<00:06:28.240> be

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
through the cell and it will probably be

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.240 
through the cell and it will probably be
the<00:06:28.570> same<00:06:28.750> sort<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.080> iOS<00:06:29.470> 6<00:06:29.710> up<00:06:29.890> so<00:06:30.100> I'm<00:06:30.160> not

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
the same sort of iOS 6 up so I'm not

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.740 
the same sort of iOS 6 up so I'm not
going<00:06:30.400> to<00:06:30.460> go<00:06:30.580> through<00:06:30.790> that<00:06:30.910> but<00:06:31.390> you<00:06:31.479> can<00:06:31.600> get

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
going to go through that but you can get

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.840 
going to go through that but you can get
a<00:06:31.780> quick<00:06:31.990> look<00:06:32.140> at<00:06:32.289> the<00:06:32.380> display<00:06:32.710> here<00:06:32.950> so<00:06:33.220> this

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
a quick look at the display here so this

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.090 
a quick look at the display here so this
is<00:06:34.030> really<00:06:34.390> clear<00:06:34.620> let's<00:06:35.620> bring<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:35.919> a<00:06:35.950> bit

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
is really clear let's bring it a bit

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.090 
is really clear let's bring it a bit
closer<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.460> camera

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
closer to camera

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.460 
closer to camera
yeah<00:06:37.340> so<00:06:37.610> this<00:06:37.730> is<00:06:37.790> the<00:06:37.940> exact<00:06:38.390> same<00:06:38.600> display

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
yeah so this is the exact same display

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.950 
yeah so this is the exact same display
as<00:06:39.680> the<00:06:39.830> iPhone<00:06:40.130> 5<00:06:40.370> so<00:06:41.270> it's<00:06:41.510> obviously<00:06:41.840> very

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
as the iPhone 5 so it's obviously very

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.040 
as the iPhone 5 so it's obviously very
high<00:06:42.320> resolution<00:06:43.300> for<00:06:44.300> those<00:06:44.450> of<00:06:44.600> you<00:06:44.720> quickly

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
high resolution for those of you quickly

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.170 
high resolution for those of you quickly
sort<00:06:45.290> of<00:06:45.380> wondering<00:06:45.680> why<00:06:45.890> I<00:06:46.190> won<00:06:46.730> with<00:06:46.850> an<00:06:46.940> iPod

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
sort of wondering why I won with an iPod

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.730 
sort of wondering why I won with an iPod
Touch<00:06:47.390> when<00:06:47.570> I'm<00:06:47.660> such<00:06:47.840> a<00:06:47.870> big<00:06:48.110> Android<00:06:48.500> fan

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
Touch when I'm such a big Android fan

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.440 
Touch when I'm such a big Android fan
well<00:06:48.980> it<00:06:49.190> allows<00:06:49.460> me<00:06:49.640> to<00:06:49.670> experience<00:06:50.030> iOS

stuff<00:06:58.280> like<00:06:58.400> that<00:06:58.550> like<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:58.940> iPod<00:06:59.240> is<00:06:59.470> App

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
stuff like that like the iPod is App

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.710 
stuff like that like the iPod is App
Store<00:07:00.860> I<00:07:01.070> will<00:07:01.760> admit<00:07:02.030> that<00:07:02.060> the<00:07:02.330> App<00:07:02.420> Store<00:07:02.630> is

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.600 
Store I will admit that the App Store is
a<00:07:02.750> lot<00:07:02.960> better<00:07:03.080> than<00:07:03.230> on<00:07:03.440> Android<00:07:03.830> so<00:07:03.860> this

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
a lot better than on Android so this

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.460 
a lot better than on Android so this
allows<00:07:04.880> me<00:07:05.060> a<00:07:05.090> chance<00:07:05.360> to<00:07:05.540> experience<00:07:06.020> iOS
