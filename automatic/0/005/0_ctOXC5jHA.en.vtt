renaissance<00:00:30.539> man<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.050> technology<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.679> guess<00:00:31.890> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
renaissance man of technology I guess so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
renaissance man of technology I guess so
yeah<00:00:32.489> maybe<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.540> did<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.170> start

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
yeah maybe so how did you get your start

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.549 
yeah maybe so how did you get your start
in<00:00:35.270> feel<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> you're<00:00:36.510> doing<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.170> i

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
in feel that you're doing right now i

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
in feel that you're doing right now i
discovered<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.340> community<00:00:38.850> online

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
discovered this community online

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180 
discovered this community online
especially<00:00:39.629> through<00:00:40.050> flash<00:00:40.320> people<00:00:40.860> writing

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
especially through flash people writing

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.069 
especially through flash people writing
code<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> animate<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> i<00:00:42.420> had<00:00:42.600> always<00:00:42.750> loved

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
code to animate and i had always loved

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
code to animate and i had always loved
animation<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.059> for<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.600> really

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
animation and for me it was just really

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.529 
animation and for me it was just really
beautiful<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:47.010> idea<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.640> could<00:00:47.820> write

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
beautiful this idea that you could write

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.819 
beautiful this idea that you could write
some<00:00:48.750> lines<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.140> code<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.649> see

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
some lines of code and then see

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.170 
some lines of code and then see
something<00:00:50.160> move<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.059> make

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
something move and then you can make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.770 
something move and then you can make
really<00:00:51.750> elegant<00:00:52.020> touch<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.530> lotion<00:00:53.780> one

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
really elegant touch with lotion one

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
really elegant touch with lotion one
thing<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.170> involved<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.039> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
thing that I'm involved with now is is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.650 
thing that I'm involved with now is is
an<00:00:56.610> open<00:00:56.879> source<00:00:57.030> project<00:00:57.149> called

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
an open source project called

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.319 
an open source project called
openframeworks<00:00:58.020> which<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> C++<00:00:59.370> toolkit<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
openframeworks which is a C++ toolkit so

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.560 
openframeworks which is a C++ toolkit so
I'm<00:01:00.780> before<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.770> sort<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.039> nerd<00:01:02.250> artist<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.940> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I'm before I'm sort of nerd artist I you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.539 
I'm before I'm sort of nerd artist I you
know<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.870> write<00:01:04.080> software<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.369> sort<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
know we write software we just sort of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.460 
know we write software we just sort of
low-level<00:01:05.880> hacking<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.140> making<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
low-level hacking and this is making a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.520 
low-level hacking and this is making a
tool<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.740> other<00:01:08.040> people<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.229> stuff

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
tool for other people to to make stuff

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
tool for other people to to make stuff
with<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.280> each<00:01:11.460> individual<00:01:12.270> use<00:01:12.600> you're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
with for each individual use you're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
with for each individual use you're
creating<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> brand<00:01:13.530> new<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.100> software

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
creating a brand new kind of software

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
creating a brand new kind of software
yeah<00:01:15.360> every<00:01:15.869> time<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.619> new<00:01:16.740> problem

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
yeah every time we have a new problem

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
yeah every time we have a new problem
the<00:01:17.400> magician<00:01:17.700> comes<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> says<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> want<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the magician comes in says you want to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
the magician comes in says you want to
do<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> meant<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.409> reality<00:01:19.830> card<00:01:20.700> trick<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
do it meant in reality card trick and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.370 
do it meant in reality card trick and
then<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.540> okay<00:01:21.810> let's<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> new

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
then it's like okay let's make a new

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.260 
then it's like okay let's make a new
software<00:01:22.740> about<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
software about it you know how to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.210 
software about it you know how to
retrack<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> playing<00:01:25.020> card<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.040> new

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
retrack a playing card we have a new

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.980 
retrack a playing card we have a new
problem<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.939> come<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.299> software

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
problem and we come up with software

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.090 
problem and we come up with software
solver<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.270> saw<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.020> cool<00:01:31.140> video<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
solver so I saw a really cool video I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.140 
solver so I saw a really cool video I
think<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> uses<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> open<00:01:34.799> framework

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
think that it uses the open framework

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.359 
think that it uses the open framework
software<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> car<00:01:36.810> yeah<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.829> project<00:01:38.250> was

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
software with a car yeah the project was

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
software with a car yeah the project was
in<00:01:38.579> Belgium<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:39.810> an<00:01:39.960> advertising

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
in Belgium and it was an advertising

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.160 
in Belgium and it was an advertising
company<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> Toyota<00:01:42.329> account<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
company that has the Toyota account and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.749 
company that has the Toyota account and
then<00:01:43.350> once<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:43.979> had<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> idea<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.520> driving

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
then once they had the idea of driving

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.330 
then once they had the idea of driving
and<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> making<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> typeface<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.860> contacted

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and and making a typeface they contacted

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
and and making a typeface they contacted
me<00:01:47.520> through<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.270> needed<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> use

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
me through that they needed to use

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.859 
me through that they needed to use
software<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.460> real-time<00:01:50.670> software<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
software kind of real-time software in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.389 
software kind of real-time software in
order<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.259> track<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> car<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> good

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
order to track the car to get a good

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.190 
order to track the car to get a good
sense<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> outcome<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.600> they

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
sense of what the outcome would be they

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
sense of what the outcome would be they
did<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:55.500> experiments<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
did some experiments here with kind of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.580 
did some experiments here with kind of
imagining<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.899> paper<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> movements

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
imagining on paper what the movements

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.200 
imagining on paper what the movements
the<00:02:00.039> driver<00:02:00.340> would<00:02:00.670> then<00:02:00.820> take<00:02:01.000> those

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the driver would then take those

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.060 
the driver would then take those
drawings<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.780> try<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.929> interpret<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.560> draw<00:02:02.859> he

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070

drawings and try to interpret it draw he
would<00:02:03.189> drive<00:02:03.340> slowly<00:02:03.670> at<00:02:03.909> first<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.420> then<00:02:04.570> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
would drive slowly at first and then and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.480 
would drive slowly at first and then and
then<00:02:05.289> drive<00:02:05.469> faster<00:02:05.859> because<00:02:06.039> some<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
then drive faster because some of the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.219 
then drive faster because some of the
things<00:02:06.729> are<00:02:06.880> really<00:02:07.119> involved<00:02:07.420> wipeouts<00:02:07.899> when

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
things are really involved wipeouts when

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.529 
things are really involved wipeouts when
I<00:02:08.560> software<00:02:09.009> outputted<00:02:09.519> an<00:02:09.640> image<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.420> then

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
I software outputted an image and then

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.630 
I software outputted an image and then
the<00:02:10.660> font<00:02:10.899> designers<00:02:11.379> took<00:02:12.129> that<00:02:12.340> image

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the font designers took that image

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610 
the font designers took that image
traced<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.569> cleaned<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.989> up<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.200> bit<00:02:14.230> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
traced it and cleaned it up a bit and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.619 
traced it and cleaned it up a bit and
then<00:02:14.830> made<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> phone<00:02:20.849> we're<00:02:21.849> making<00:02:22.120> an<00:02:22.209> eye

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
then made the phone we're making an eye

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.750 
then made the phone we're making an eye

eye<00:02:33.010> ok<00:02:33.700> let's<00:02:33.910> hook<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.599> up<00:02:35.910> we're<00:02:36.910> actually

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
eye ok let's hook this up we're actually

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.240 
eye ok let's hook this up we're actually
tracking<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.660> pupil<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.560> as<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.950> people

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
tracking the pupil so as the people

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.640 
tracking the pupil so as the people
moves<00:02:39.430> around<00:02:39.810> we're<00:02:40.810> following<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.560> we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
moves around we're following it so we

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.080 
moves around we're following it so we
write<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:42.280> know<00:02:42.370> using<00:02:42.730> openframeworks

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
write you know using openframeworks

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.479 
write you know using openframeworks
write<00:02:43.660> some<00:02:43.810> code<00:02:43.989> in<00:02:44.230> order<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.530> find<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
write some code in order to find it and

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.100 
write some code in order to find it and
fitting<00:02:45.790> an<00:02:45.879> ellipse<00:02:46.180> through<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:46.930> there's

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
fitting an ellipse through it so there's

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.869 
fitting an ellipse through it so there's
a<00:02:47.170> data<00:02:47.560> coming<00:02:47.799> from<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.099> camera<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.730> then

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
a data coming from the camera and then

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.180 
a data coming from the camera and then
we<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.599> some<00:02:49.840> illumination<00:02:50.440> from<00:02:50.860> these

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
we have some illumination from these

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.930 
we have some illumination from these
infrared<00:02:51.910> LEDs<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:53.110> eye<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.470> really<00:02:53.739> good

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
infrared LEDs your eye is a really good

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.789 
infrared LEDs your eye is a really good
input<00:02:54.940> device<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> great<00:02:56.140> output<00:02:56.530> device

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
input device is on a great output device

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.470 
input device is on a great output device
and<00:02:57.099> when<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.640> actually<00:02:57.790> start<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.150> hook<00:02:58.360> it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
and when you actually start to hook it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.479 
and when you actually start to hook it
up<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.629> draw<00:02:59.019> it's<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.530> little<00:02:59.829> bit<00:02:59.950> tricky<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
up to draw it's a little bit tricky and

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.950 
up to draw it's a little bit tricky and
so

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
so

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.870 
so
we<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.800> do<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.950> lot<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> work<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.670> make<00:03:03.850> it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
we have to do a lot of work to make it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.640 
we have to do a lot of work to make it
easy<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.570> ourselves<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.110> then<00:03:05.260> also<00:03:05.380> easy

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
easy for ourselves and then also easy

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.890 
easy for ourselves and then also easy
for<00:03:05.890> attacks<00:03:06.130> it's<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.640> all<00:03:06.880> tempting<00:03:07.510> gusta

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
for attacks it's it's all tempting gusta

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.550 
for attacks it's it's all tempting gusta
communicate<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:10.050> guess<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.080> just<00:03:11.140> takes<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
communicate I guess I just takes a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.990 
communicate I guess I just takes a
little<00:03:11.710> bit<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.040> learning<00:03:12.190> curve<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
little bit of a learning curve it's a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.750 
little bit of a learning curve it's a
little<00:03:13.300> quirky<00:03:13.870> right<00:03:14.260> now<00:03:14.440> oh<00:03:14.650> yeah<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.610> just

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
little quirky right now oh yeah I just

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.450 
little quirky right now oh yeah I just
crossed<00:03:16.180> my<00:03:16.330> on<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.750> weirdest<00:03:20.170> thing<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:21.220> um

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
crossed my on the weirdest thing so um
