00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
internet and it's very hard to find

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.760 
internet and it's very hard to find
anything<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> Mac<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:16.020> complements

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.930 
not the Mac the little desk underneath
the<00:00:39.149> floating<00:00:39.809> desk<00:00:40.460> was<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> actual

young<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:26.079> think<00:02:27.079> it<00:02:27.170> complements<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.709> Mac

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
young I think it complements the Mac

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.129 
young I think it complements the Mac
just<00:02:28.489> right<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:28.939> it<00:02:29.060> doesn't<00:02:29.239> doesn't<00:02:29.840> stick

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:30.139 
just right in it doesn't doesn't stick

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.649 
just right in it doesn't doesn't stick
