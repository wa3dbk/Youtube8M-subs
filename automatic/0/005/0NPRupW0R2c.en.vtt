00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.460
 since mid-May to widensolen des 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 engineering nurseries gilbert de sigolsheim 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 undertook the planting of vines if 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 the location is surprising 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.139
 choice results from family land 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.910
 available from a floor suitable for works 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.500
 implantation and maintenance of plants 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.070
 vineyard but also constraints 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.060
 health 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.019
 you have to be separated from the vineyards that are 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.630
 existing mileage 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.670
 so it's land in neutral zone 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.149
 and it is in will require some 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.460
 surface what to plant so there we have 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.010
 a total area of ​​15 hectares 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 place and in plants now this cat 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 hectares of nurseries so does a 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 rotation that lasts 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
 every time we do not have the right to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.800
 return to the fields 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 the year after so that's the minimum 5 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 years a rotation when the light soil is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.120
 rather sandy and previously 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 prepared by a local farmer 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 then start classifying is connected to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 a watering system by 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.719
 drip are installed at 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.250
 regular intervals allowing access 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.809
 tractors and sprayers in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 according to the size of the stems of plans 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 to produce in total for this year this 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.710
 are some 7500 plans that are going to be 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.470
 planted manually by line knowing 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 that 160 lines were installed there one 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 is planting the plans that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.710
 were grafted last month so 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 if it's about planting the plans for the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 season after next season so 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 subject to nursery until the month 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.200
 of October for a favor the roots 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.400
 have the root development and the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 case at the transplant 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.579
 the planting although manual has nothing 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.380
 complex 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.450
 just make sure to push the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.159
 plan deep enough and the most straight 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.079
 possible in holes already punched 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.549
 in the plastic tarpaulin but let's go back 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.960
 now the two month time for 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.960
 go back to the youth of his plans 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 right now it's the operation of 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.179
 grafting that is done so that's 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.509
 the main operation of our profession 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.789
 it consists in assembling the graft so 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.159
 an Alsatian variety with a door 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.200
 to an American variety that is 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.140
 phylloxera resistant then the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.600
 graft it comes 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.720
 plots Alsatian so it's 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.760
 somewhat specific plots that during 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.680
 12 years have had grapevine has it's 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.170
 basic material or there the nurserymen 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 can recover the woods to make 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.580
 so new vine plants for 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.770
 the rootstock so a part comes 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.730
 of our own production has little 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.510
 nearly 30% 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.600
 so we have a field of s locked a field 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.640
 3309 elders madex of the 34 she and the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.690
 remains so it's doors to serious 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.260
 who are bought 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.850
 in France in the Ardèche mainly 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.350
 it's an omega transplant that has to 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.350
 its name to its shape reminiscent of that of the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.400
 Greek letter made mechanically 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.230
 the operation asks to choose a door 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.030
 graft and a griffin of the same caliber 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.390
 for it to be in the manner of a 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.900
 puzzle 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.360
 so once the transplant done 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.570
 Password future mine plan in the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.610
 paraffin to protect the cut is 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.910
 so this eminent breaks up to prepare 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.410
 stratification so be like these 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.690
 facts behind we put in breaks 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.700
 with sawdust is working 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.370
 also sometimes from stratification to 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.020
 water or so with peat so 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.350
 the three methods are possible and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.150
 often we alternate the three 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.010
 plans once by refined and cashed 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.050
 are placed in a cold room until 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.300
 early May then they came out and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.100
 placed in a hot room at 25 degrees with 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.080
 high humidity between ten and fifteen 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.150
 days to promote stratification 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.740
 ie scarring of the point 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.500
 of transplant and the appearance of the first 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.540
 root system often work the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.700
 nursery it is of course these seasonal 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.140
 but every six to eight weeks we 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.940
 change of work so now we are 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.470
 on the grafting operation that will last 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.180
 between six and eight weeks to spend 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.520
 all of our production 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.110
 and as soon as we finish we start 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.209
 heats up so it will last a fortnight 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.190
 of days and as soon as this one is also 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.890
 finished so we go to nursery and we 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.600
 plant is like that we have cycles of 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.709
 two months later until the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.000
 complete fabrication of your guide plan 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.590
 this nursery produces seedlings 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.120
 vine of three different sizes of 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.100
 traditional plants for the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.290
 plantation in general 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.940
 50 cm half-stem plans intended 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.310
 mainly to a location in 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.470
 terrace and finally plans to the rods of 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.570
 80 cm mainly dedicated to the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.310
 complantation between different 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.200
 grape varieties and the various door 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.100
 available grafts and counting these 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.750
 three sizes of stems 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.300
 the company is able to offer 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.669
 nearly 200 different assemblies all 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.680
 planted in widensolen and 80% of which 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.880
 Alsacian grape varieties in the space of three 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.990
 weeks they will start pushing 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.820
 so they will do both three 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 first leaves and then we go 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.270
 perform a first treatment on the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.320
 foliage to protect against mildew 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.320
 powdery mildew 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.600
 and it will grow relatively slowly 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.970
 at the beginning and then once the callus 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.320
 of the transplant is sufficiently taken and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.070
 as the first roots grows 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.590
 at ground level 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.600
 then we bring watering is a 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.120
 little fertilizer so it'll grow 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.310
 relatively slowly we will not 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.720
 hurry either and it will follow his 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.370
 course what until October 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.230
 and then it's going to be trimmed it's going to be 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.600
 treated like yves signed normal what all 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.220
 throughout the busy drawing once 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.510
 these past five months the plans are so 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.400
 mechanically ripped off to be 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.900
 reported on the sigolsheim site where 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.700
 they will be carefully sorted by a 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.140
 specially trained team this 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.410
 new stage lasts between six and eight 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.410
 weeks 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.500
 so to sort a plan correctly we 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.290
 must check if the welding call that 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.430
 is there after the omega graft is 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.670
 properly welded 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.190
 so for that we make two pressures 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.680
 on the vine at both places 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.840
 the most sensitive on the plane that does not 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.570
 are not the mega then on it and we 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.790
 see if there is no opening 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.140
 if there is no opening it is that the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.270
 strike went well and that the 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.710
 healing is good so that's 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.010
 a very important step 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.930
 then we check that the wood is 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.440
 sufficient size and has correctly 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.840
 added 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.030
 and then we verify the implantation 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.950
 root a beautiful plan c a plan with 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.890
 many roots correctly 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.480
 distributed and the more he has roots and 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.940
 the more you have to reserve in 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.500
 the plan then we check one last 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.990
 thing is that there is no good of 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.460
 injuries especially the rootstock the 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.080
 retained plans after sorting because 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.670
 afterwards by the cutting phase or 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.380
 first person compared to the branch 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.730
 that he considers the least good before 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.260
 that a second person do not cut the 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.840
 wood remaining above the second 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.270
 buds and it's this step for me 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.240
 which is worth a good quality of seedlings 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.790
 vine a good yard already for for 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.230
 know how to sort 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.530
 vineyards at home I train the staff 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.510
 two years I want him to have seen a stage 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.930
 whole production of a vine 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.090
 18 months which includes totally ben the 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.940
 physiology of the plant before sorting 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.420
 and that's where we can do the 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.060
 difference 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.250
 in total about 700 thousand 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.930
 vine plants that will be sorted 40% 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.490
 will end up in the trash a percentage 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.620
 equivalent to the national average 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.540
 genil gilbert nurseries employs 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.100
 five permanent year round and between seven 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.800
 and fifteen seasonal for a duration 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.840
 ranging from three to eight months 80% of the 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.030
 production is regionally elapsed the 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.390
 rest is destined for the French market 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.390
 German and Swiss
