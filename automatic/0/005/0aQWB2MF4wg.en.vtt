00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
available at a decent price as well you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
available at a decent price as well you
know<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.040> other<00:01:20.130> Angry<00:01:20.430> Birds<00:01:20.610> games<00:01:20.850> came<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
know the other Angry Birds games came to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.610 
know the other Angry Birds games came to
us<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.350> $4.99<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:24.290> turn<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
us at I think $4.99 so turn that down a

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.100 
us at I think $4.99 so turn that down a
little<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.820> came<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> us<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.240> $4.99<00:01:27.870> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
little bit they came to us at $4.99 and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.630 
little bit they came to us at $4.99 and
this<00:01:28.200> would<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.590> keep<00:01:28.710> those<00:01:28.830> at<00:01:29.040> $2.99

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
this would actually keep those at $2.99

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
this would actually keep those at $2.99
so<00:01:30.050> it's<00:01:31.050> still<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.440> bit<00:01:31.560> more

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
so it's still a little bit more

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
so it's still a little bit more
expensive<00:01:32.130> than<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:33.200> competitive<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> know

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
expensive than the competitive you know

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
expensive than the competitive you know
the<00:01:34.470> competitors<00:01:34.950> tablets<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.820> stuff<00:01:35.970> like

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the competitors tablets and stuff like

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.680 
the competitors tablets and stuff like
that<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.540> still<00:01:37.580> relatively<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.940> decent<00:01:39.510> price

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
that but still relatively a decent price

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.770 
that but still relatively a decent price

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.750 
favor and I nailed it definitely
probably<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.400> starters<00:02:17.850> let's<00:02:18.090> see

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
probably have for starters let's see

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.000 
probably have for starters let's see
come<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.959> four<00:02:22.410> stars

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.729 

yes<00:02:26.330> doesn't<00:02:27.330> happen<00:02:27.450> often<00:02:27.750> usually<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.380> get

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
yes doesn't happen often usually I get

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.590 
yes doesn't happen often usually I get
one<00:02:28.920> star<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.550> leave<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.880> uh<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.090> god<00:02:30.269> okay

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
one star and I leave it uh my god okay

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.960 
one star and I leave it uh my god okay
it's<00:02:30.720> good<00:02:30.870> enough<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:32.010> new<00:02:32.400> high<00:02:32.550> records

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
it's good enough but new high records

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.190 
it's good enough but new high records
because<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.570> first<00:02:33.810> time<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:34.019> playing

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
because it's the first time I'm playing

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.530 
because it's the first time I'm playing
it<00:02:34.290> let's<00:02:34.470> give<00:02:34.769> one<00:02:34.800> more<00:02:35.040> level<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.519> try<00:02:35.760> you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it let's give one more level a try you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.190 
it let's give one more level a try you
can<00:02:36.660> zoom<00:02:36.840> out<00:02:37.050> zoom<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.100> said<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can zoom out zoom in like I said and it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.910 
can zoom out zoom in like I said and it
is<00:02:40.230> very<00:02:40.680> very<00:02:40.890> smooth<00:02:42.680> probably<00:02:43.680> not<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
is very very smooth probably not the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
is very very smooth probably not the
best<00:02:43.950> move<00:02:44.280> there<00:02:44.459> Oh<00:02:46.489> possibly<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.030> best

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
best move there Oh possibly the best

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.800 
best move there Oh possibly the best
move<00:02:48.750> actually<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.730> big<00:02:54.060> differentiating

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
move actually so the big differentiating

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.449 
move actually so the big differentiating
factor<00:02:55.170> between<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.590> version<00:02:55.799> Angry<00:02:56.220> Birds

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
factor between this version Angry Birds

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.340 
factor between this version Angry Birds
and<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.150> other<00:02:57.299> versions<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.110> is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and the other versions that we have is

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.699 
and the other versions that we have is
that<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.760> with<00:02:59.790> physics<00:03:00.709> they

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
that it's all to do with physics they

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.620 
that it's all to do with physics they
worked<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:01.980> closely<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.489> NASA<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
worked really closely with NASA to to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
worked really closely with NASA to to
understand<00:03:03.989> how<00:03:04.230> everything<00:03:04.380> works<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.070> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
understand how everything works and to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.699 
understand how everything works and to
get<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.489> actually<00:03:06.000> accurate<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
get it actually accurate and and the

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.580 
get it actually accurate and and the
thing<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.400> are<00:03:08.430> using<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:10.230> physics

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
thing is that you are using the physics

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.650 
thing is that you are using the physics
of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.950> planet<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:12.120> gravitational

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
of the planet and the the gravitational

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.020 
of the planet and the the gravitational
pull<00:03:12.840> as<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.290> swing<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.980> bring<00:03:14.670> your<00:03:14.820> bird

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
pull as you swing and bring your bird

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.240 
pull as you swing and bring your bird
through<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.110> got<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.350> careful<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.920> you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
through so you got to be careful if you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.089 
through so you got to be careful if you
go<00:03:17.489> too<00:03:17.549> far<00:03:18.200> what<00:03:19.200> we're<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.010> go

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
go too far what we're in there if you go

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.520 
go too far what we're in there if you go
too<00:03:20.160> far<00:03:20.459> out<00:03:20.640> which<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.930> way<00:03:22.110> we<00:03:22.290> can't

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
too far out which this way we can't

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.960 
too far out which this way we can't
because<00:03:22.770> we're<00:03:22.920> inside<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
because we're inside the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.600 
because we're inside the
the<00:03:24.930> gravitational<00:03:25.620> field<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.550> go

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
the gravitational field but if you go

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.770 
the gravitational field but if you go
too<00:03:26.760> far<00:03:26.940> out<00:03:27.060> you're<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.270> fling<00:03:27.510> your<00:03:27.600> bird

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
too far out you're in fling your bird

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.510 
too far out you're in fling your bird
out<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.530> gonna<00:03:28.770> shoot<00:03:29.040> into<00:03:29.280> space

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
out and it's just gonna shoot into space

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.970 
out and it's just gonna shoot into space
and<00:03:29.670> not<00:03:29.820> go<00:03:29.970> anywhere<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.740> really

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
and not go anywhere so it's really

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.630 
and not go anywhere so it's really
interesting

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640
