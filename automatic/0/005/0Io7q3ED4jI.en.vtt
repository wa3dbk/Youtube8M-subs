00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 I wanted to buy simcity for the sake of one 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.740
 build goals when no 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.049
 just because of this having heard enough 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.120
 stories about diablo like running sensei 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 with falling servers inability to play 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.439
 without internet connection and i'm rubbing 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.910
 hands house his anger then but discontent 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.680
 hand electronics arts which is like 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 I love the publisher I appreciate and respect 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 but also the current policy of sucking 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.619
 I don’t share the money at all 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 ear accidentally caught the news about 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.460
 possible simcity micro transactions i 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.040
 then I decided that I would rub the electronics 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.630
 to the nines but somehow could not happened 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.640
 because I easily connected to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.469
 any game server even has a desktop for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
 than we dreamed so long can because 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 I did not see these transactions which 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 would climb my eyes from all over 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.879
 screen can be anyway 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 it turned out simcity pleasure is true 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.930
 it was never possible to build a grad 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 this is natural minus perhaps with minuses 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.199
 games and start to review at all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.120
 town planning simulator for me 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.879
 Occupations difficult in this genre I played 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
 only in network of simcity 4 and 1 targets to me 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 seemed complicated and for many 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 information settings and in the second I'm more 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 He loved not to build and destroy ready 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.479
 cities using volcanoes aliens and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 other 1 you in the new simcity in part 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.470
 the regime, the destruction of cities was not 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 because if he were the one about this 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 I was just hanging out when I started 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 building a city ​​in the eye immediately 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.610
 rushed the size of the territories they 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 tiny compared to the same 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 simcity 4 meaning build giant 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.610
 megalopolis will not work at all desire 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.799
 especially in the city necessarily needed 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.380
 industrial commercial and residential areas and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.939
 only you lack them all the time 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.619
 built up area for industrial 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.810
 factories as needed lived areas to 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.430
 lost more hard workers for hard workers 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.439
 need household products that give 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 commercial areas 1 1 1 and the whole 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.280
 the area is already covered with asphalt and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.470
 built up with the game does not see this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.360
 She will be with dampness you prove it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 need to build more industrial zones 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.170
 where and idiot idiot does not see the game and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.000
 obvious moves 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.590
 for example if your capital is gone 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.360
 the minuses are already upset 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.490
 the territory of the knowledge that exactly 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.409
 make a profit the game will still be 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.000
 display annoying information that they say 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.439
 you go bankrupt let's increase and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.540
 taxes disable utilities 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.940
 kill people and so in many aspects 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.100
 simcity games complain about you talking 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.230
 that everything is wrong although you have already fixed everything 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.180
 disappoint yet it is that specialization 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.160
 cities are very few cities can be 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.050
 industrial tourist or scientific 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.910
 center and will have to choose only one 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.890
 specialization because if you first 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.600
 went to the industry later on again 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.160
 same because of the small territories turn 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.050
 the city in mecca tourism will be extremely 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.150
 problematic and certainly not profitable 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.920
 maybe the developers wanted us not to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.900
 getting stuck on one city did 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.730
 many different and different from each other and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.860
 maybe this is a good idea but your 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.230
 super duper mega megapolis looks more like 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.880
 to a big village with skyscrapers but 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.650
 worth paying tribute to the city to build 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.090
 interesting primarily as either 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 strange because of the limited territory 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.650
 when you already have everything built up 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 you have to think fast 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.640
 where what to demolish where what to build to 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 make more profit a couple of times I caught 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.060
 yourself on the fact that gnawing nails nervous 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.860
 ennobling regions and the best 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.720
 utilities spending the whole budget and 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.430
 leaving in the minus is it worth to describe something 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.230
 happy states when with each 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.120
 Hours of money and residents is becoming 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.040
 more and you relaxed spread 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.510
 chair with a contented smile blissful 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.120
 watching how your 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.950
 the town grows more heaven to 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.200
 simcity can give emotions and 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.240
 quite strong and this is the main advantage of the game 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.740
 The graphics in the game is neat and semi 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.780
 cartoon and she told me very much 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.030
 Liked although some scolds again 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.310
 her for not realism destroy cities 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.960
 Now it does not work right away to cause 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.520
 earthquake or lizard will have 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.010
 carry out achievements to them here huge 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.200
 the amount of testing is given by the residents themselves 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.790
 build additional buildings 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.350
 catch some criminals clean 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.750
 all the trash for a certain period and so 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.140
 further it is a little slow down meditative 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.150
 gameplay 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.980
 another feature of the new simcity has become 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.690
 multiplayer is when you build a city 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.610
 any area and your friend or 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.860
 just another player builds next 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.760
 one with another player's city 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.170
 to interact 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.880
 send him goods to provide 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.530
 community help and so on but 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.540
 try multiplayer and I never 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.700
 it happened because wherever I went 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.470
 everywhere was either clogged or demanded 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.150
 some update and I got 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.190
 suspicion that this is the update 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.800
 costs 300 rubles called up to luxury 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.490
 deshin though i'm not really sure so 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.990
 do we have 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.550
 on the one hand not bad 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.230
 city ​​planning simulator with a cute 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.030
 graphics and simplistic but interesting 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.700
 gameplay able to give a bunch of new 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.960
 emotions from the other side of the new simcity not 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.060
 lets you feel all the romance 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.800
 giant megalopolises do not allow 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.330
 to develop the city as you planned 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.280
 gives you some scripts on 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.229
 which you must follow from what 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.940
 boob hail you if it happens not 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.009
 such as you conceived yes 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.530
 I wonder if you will be interested in playing 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.419
 when you build a city of every type in 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.159
 Overall, 7 and 7 points simcity 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.990
 deserved but personally I expected much 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.970
 more game from so wonderful 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 developer companies like maxis and on 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.740
 This all pee myself until people 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 at
