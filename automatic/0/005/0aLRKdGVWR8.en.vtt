00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:12.500
 today it is 600 while I say hello a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.900
 I still got latecomers 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.580
 then you know a particular evening 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 all 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.560
 an evening that we want to dedicate to everyone 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.260
 those who have always followed us but 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.250
 especially those who are here of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.189
 alongside us like mantia like simone 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 people who are not lucky like us 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.600
 we are very lucky because we are close 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.629
 certain people understand so many things 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.820
 I personally wanted to marry this 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.570
 cause and that I consider it valid but 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.250
 above all it makes me feel important 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 we will hear you selling because through 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 my work through succeeded that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.559
 we had during last summer 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.870
 especially in the province of rovigo 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.820
 that I have to thank because he has 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.470
 demonstrated a slice of comparisons in the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 our comparisons of the skin of mine 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.290
 in short, the historian's collaborators are 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 all that our movement 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:18.210
 I struggle to explain what 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 I try however I believe that people from the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.070
 great sensitivity as mattia like 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.900
 if you always want close to our ours 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 movement in our nightclub ours 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.780
 music 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.180
 I have heard the only words that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.100
 adore only music they found again 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 rediscovered the motivations of the coffin 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.450
 marika inter still believe something 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 important to believe that the differences 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.130
 they are not so abyssal but you were 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.170
 found in the morning is a person who has 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.479
 had the strength really had to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 energy and I have always tried to give 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.110
 then only music but above all also 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.890
 through emotions those that existed 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.619
 they make us live without emotion 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.270
 absolutely necessary to wake up 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 human because everything would be flat instead 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.970
 positive or negative emotions make us 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.190
 to live 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.750
 mattia knew how to win his 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.270
 battle and here tonight from 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.270
 protagonist it will be he does not know 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.420
 still but will be a guest of star people 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.160
 he knows this in this weapon 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.890
 I immediately tell her she had the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.530
 ability to perform in front of those 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.970
 which are colored 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.780
 curiosity is that you want to have fun 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.300
 we will have the chance these have 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.540
 so much to show everyone that you can 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.180
 go beyond the rule that bad luck 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.950
 well said this again thank you that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.330
 gave us the chance to be here 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.880
 in this magnificent square this evening 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.230
 the mayor of the other municipal list 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.120
 the haga association was that it was 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.410
 founded just in the morning and wants 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.670
 spread the serious problems that are there 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.370
 hidden in different realities from ours 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.440
 I leave you with the next great one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.230
 you would like poor preconception that there will be 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.350
 the morning exhibition as a state 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.330
 success last year thank you 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.519
 once again from the heart and I hope 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 have the sensitivity to make people feel 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.650
 Latin is an important person this 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.920
 evening and it will be even from today onwards 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.920
