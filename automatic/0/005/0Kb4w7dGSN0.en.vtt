fare<00:05:08.250> was<00:05:08.370> kind<00:05:08.550> of<00:05:08.580> an<00:05:08.699> acoustic<00:05:08.970> pit<00:05:09.419> stop<00:05:09.750> on

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
fare was kind of an acoustic pit stop on

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.170 
fare was kind of an acoustic pit stop on
the<00:05:10.470> LP<00:05:10.830> but<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.130> groove<00:05:11.370> on<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.759> track<00:05:11.970> is

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
the LP but the groove on the track is

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.140 
the LP but the groove on the track is
just<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.509> kind<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.840> rigid<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.150> underwhelming

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
just so kind of rigid and underwhelming

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.089 
just so kind of rigid and underwhelming
and<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.630> thought<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.020> pacing<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.710> track

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
and I thought the pacing on the track

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.249 
and I thought the pacing on the track
what<00:05:17.310> was<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:17.610> was<00:05:17.819> kind<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.259> underwhelming

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
what was that was kind of underwhelming

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.890 
what was that was kind of underwhelming

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
but what Lou does bring to this album is

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.499 
but what Lou does bring to this album is
is<00:05:36.780> definitely<00:05:37.020> some<00:05:37.530> much-needed<00:05:38.509> variety

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
is definitely some much-needed variety

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.230 
is definitely some much-needed variety
the<00:05:39.990> first<00:05:40.349> contribution<00:05:41.070> of<00:05:41.460> his<00:05:41.610> route<00:05:41.940> is

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
the first contribution of his route is

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.140 
the first contribution of his route is
is<00:05:42.810> kind<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.199> country<00:05:43.409> tinged<00:05:44.159> rocker<00:05:44.820> and

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
is kind of a country tinged rocker and

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.779 
is kind of a country tinged rocker and
later<00:05:45.690> recognition<00:05:46.650> on<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:47.340> album<00:05:47.639> really

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
later recognition on the album really

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.540 
later recognition on the album really
stands<00:05:48.150> out<00:05:48.300> because<00:05:48.449> of<00:05:48.630> its<00:05:48.780> staccato<00:05:49.650> riffs

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
stands out because of its staccato riffs

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.610 
stands out because of its staccato riffs
that<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.060> open<00:05:51.449> the<00:05:51.539> track<00:05:51.780> up<00:05:52.050> this<00:05:52.349> is<00:05:52.500> not

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
that that open the track up this is not

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.490 
that that open the track up this is not
a<00:05:52.680> bad<00:05:52.949> album<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.580> mean<00:05:53.729> great<00:05:54.180> closer<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.990> I

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
a bad album I mean great closer and I

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.409 
a bad album I mean great closer and I
think<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.949> first<00:05:56.159> two<00:05:56.430> songs<00:05:56.729> on<00:05:57.060> this<00:05:57.210> thing

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
think the first two songs on this thing

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.930 
think the first two songs on this thing
are<00:05:57.599> two<00:05:58.289> of<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.469> better<00:05:58.680> rock<00:05:59.069> songs<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.819> this

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
are two of the better rock songs of this

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.350 
are two of the better rock songs of this
year<00:06:00.240> period<00:06:01.020> but<00:06:01.349> overall<00:06:01.919> as<00:06:02.310> an<00:06:02.610> album<00:06:03.090> and

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
year period but overall as an album and

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.450 
year period but overall as an album and
just<00:06:03.630> as<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.020> band<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:04.770> don't<00:06:05.190> feel<00:06:05.340> like

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
just as a band I don't feel like

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.100 
just as a band I don't feel like
dinosaur<00:06:05.880> jr.<00:06:06.000> really<00:06:06.240> went<00:06:06.509> above<00:06:06.840> and

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
dinosaur jr. really went above and

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.800 
dinosaur jr. really went above and
beyond<00:06:07.560> in<00:06:07.919> any<00:06:08.460> way<00:06:08.789> you<00:06:09.509> know<00:06:09.630> it's

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
beyond in any way you know it's

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.260 
beyond in any way you know it's
comfortable<00:06:10.590> it's<00:06:10.770> consistent<00:06:11.610> which<00:06:12.060> is

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
comfortable it's consistent which is

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.570 
comfortable it's consistent which is
something<00:06:12.569> to<00:06:12.690> be<00:06:12.870> admired<00:06:13.500> for<00:06:13.740> sure<00:06:14.069> even

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
something to be admired for sure even

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.010 
something to be admired for sure even
though<00:06:14.729> there<00:06:14.880> were<00:06:15.000> several<00:06:15.300> tracks<00:06:15.630> on<00:06:15.900> this

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
though there were several tracks on this

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.540 
though there were several tracks on this
thing<00:06:16.199> that<00:06:16.229> I<00:06:16.409> did<00:06:16.620> find<00:06:16.919> to<00:06:17.069> be<00:06:17.159> slightly

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
thing that I did find to be slightly

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.790 
thing that I did find to be slightly
forgettable<00:06:18.509> I'm<00:06:18.780> feeling<00:06:19.110> strong<00:06:19.380> seven<00:06:19.710> to

forgettable I'm feeling strong seven to

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.409 
forgettable I'm feeling strong seven to
