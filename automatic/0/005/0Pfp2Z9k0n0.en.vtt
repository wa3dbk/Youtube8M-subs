00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
problem if you're doing this with this I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.010 
problem if you're doing this with this I
strong<00:01:01.860> have<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.150> very<00:01:03.360> careful<00:01:03.720> with<00:01:03.840> this

strong have to be very careful with this

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.650 
strong have to be very careful with this
state<00:01:04.440> then<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.700> string<00:01:05.970> them<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
state then I can string them up as a

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.890 
state then I can string them up as a
proxy<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> try<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> bend<00:01:09.660> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
proxy so you try not to bend this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.050 
proxy so you try not to bend this
because<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.710> he<00:01:10.800> said<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> rifle<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.760> honor

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
this that this is going to have a way to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.270 
this that this is going to have a way to
kind<00:01:14.910> have<00:01:15.150> run<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> only

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
kind have run on it you're not the only

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
kind have run on it you're not the only
amount<00:01:17.550> five<00:01:17.790> thousandth<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.479> inch<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
amount five thousandth of an inch and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.260 
amount five thousandth of an inch and
that's<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.070> any<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.670> than<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's it any more than that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.180 
that's it any more than that
the<00:01:21.899> thing<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.410> to<00:01:22.500> give<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> problems

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
the thing is going to give you problems

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.310 
the thing is going to give you problems
so<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> usually<00:01:24.690> have<00:01:24.990> two<00:01:25.170> by

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
so what I do is I usually have two by

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
so what I do is I usually have two by
fours<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.800> little<00:01:26.100> longer<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.119> supports

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
fours a little longer and that supports

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
fours a little longer and that supports
the<00:01:27.660> wheel<00:01:27.899> off<00:01:28.110> trail<00:01:29.930> that's<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.610> right

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the wheel off trail that's what right

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510 
the wheel off trail that's what right
now<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.690> is<00:01:34.410> one<00:01:34.800> thing<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.100> most<00:01:35.399> people

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
now this is one thing that most people

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
now this is one thing that most people
will<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.330> about<00:01:36.690> but<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.560> make

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will really think about but really make

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.190 
will really think about but really make
sense<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.700> tire<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.540> smaller<00:01:40.080> than<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> rim

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
sense the tire is smaller than the rim

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.900 
sense the tire is smaller than the rim
okay<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.560> makes<00:01:43.800> sense<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.369> because<00:01:44.550> we

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
okay that makes sense right because we

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.940 
okay that makes sense right because we
pay<00:01:45.090> their<00:01:45.270> fall<00:01:45.509> off<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.709> don't<00:01:46.770> want

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
pay their fall off and they don't want

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.199 
pay their fall off and they don't want
the<00:01:47.009> tire<00:01:47.220> fall-off<00:01:47.429> thread

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
the tire fall-off thread

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.150 
the tire fall-off thread
alright<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.020> said<00:01:49.229> how<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.679> heck<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
alright so they said how the heck you

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.969 
alright so they said how the heck you
get<00:01:50.520> higher<00:01:50.819> on<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.300> it's<00:01:51.450> smaller<00:01:51.979> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
get higher on if it's smaller it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.529 
get higher on if it's smaller it's
really<00:01:53.340> simple<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.910> you<00:01:54.000> look<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> rim

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
really simple if you look at the rim

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.680 
really simple if you look at the rim
it's<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.959> this<00:01:55.110> big<00:01:55.940> indentation<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.569> the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
it's got this big indentation in the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.139 
it's got this big indentation in the

backwards that's strictly up to you your

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.330 
backwards that's strictly up to you your
choice<00:03:09.390> look<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.530> tool<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.190> this

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
choice look at the tool you know this

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.120 
choice look at the tool you know this
has<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.520> bend<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.230> there<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.650> hasn't<00:03:13.800> been

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
has a bend in it there it hasn't been

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.130 
has a bend in it there it hasn't been
here<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:15.600> bend<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.470> hook<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.010> tire<00:03:17.280> bead

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
here the bend is to hook the tire bead

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.360 
here the bend is to hook the tire bead
so<00:03:19.140> if<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.320> put<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.920> guess

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
so if you put it in like this guess

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
off but you put it in this way it's

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.930
