00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
there's this little ring here this

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.949 
there's this little ring here this
little<00:03:01.640> plastic<00:03:02.000> ring<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.540> there's<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.840> little

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
little plastic ring and there's a little

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.130 
little plastic ring and there's a little
gap<00:03:03.380> right<00:03:03.440> here<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.510> that's

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
gap right here like this and that's

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.009 
gap right here like this and that's
going<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.760> match<00:03:07.760> up<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.600> little<00:03:08.870> arm

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
going to match up with this little arm

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.949 
going to match up with this little arm
right<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.430> go<00:03:10.700> ahead<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.000> position<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
right there so go ahead and position it

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.240 
right there so go ahead and position it
over<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:13.370> way<00:03:13.870> now<00:03:14.870> there's<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.650> little<00:03:15.950> pin

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
over that way now there's a little pin

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.140 
over that way now there's a little pin
for<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> indicator<00:03:18.070> down<00:03:19.070> here<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:22.150> this

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
for the indicator down here and this

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.060 
for the indicator down here and this
little<00:03:23.360> plastic<00:03:23.510> pin<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.709> want<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:24.980> to

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
little plastic pin and you want it to

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.180 
little plastic pin and you want it to
line<00:03:25.250> up<00:03:25.400> with<00:03:25.550> this<00:03:25.730> little<00:03:26.239> hole<00:03:26.600> right<00:03:26.989> here

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
line up with this little hole right here

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.130 
line up with this little hole right here
so<00:03:28.190> that's<00:03:28.310> about<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:28.940> trickiest<00:03:29.300> part<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.840> to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
so that's about the trickiest part is to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.540 
so that's about the trickiest part is to
get<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.320> lined<00:03:30.470> up<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:30.860> when<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.190> go<00:03:31.310> ahead<00:03:31.459> and

get it lined up so when you go ahead and
put<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.820> part<00:03:32.090> back<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.890> ahead<00:03:34.100> and

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
put this part back in just go ahead and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.780 
put this part back in just go ahead and
try<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:34.610> get<00:03:34.730> all<00:03:34.880> lined<00:03:35.420> up<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.640> set<00:03:37.640> this

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
try to get all lined up and set this

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.360 
try to get all lined up and set this
this<00:03:38.150> whole<00:03:38.390> part<00:03:38.780> back<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.530> you'll<00:03:40.190> feel

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
this whole part back in and you'll feel

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.190 
this whole part back in and you'll feel
it<00:03:40.580> kind<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.790> fall<00:03:41.030> down<00:03:41.239> into<00:03:41.450> place<00:03:41.780> when<00:03:42.140> you

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
get it there now to test it go ahead and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.740 
get it there now to test it go ahead and
you'll<00:03:47.360> shift<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.310> if<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:49.459> look<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:49.910> the

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
thing move shift it again and if it

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.740 
thing move shift it again and if it
moves<00:03:58.010> then<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.820> have<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.330> little<00:03:59.420> pin<00:03:59.720> in

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
moves then you have the little pin in

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.300
