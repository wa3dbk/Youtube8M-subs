00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.200
 hello very good to all and welcome a 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.090
 day more to my channel this time 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.490
 we inaugurate a new series on the channel 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.460
 a series that I 've never done is a 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.230
 Trade series or will consist of as you see 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.750
 in the title in the name of one's own 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.289
 series are called trade methods or where 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.500
 I will try to inform or explain a 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.910
 little different ways of working 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.739
 so you do not know what the trade is or what 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.830
 who is a little bit into the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.500
 ultimate I doubt I do not know what I'm going to 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.920
 explain also trade ar consists of 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.370
 buy a card either player 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 coach a consumable whatever in 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.290
 The concept of trade ar is to buy something 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.330
 sorry to sell something more expensive than what 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.129
 you have bought previously is not to say 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.729
 we buy a player for 100 coins and 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.530
 we sell it to 200 is a saying and in this 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.199
 occasion we go with the method I think that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.420
 the simplest you have to have a little 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.000
 of patience that yes is not that 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.930
 too many coins for example me now 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.770
 You see he was trying 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.830
 with a how to say it with a budget 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.470
 of 300 and a thousand thousand pesos and this trade 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.140
 or it would not give us the profit until 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.990
 do it repeated and repeated times but 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 for people who have just started or not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.300
 You will need to start having 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.950
 equipillo some 10,000 coins and the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.800
 truth yes he will notice it as I have 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.210
 said above is not something of 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.400
 instantaneous gain but you have to 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.340
 have patience but for me it is the most 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.220
 simple and is the least to break the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.430
 coconut to get some profit for 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.369
 little it will be to push 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.910
 gold players not brilliant starting 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.979
 of average 75 pushing 300 coins with 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.229
 much for it as we have seen the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.040
 beginning of the video we go to the market of 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.080
 transferable 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.810
 We are looking for gold and maximum bid of 250 for 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 that we are we who push the 300 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.360
 if we put 300 we will have to bid already 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 350 then we would not win in any 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.950
 benefit 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.400
 The objective of this trade or is to sell to 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.140
 the players to 400 450 coins 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.960
 depending on how good the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.000
 player that we have always bought 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 I usually buy something that is sold 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.810
 example I'm buying product that is 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.940
 the only gold porter of the police 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.700
 decent here a center forward 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.880
 Brazilian 80's rhythm a md of the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.490
 md league of 80 and pace peak since 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.800
 you see everything I've been buying what 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.900
 As you can see they are a bunch of players 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.090
 because you get them in a moment 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.190
 because always 300 gold players 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.390
 coins in the market you get them 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.600
 Quick 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.580
 and the truth works very fast 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.260
 to buy what the player is not then 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.260
 already to sell him to have a little 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 patience as you see this defense of 74 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.400
 of rhythm I put it and 400 coins of this 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.740
 this session I put them all to 400 except 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.610
 Here, I 'll take you two or three times 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.140
 300 if you expel 450 and as you will see or not 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.230
 I know if you see in the video but you made sure 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.770
 that ended up selling and now I'm going to 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.180
 put me to sell this I'm not going to put it 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.060
 in the video but I'm going to cut it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.220
 until everything is sold and a 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.930
 once sold some letters I'm going to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.940
 show so you can see that the method of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.640
 bear fruit not so now we see each other 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.640
 and good guys after putting a 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.180
 couple of times all the players like 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.060
 You see I sold a cuy tie here the md 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.130
 the kameni league a newcastle french 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.290
 more or less good players that 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.610
 often used in cheap equipment to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.970
 the people who do not have too much 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.640
 budget for better equipment like 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.830
 I've told you a lot of patience before 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.140
 I recommend buying all these 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.150
 players for this method at night 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 and leave the 12 hours all night that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.200
 they are selling here I have a 4 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.330
 more pages in the preselection is 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.240
 will end up selling very secure and in the 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.470
 case that I doubt it because with the 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.049
 I assure you that they are finished 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.080
 selling in the event that they are not sold 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.170
 just by discarding the 75th season media 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.360
 they give us 300 coins and if it's more than 76 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.540
 they give us more than 300 four coins like that 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.390
 that it is impossible for us to lose anything if 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
 we played in the 300 coins so 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.480
 now I am going to leave you a summary of what 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.310
 what to do in this trade or to 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.750
 that you have all the ideas clear and 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.129
 good as you see in the summary in 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.589
 screen the first step that we should 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:47.059
 is to look in the transferable market 

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:48.469
 gold players to 250 bid maximum for 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:52.279
 be us who push those 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:54.649
 three hundred never exceed 300 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.929
 coins to heretics that is sorry a 

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.759
 gold player not weird that you know that 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:00.349
 it's worth enough 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.869
 now I know not give an example for 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.669
 example if fernandinho del manchester 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:07.879
 city although this is not sure that 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.909
 they will bid more than 300 many more 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.999
 in general, never bid more than 300 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.129
 a player especially if it's average 75 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.529
 because it is treated or the truth is usually 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.869
 do with players between 75 average and 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.029
 76 and these players really are not worth 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:27.069
 too much and the last step is to sell to 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:29.449
 400 buy now or 450 depending on the player 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:32.509
 depending on how good it is and always 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.819
 put 50 less presidential coins 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:38.119
 that is, if we want to sell it to 400 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.979
 we put 350 initial 400 buy already for 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:43.309
 so that the buyer thinks that 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.319
 50 coins is not worth the long wait 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.449
 have exposed the auction and buy it 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.689
 directly 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.819
 the greatest possible benefit with the 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:56.770
 player not so I hope that I have 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:58.599
 liked this first chapter if you know a 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.389
 a trade method or if you do not have it 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.759
 all clear you tell me I'll look at it 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.400
 well as it is done I will try to do it in 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.189
 following episodes and nothing guys you 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.020
 I leave the last video in the description 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.599
 which is a pretty wilderness squad 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.779
 well the truth is that I say goodbye and even 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.779
 next
