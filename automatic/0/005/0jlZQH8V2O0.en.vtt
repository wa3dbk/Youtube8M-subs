 hello how about welcome to biker tv 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420
 in this chapter we have with us to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.050
 the German that everyone wants but not 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 think badly is the bmw s1000rr believe with 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.950
 us and find out if everything is true 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.950
 they say this is motor daughters baby 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.620
 in 2009 the first year of its production 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.000
 abm wwf revolutionizes the market of 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.920
 super sport ending the domain 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.920
 Japanese current of the last decade 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.460
 w really is a motorcycle that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 can enjoy at low speed even 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.450
 up to high speed 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.870
 the double erre was designed with the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.160
 superbike championship and in mind and it's 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.990
 the beginning of a strategy the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.280
 Bavarian house to place products in 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.870
 all market segments 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.990
 including the sporty the range that 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.330
 has on an acceleration scale 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.350
 even braking is very good is very 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.070
 well assisted is a bicycle that likes 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.440
 handle for any type of user 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 advanced intermediate beginner is a 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.930
 motorcycle that meets all 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.330
 assistance features to have 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.979
 very safe handling the double network has been 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.870
 made famous not only for its free 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.180
 performance but also because of its cost 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.000
 competitive compared to other exotic 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.650
 we have the advantage that we can 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 be completely opposite the settings to 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.550
 what do I mean you can do it 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.740
 completely sporty powerful briosa 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.480
 that makes little horses to have all that 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.700
 things are very funny but there are good 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.770
 to be careful and also with what 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.110
 brings brings traction control that makes 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.990
 that the back tire does not skid 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.610
 rai the old one and also you just want 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.610
 let the tire rise in front 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.989
 i 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.410
 wv put a lot of emphasis on the part 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.120
 technical a new and efficient 999 engine 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.650
 cubic centimeters 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080
 but in its visual aspect it forced a bit 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 its lines with an asymmetric design that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 many love and others today for 2012 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.390
 the chassis has been retouched to improve it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.950
 increasing the rigidity in the area 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.090
 front and adopting a position of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.310
 driving to the new configuration 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.930
 It has also retouched some dimensions of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
 the direction geometry but all the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.740
 retouching are very subtle the fat 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.190
 amazing what technology has 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.320
 advanced all these electronic aids 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.950
 thanks of these bikes the truth that they are 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.830
 very powerful and make them docile in 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.230
 some time already as you go 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.740
 getting experience in your management and in 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.510
 your experience with the motorcycle 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.460
 you can go removing those aids and make it 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.680
 a little more fun and more powerful 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.520
 but undoubtedly it is a person 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.100
 very good 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.700
 and what better science do you have and 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.700
 more secure 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.850
 the modifications to the suspension of the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.650
 double erre have been fundamental to 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.480
 boost your driving dynamics the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.340
 Front suspension is another changes to 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.230
 its internal structure providing a 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.690
 greater balance comfort and performance 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.459
 cushioning the magic of this motorbike 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.350
 is the ability to mutate in a 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.480
 authentic racing to a motorcycle for the no 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.450
 so experts with pressing a single button 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.850
 you have to move a little with people 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.670
 obviously specialized in what is the 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.120
 suspension geometry 23 dips and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.700
 any bike obviously lends itself 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.950
 for that you can can give much more and 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.950
 make it much safer is sometimes 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.560
 we have the fear of moving him and doing 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.050
 things when the agency comes out they advise 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.940
 with someone and bue is worth a little bit for 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.040
 that the bike feels a little better 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.020
 but the first thing we invite is 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.020
 tell him and if I can buy them 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.419
 It's an intuitive easy bike with an engine 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:44.789
 that meets and is left to handle without much 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.789
 effort its price is close to 17 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.409
 thousand dollars in this section we will be 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.389
 covering some of the basic tips 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.309
 to improve your technique in the 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.710
 motorcycling today's chapter 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.539
 we will be talking about brake brakes 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.460
 are one of the main causes of 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.810
 accidents learn to brake 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.760
 correctly is vital for your safety 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.650
 accelerates correctly is equal 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.270
 important that you brake correctly by 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.980
 your safety and for the long life of your 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.220
 machine must take into account these 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.220
 tips
