some<00:00:31.019> improvements<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> aerodynamics<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
some improvements to aerodynamics and I

you're doing 100 and you just kind of
duck<00:02:00.680> your<00:02:00.830> head<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.979> little<00:02:01.100> bit<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.490> don't

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
duck your head a little bit you don't

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.969 
duck your head a little bit you don't
even<00:02:01.759> feel<00:02:02.030> any<00:02:02.330> neck<00:02:02.570> pressure<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.799> just

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
even feel any neck pressure you just

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.359 
even feel any neck pressure you just
slice<00:02:04.190> right<00:02:04.310> through<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.670> air<00:02:06.190> this<00:02:07.190> is

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
slice right through the air this is

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.300 
slice right through the air this is
really<00:02:07.670> cool<00:02:08.770> they<00:02:09.770> have<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:11.390> lock

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
really cool they have this to lock

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.070 
really cool they have this to lock
