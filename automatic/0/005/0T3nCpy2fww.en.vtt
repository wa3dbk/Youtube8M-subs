00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello and welcome to the bag 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.799
 works we are burning and which and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.269
 Together we make cake pops for today 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 cake pops we room different ingredients 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599
 which are you can find below in the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 read the description 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 We are now catching the cake and in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.330
 joke on how the two things are done 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.289
 you can be in other videos of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.640
 look us up 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.650
 the links will be here now 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 fade in now for the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.710
 cake and jelly together 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 mix 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.070
 you can of course also the cake 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.179
 Do not have to buy ready now 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.279
 bake extra 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.590
 exactly the same with means 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.270
 one could also now a jam 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.590
 or so take then still piece 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 Maybe it will be there too 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.510
 kind of brief i start now 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 the cake as well as crumbs and that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.760
 Tailor piece by piece spoon for 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 to add spoon to it I take now 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 One-off gloves are you have to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.949
 Of course not but I like it 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110
 not so much if then the teaching 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.820
 comes under the fingernails should I 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.410
 like to wear disposable gloves 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000
 By the way, there is in every supermarket 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.080
 to buy 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.030
 I now take the cake my first time 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.030
 just a small piece and crumbled 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 I already have the little ones here 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.380
 groups and now I give the chillida 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.299
 too unfortunately one can not say so 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 A lot of sick cake comes so much 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.830
 snow because it depends on the cake 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 baked very dry teilhaftig 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.509
 depending on how dry it must be 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.000
 accordingly , he wants more 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.220
 That's why we have to do that a bit now 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 I'm starting now with little 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:43.170
 snow and are gradually becoming more 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 Snow always give good kneading 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.899
 and be patient because it will be with you 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.670
 the time is always getting darker and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.079
 mixes better and better must be right 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.320
 nice too and starts now 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.010
 direction so far together again 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.050
 connect 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.190
 By the way , you can pay attention to that 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.930
 chiaroscuro and color quite like so 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.840
 especially if you had a helmet cake 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.750
 one more jam happens that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.300
 of which then becomes so happy what 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.810
 That's why it does not always look so nice 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.900
 best light jeans for example 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:32.510
 for that one even solidified 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.350
 not only seek lie down precisely 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.130
 said and that looks pretty good 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:43.550
 It can drive and can now 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.030
 balls came so wanted to roll 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.900
 me now male reinforcement though 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.840
 would, so to speak, do with me today 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.670
 or to small balls roll 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.150
 Lambertz from hang it ends naturally 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.290
 turn off an ideal size are 25 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.840
 up to 30 grams 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.220
 but we do it now just 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.220
 by eye and roll now 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.220
 successively 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.940
 the watching balls are now rolled and 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.570
 the next step is to pass 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.740
 now wants 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.540
 I already have chocolate for that 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.250
 tempered that I show in one 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.420
 another video just click on the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.660
 link so we have our lolli here 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.260
 styles you get in the meantime 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.530
 many online shops and us 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.060
 start now the stems first in the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.600
 to dip the letter 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.540
 to put them in the ball then 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.090
 we do it with the overture 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.800
 the ball better lolly considers it as 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.460
 As you can see, such a small one emerges 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.800
 drip and later helps with it 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.980
 that the ball does not lolly down 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.290
 just fall into the chocolate 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.390
 dive in and kick in the kicker 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.840
 You have to pay attention that he does not have to 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.120
 deep inside because then the danger 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.049
 is that he comes out up here again 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.110
 from us then at the magazine 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.370
 the style comes out of the top again that will 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.110
 now for a while rest 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.360
 or the chocolate must 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.980
 so that this drop of the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.630
 that's where that really happened 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.580
 whole holds if you the whole 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.110
 of course, too 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.450
 in the fridge so set for ten 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.030
 about minutes but aware of it 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.910
 make us out again takes the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.900
 not immediately overdrawn because of the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.710
 balls should not be too cold 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.750
 magazine 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.820
 in emails the cake pops and plate 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.560
 For a long time you 've been a good stylist 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.880
 Just take the chocolate pure 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.530
 shake off a bit and shake off 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.260
 then decorate to your heart's content 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.550
 that's what the world will take over, just like us 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.500
 have already prepared something here 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.760
 is a savior more easy with yourself 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.180
 the drill a few holes in 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.280
 made 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.950
 Of course you can not styrofoam either 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.810
 in the hardware store 43 euro or so but we 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.320
 take it quite happy and brad is 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.610
 simply fancier 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.110
 we have deco here once 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.849
 That's natural, of course 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.590
 almond nut cake we yes here 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.490
 of course, have been suitable 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.020
 otherwise you can of course with 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.419
 Working nico they are here 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.340
 little golden sugar couple the 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.050
 of course with milk chocolate on 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.969
 wonderful to just take the head 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.909
 that he is completely of chocolate 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.560
 is shrouded and then careful 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.349
 do not pull off too much and shake off 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.849
 also under feel and so laterally 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:46.199
 subtract that is very important otherwise 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.099
 the ball ends up in the so still one 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.620
 a little too much 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:53.009
 but now starts with less reason 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.490
 to then drop again courageously hierum 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:00.719
 turn around and shake on the others 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.840
 I hand over to the decorators 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.840
 continue 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.830
 very chic 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.020
 we liked that you liked it 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.050
 the other videos subscribe to the channel 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.460
 and comments commented that to you 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.770
 liked if it worked 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.450
 maybe, maybe not 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.970
 yes, we will be happy as soon as we feed 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.180
 now hardy cake pops thicker 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.180
 become
