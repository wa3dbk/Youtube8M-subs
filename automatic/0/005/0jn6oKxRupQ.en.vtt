00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.960 

on<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.560> model<00:00:02.010> we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.520> remove

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
on this model we're going to remove

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.269 
on this model we're going to remove
parts<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.750> brain<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.380> separate<00:00:05.069> other

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
parts of the brain and separate other

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.370 
parts of the brain and separate other
parts<00:00:05.730> so<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.810> can<00:00:06.960> better<00:00:07.140> locate<00:00:08.120> the

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
parts so that we can better locate the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.509 
parts so that we can better locate the
position<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.980> ventricles<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:13.340> this<00:00:14.340> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
position of the ventricles so this is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.670 
position of the ventricles so this is
the<00:00:14.639> anterior<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> brain<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.379> going

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the anterior of the brain and I'm going

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.480 
the anterior of the brain and I'm going
to<00:00:16.740> remove<00:00:17.250> part<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> frontal<00:00:18.660> lobe<00:00:20.689> and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
to remove part of the frontal lobe and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.179 
to remove part of the frontal lobe and
we<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.869> anterior<00:00:25.529> part<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we can see the anterior part of the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.330 
we can see the anterior part of the
lateral<00:00:26.730> ventricles<00:00:29.779> I'm<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.340> remove

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
lateral ventricles I'm going to remove

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.569 
lateral ventricles I'm going to remove
some<00:00:32.399> more<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> brain<00:00:34.040> okay<00:00:35.040> here's<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
some more of the brain okay here's the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.130 
some more of the brain okay here's the
corpus<00:00:35.969> callosum<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.550> here<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.420> rest<00:00:39.840> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
corpus callosum and here is the rest of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.790 
corpus callosum and here is the rest of
the<00:00:40.379> lateral<00:00:40.800> ventricle<00:00:40.829> here's<00:00:41.700> its<00:00:41.910> tail

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
the lateral ventricle here's its tail

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
the lateral ventricle here's its tail
coming<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:43.980> its<00:00:44.280> space<00:00:46.550> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> insula

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
coming into its space this is the insula

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
coming into its space this is the insula
that's<00:00:49.350> laying<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.980> top<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> thalamus<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that's laying on top of the thalamus so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
that's laying on top of the thalamus so
lateral<00:00:54.480> ventricle<00:00:55.050> lateral<00:00:55.800> ventricle<00:00:57.739> they

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
lateral ventricle lateral ventricle they

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.330 
lateral ventricle lateral ventricle they
flow<00:00:59.430> into<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.420> third<00:01:00.719> ventricle<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.590> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
flow into the third ventricle this one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.460 
flow into the third ventricle this one
is<00:01:02.550> difficult<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:04.100> really<00:01:05.100> picture<00:01:06.470> without

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
is difficult to really picture without

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460 
is difficult to really picture without
looking<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> model<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.439> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
looking at a model like this but it is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.730 
looking at a model like this but it is
located<00:01:11.720> between<00:01:12.720> my<00:01:13.200> thumbs<00:01:14.299> right<00:01:15.740> there

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
located between my thumbs right there

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.020 
located between my thumbs right there
then<00:01:20.299> remember<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.810> fluid<00:01:22.170> flows<00:01:22.530> through

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
then remember the fluid flows through

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.530 
then remember the fluid flows through
the<00:01:24.030> cerebral<00:01:24.659> aqueduct<00:01:26.030> into<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> fourth

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the cerebral aqueduct into the fourth

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
the cerebral aqueduct into the fourth
ventricle<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.860> difficult<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
ventricle and in this is difficult to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
ventricle and in this is difficult to
envision<00:01:33.650> unless<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> another<00:01:35.280> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
envision unless you have another like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.800 
envision unless you have another like
this<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.040> cerebral<00:01:38.549> aqueduct<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.540> about

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this so the cerebral aqueduct is about

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:49.039 
this so the cerebral aqueduct is about
the<00:01:39.990> level<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.560> thumb<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:42.710> right<00:01:44.780> here

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.109 

at<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.200> bottom<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.970> where<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.950> little

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
at the bottom right where the little

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
at the bottom right where the little
divider<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.619> fourth<00:01:56.950> ventricle

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.420 

so<00:02:05.460> from<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.970> lateral<00:02:06.330> ventricles<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
so from the lateral ventricles to the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.560 
so from the lateral ventricles to the
third<00:02:09.920> through<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.070> aqueduct<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:15.180> fourth

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
third through the aqueduct to the fourth

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.710 
third through the aqueduct to the fourth
ventricle<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> court<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
ventricle and then on to the court the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.690 
ventricle and then on to the court the
flow<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.620> from<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.850> lateral<00:02:24.300> ventricles

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
flow then is from the lateral ventricles

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.420 
flow then is from the lateral ventricles
into<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.540> third<00:02:27.960> ventricle<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:31.650> through

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
into the third ventricle then through

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.920 
into the third ventricle then through
the<00:02:32.640> aqueduct<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:37.850> finally<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.600> fourth

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the aqueduct and finally to the fourth

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.220 
the aqueduct and finally to the fourth
ventricle<00:02:40.580> from<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.790> fourth<00:02:42.090> ventricle<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
ventricle from the fourth ventricle the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.070 
ventricle from the fourth ventricle the
fluid<00:02:43.740> finds<00:02:44.670> its<00:02:44.820> way<00:02:44.910> into<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.660> central

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
fluid finds its way into the central

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.730 
fluid finds its way into the central
canal<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.830> cord<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.500> fourth

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
canal of the cord in the fourth

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.310 
canal of the cord in the fourth
ventricle<00:02:50.090> some<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.330> fluid<00:02:51.750> escapes

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
ventricle some of the fluid escapes

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
ventricle some of the fluid escapes
through<00:02:52.770> three<00:02:53.070> openings<00:02:53.840> into<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
through three openings into the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.510 
through three openings into the
subarachnoid<00:02:55.350> space<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.870> brain<00:02:58.520> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
remainder travels through the cord and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
remainder travels through the cord and
leaves<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:05.100> central<00:03:05.550> canal<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.030> cord
