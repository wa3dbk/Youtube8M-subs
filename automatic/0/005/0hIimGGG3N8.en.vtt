to get that mask and you can see the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740 
to get that mask and you can see the
little<00:01:13.980> bit<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> mask<00:01:14.550> over<00:01:14.940> here<00:01:15.210> showing<00:01:15.600> you

little bit of mask over here showing you
it's<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.520> right<00:01:17.520> click<00:01:18.230> over<00:01:19.230> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> image

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
it's there right click over on the image

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.300 
it's there right click over on the image
here<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> painting<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:21.800> they<00:01:22.800> call<00:01:23.100> their

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
here on the painting and they call their

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.670 
here on the painting and they call their
mass<00:01:23.550> alpha<00:01:24.240> maps<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
mass alpha maps right now I think that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.410 
mass alpha maps right now I think that
will<00:01:25.800> change<00:01:25.860> later<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:26.909> now<00:01:27.240> it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
will change later on but right now it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.899 
will change later on but right now it's
called<00:01:27.659> alpha<00:01:28.110> map<00:01:28.320> click<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.370> that<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
called alpha map click on that and you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.149 
called alpha map click on that and you
can<00:01:30.120> see<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> previous<00:01:31.170> alpha<00:01:31.710> matte

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
can see this is the previous alpha matte

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
do another one I'm going to go over here

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.710 
do another one I'm going to go over here
I<00:04:12.600> think<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:13.020> one<00:04:13.260> was<00:04:13.380> random<00:04:13.920> painter<00:04:14.400> and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
I think this one was random painter and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.260 
I think this one was random painter and
let's<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.989> show<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
let's just show you this one in the

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.870 
let's just show you this one in the
random<00:04:18.720> painter<00:04:19.169> there<00:04:19.380> was<00:04:19.620> no<00:04:19.919> masks<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.730> if

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
random painter there was no masks so if

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.940 
random painter there was no masks so if
I<00:04:20.970> wanted<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.359> right<00:04:21.450> click<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.169> could<00:04:22.410> do<00:04:22.560> edit

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
I wanted to right click I could do edit

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.370 
I wanted to right click I could do edit
alpha<00:04:23.340> matte<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.820> again<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.720> could<00:04:25.020> go<00:04:25.169> ahead

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
alpha matte and again I could go ahead

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.590 
alpha matte and again I could go ahead
and<00:04:25.500> create<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.010> mask<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.640> keep<00:04:26.970> all<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.240> that

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
and create the mask and keep all of that

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.279 
and create the mask and keep all of that
so<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:29.100> really<00:04:29.660> unbelievable<00:04:30.660> way<00:04:30.870> to

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
so this is a really unbelievable way to

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.000 
so this is a really unbelievable way to
do<00:04:31.500> fast<00:04:32.370> portraits<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.300> fast<00:04:34.200> portrait

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
do fast portraits and fast portrait

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.740 
do fast portraits and fast portrait
