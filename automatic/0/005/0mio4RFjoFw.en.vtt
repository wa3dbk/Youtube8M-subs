shoulder blade and visit how this is how
it<00:00:39.180> works<00:00:45.110> okay<00:00:46.110> first<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.489> Theory

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
it works okay first a little Theory

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
it works okay first a little Theory
theoretical<00:00:48.899> input<00:00:49.370> because<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
theoretical input because in the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
theoretical input because in the
exercise<00:00:51.300> later<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:51.870> hide<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> ball<00:00:52.620> but

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
exercise later I will hide the ball but

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.610 
exercise later I will hide the ball but
now<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> want<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> show<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.230> do

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
balls the large one or the medium one

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490 
balls the large one or the medium one
and<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.040> place<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.210> outside<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.020> your

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and you place it on the outside of your

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.550 
and you place it on the outside of your
shoulder<00:01:13.770> plate<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> bone<00:01:15.560> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
shoulder plate so not on the bone just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.910 
shoulder plate so not on the bone just
on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> muscles<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.869> right<00:01:18.869> beneath<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
on the muscles on right beneath the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.330 
on the muscles on right beneath the
shoulder<00:01:20.610> blade<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.049> get<00:01:22.350> pressure

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
shoulder blade and then you get pressure

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.630 
shoulder blade and then you get pressure
on<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:25.009> come<00:01:26.009> around<00:01:27.080> full<00:01:28.080> circle

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
on it and you come around full circle

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.130 
on it and you come around full circle
around<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.970> shoulder<00:01:30.360> plate<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:33.140> if

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
around your shoulder plate like this if

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
around your shoulder plate like this if
you<00:01:34.350> take<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> medium<00:01:35.100> ball<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> little

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you take the medium ball it's a little

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
you take the medium ball it's a little
bit<00:01:36.270> easier<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.320> pressure<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
bit easier to get more pressure on a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
bit easier to get more pressure on a
special<00:01:38.579> point<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:42.200> yeah

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
special point if you do that and yeah

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.920 
special point if you do that and yeah
you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> point<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.869> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you can if you have a point where it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.639 
you can if you have a point where it
really<00:01:46.079> hurts<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:47.100> stay<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.880> point<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
really hurts then stay on that point and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.120 
really hurts then stay on that point and
stand<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> pain<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.659> move<00:01:52.259> your<00:01:52.680> arm

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
stand the pain and if you move your arm

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.850 
stand the pain and if you move your arm
a<00:01:53.369> little<00:01:53.399> bit<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.689> move<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.049> upwards

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
a little bit if you move it upwards

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.330 
a little bit if you move it upwards
also<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.880> rotate<00:01:57.840> your<00:01:58.049> shoulder<00:01:58.469> blade<00:01:58.680> so

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
also you rotate your shoulder blade so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.050 
also you rotate your shoulder blade so
you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.979> special<00:02:02.490> positions

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you can in can get in special positions

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.139 
you can in can get in special positions
and<00:02:03.329> maybe<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.159> point<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.850> really

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and maybe there is the point that really

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.690 
and maybe there is the point that really
hurts<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.350> stay<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> get

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
hurts and then stay on that one to get

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.219 
hurts and then stay on that one to get
the<00:02:08.849> muscle

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
the muscle

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.390 
the muscle
lose<00:02:09.409> if<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.069> put<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.459> up<00:02:10.870> arm<00:02:11.870> right<00:02:12.709> behind

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
lose if you put the up arm right behind

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.990 
lose if you put the up arm right behind
your<00:02:13.610> back

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
your back

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.910 
your back
your<00:02:14.299> shoulder<00:02:14.720> blade<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:14.989> lifting<00:02:15.739> up<00:02:15.890> a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
your shoulder blade is lifting up a
