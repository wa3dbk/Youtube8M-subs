 Hello and welcome to one

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.070
 how to provide 16/1 namely 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 Of course, first the latest 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.369
 rational better under the link there is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.439
 in the video description then we go 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.580
 at redstone on extras then on select 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 ips of the bio 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.340
 and then we have the version 6.0 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.640
 choose 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.370
 So here's on ios point com 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 Link can also be found in the description 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:49.620
 and download the version 6.0 for yours 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.149
 shut down so I show that here 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.050
 with an ipod touch the fourth 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.300
 generation 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.329
 and the way I show it works 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 that too with an iphone 4 and one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:07.260
 iphone 3gs with iphone 4s and five unfortunately 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.880
 not so we load down 160 and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 then we take this out then 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.400
 we'll open it then says 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:25.049
 monstrance mode that was recognized 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:31.619
 Okay, then get away and be prepared 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.540
 but the jmk the ipod not yet for it 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.570
 we have to do the sport first 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:44.729
 turn off so now the off 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.579
 operational when we asked in the studio 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.350
 And in that another person wants that table 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.470
 Just let both select and then 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.299
 click on next so now we will 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 asked to bring the ipod in lemgo there 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.600
 me people that from the net to the video always 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.899
 asked again 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.229
 you can also click on next and 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.170
 Here you get the instructions again 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.950
 So, ten seconds have to be both buttons 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.190
 to press 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 after ten seconds the power button 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.519
 let go and continue 15 seconds 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:28.200
 press home button 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:37.620
 Well, then I'll do it 1 2 3 4 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:39.870
 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then the homebutton 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.260
 let go and hit the power button at fendt 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.500
 been 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.110
 So already is in the timer and again 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.090
 everything explains for example but 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.459
 we can start working 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.060
 let go of homebutton too and now will 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.560
 the jailbreak on the ipod loaded the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.560
 ipod is jailbreaking stands 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.239
 downloading date if you have the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:14.549
 can not read and here we see 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:15.870
 again the metrics mode so prettner 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.549
 we will be reminded again 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:25.590
 that this is a trick and we have the ipod 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.780
 good and must, though 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.780
 each of times when you complete the ipod 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.970
 makes you have to connect to the pc 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.970
 and book with 13 hotels 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.430
 I can do that as soon as the iPod is finished 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.880
 is printed that lasts here 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.630
 That's why we skip it that way 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.530
 After the jailbreak process is done 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.200
 an apple appears and the ipod comes 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.480
 back to 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.480
 So I just enter the code 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.639
 ok, but we do not see any here 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.419
 aim 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:18.350
 that's because we have the ipod first 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:21.940
 by necessity 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.700
 and then for we also redsnow 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.510
 click Beck then we have to go again 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.800
 press select ips convertible and then 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:39.100
 select again 6.0 important that we 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.650
 6.0 and not 6.01 and 06.01 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.550
 We are wrong about the action 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.780
 6.0 fade open then it stands 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:55.520
 became successful in the deep and then 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.970
 on the boat and again we bring 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:04.540
 our ipod in fashion so we keep 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.540
 ten seconds both buttons pressed and 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:24.260
 and then ten seconds only 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:36.580
 homebutton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:36.580
 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.120
 so at red nose he puts the files 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:50.990
 already on the ipod and was in the test 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:58.210
 and we see the pineapple on the ipod like that 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:03.230
 with redsnow are done and on ipod too 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:06.140
 once you have now completed booting is 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:10.420
 the boil and has bled and that 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.420
 means we can study used 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:22.130
 that takes a short moment to very good 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:30.050
 I already gave it the code 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:40.010
 one of the codes entered and we 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:41.780
 See how borussia is here for you 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.750
 we are asked who we are 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:51.860
 We already know that from online video 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:53.050
 Just dial in user so that's it 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.330
 already 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.330
 then bye and see you next time
