00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the black liquid liner here I tend to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
the black liquid liner here I tend to
stay<00:01:10.350> away<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:10.680> pot<00:01:11.159> liquid<00:01:11.520> liners<00:01:11.820> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
stay away from pot liquid liners like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
stay away from pot liquid liners like
this<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> feel<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.500> deposits<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
this because I feel like it deposits a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
this because I feel like it deposits a
little<00:01:14.580> bit<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.270> product<00:01:15.990> onto<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
little bit too much product onto the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
little bit too much product onto the
eyelid<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.220> hard<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> control<00:01:17.939> what

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
eyelid and it's hard to control what

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.789 
eyelid and it's hard to control what
you're<00:01:18.570> putting<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.590> something

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you're putting on there was something

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
you're putting on there was something
about<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.369> liked<00:01:20.640> first<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> all

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
about this that I liked first of all

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it's kind of like a little felt kind of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.929 
it's kind of like a little felt kind of
tip<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.530> fine<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:25.979> almost<00:01:26.640> mimics

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
tip but it's so fine that almost mimics

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.359 
tip but it's so fine that almost mimics
a<00:01:27.030> brush<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> look<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.380> black<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
a brush and look at how black and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.990 
a brush and look at how black and
pigmented<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.320> crazy

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
pigmented that is that is like crazy

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.719

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
formula even though it is liquid it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.030 
formula even though it is liquid it
dries<00:01:38.579> too<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.360> almost<00:01:40.079> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> matte

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
then you try to cover up the eyeliner

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.900 
then you try to cover up the eyeliner
with<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.350> mascara<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.280> sometimes<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.670> doesn't
