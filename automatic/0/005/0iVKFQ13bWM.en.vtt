hard to place because there's only

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
most consistently but for fifth place we

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.000 
most consistently but for fifth place we
put<00:00:37.129> on<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.670> variety<00:00:38.210> of<00:00:38.420> X<00:00:38.720> like<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:39.380> put<00:00:39.649> middle

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
we kind of saved themselves in the way

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.300 
we kind of saved themselves in the way
of<00:01:45.850> how<00:01:46.570> they<00:01:46.780> were<00:01:46.899> like<00:01:47.140> tier<00:01:47.770> 1<00:01:47.979> for<00:01:48.280> a

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
of how they were like tier 1 for a

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.830 
of how they were like tier 1 for a
couple<00:01:48.640> months<00:01:48.759> at<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.119> start<00:01:49.329> of<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.420> format

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
couple months at the start of the format

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.350 
couple months at the start of the format
and<00:01:50.049> then<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:51.100> they're<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.729> I'm<00:01:51.939> kind

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
and then now they're just like I'm kind

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.109 
and then now they're just like I'm kind
of<00:01:52.390> like<00:01:52.539> under<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.439> radar<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.069> now<00:01:54.909> they

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
of like under the radar and now they

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.020 
of like under the radar and now they
probably<00:01:55.329> won't<00:01:55.509> get<00:01:55.780> hit<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.380> ballast

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
probably won't get hit on the ballast

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.319 
probably won't get hit on the ballast
people<00:01:58.110> morels<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.530> really<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.399> literally<00:02:01.119> got

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
people morels I really you literally got

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.550 
people morels I really you literally got
everything<00:02:02.700> okay<00:02:03.700> I'm<00:02:03.939> number<00:02:04.299> three<00:02:04.329> I<00:02:04.780> have

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
everything okay I'm number three I have

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.109 
everything okay I'm number three I have
and<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.340> have<00:02:06.610> evil<00:02:07.090> swarms<00:02:07.470> um<00:02:08.470> they<00:02:09.160> probably

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
and we have evil swarms um they probably

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.030 
and we have evil swarms um they probably
get<00:02:10.539> like<00:02:10.569> one<00:02:10.959> or<00:02:11.110> two<00:02:11.170> spots<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.830> every

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
get like one or two spots and every

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.449 
get like one or two spots and every
single<00:02:12.360> national<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.870> far<00:02:14.400> sometimes<00:02:15.400> they

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
single national so far sometimes they

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.069 
single national so far sometimes they
don't<00:02:15.579> top<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:16.090> most<00:02:16.329> of<00:02:16.480> times<00:02:16.660> they<00:02:16.900> will

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
don't top but most of times they will

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.530 
don't top but most of times they will
and<00:02:17.650> we'll<00:02:18.160> probably<00:02:18.459> see<00:02:18.670> like<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.299> in<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and we'll probably see like one in the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.289 
and we'll probably see like one in the
top<00:02:19.720> eight<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> couple<00:02:21.069> top<00:02:21.400> six<00:02:21.670> teens<00:02:21.940> and

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
top eight and a couple top six teens and

keeps on going down like the only main

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.410 
keeps on going down like the only main
part<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.170> Cross<00:03:08.769> I'll<00:03:09.000> certain<00:03:10.000> sir<00:03:10.180> see

fifteen to twenty dollars and also in
other<00:03:15.250> things<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:15.639> think<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:15.970> even<00:03:16.090> phones

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
other things I think that even phones

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.210 
other things I think that even phones
are<00:03:16.569> one<00:03:16.660> like<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.930> most<00:03:17.109> is<00:03:17.290> kind<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.069> its

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
are one like the most is kind of its

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.580 
are one like the most is kind of its
meta<00:03:18.519> but<00:03:19.299> it's<00:03:19.420> also<00:03:19.540> kind<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.870> anti<00:03:20.139> meta<00:03:20.349> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
meta but it's also kind of anti meta to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.540 
meta but it's also kind of anti meta to
the<00:03:20.769> first<00:03:20.980> second<00:03:21.459> even<00:03:22.269> title<00:03:22.780> normal

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
the first second even title normal

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.510 
the first second even title normal
like<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.390> it's<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.860> way<00:03:26.010> where<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.490> can

majority will be spell books and dragon

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.720 
majority will be spell books and dragon
rulers<00:03:48.420> um<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.380> put<00:03:49.680> spell<00:03:50.130> books<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.520> number

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
rulers um we put spell books a number

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.800 
rulers um we put spell books a number
two<00:03:50.970> um<00:03:53.690> dragon<00:03:54.690> rulers<00:03:54.960> win<00:03:55.290> or<00:03:56.070> tap<00:03:56.610> more<00:03:56.970> but

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
two um dragon rulers win or tap more but

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.560 
two um dragon rulers win or tap more but
uh<00:03:58.080> if<00:03:58.740> we<00:03:58.980> look<00:03:59.190> at<00:03:59.340> what<00:04:00.210> will<00:04:00.360> win

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
uh if we look at what will win

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.870 
uh if we look at what will win
specifically<00:04:01.350> i<00:04:01.380> would<00:04:01.770> bet<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.340> spell

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
specifically i would bet that spell

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.630 
specifically i would bet that spell
books<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:04.080> more<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> chance<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:05.040> win<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.610> I

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
books have more of a chance to win but I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.030 
books have more of a chance to win but I
think<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.600> more<00:04:06.750> popular<00:04:07.320> deck<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.860> more

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
think the more popular deck and more

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.170 
think the more popular deck and more
taps<00:04:08.430> would<00:04:08.790> be<00:04:10.340> dragon<00:04:11.340> roars<00:04:11.550> like<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.000> have

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
taps would be dragon roars like you have

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.660 
taps would be dragon roars like you have
a<00:04:12.210> very<00:04:12.690> good<00:04:12.900> matchup<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.740> I<00:04:13.980> think<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
a very good matchup with I think the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.610 
a very good matchup with I think the
matchups<00:04:15.450> more<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.780> your<00:04:15.930> favorite<00:04:16.380> spell

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
matchups more in your favorite spell

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.590 
matchups more in your favorite spell
books<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:17.519> because<00:04:17.760> now<00:04:17.910> they<00:04:18.120> mean<00:04:18.299> kick

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
books just because now they mean kick

to<00:05:08.390> lose<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.590> think<00:05:10.550> if<00:05:10.640> people<00:05:10.670> side<00:05:11.240> well

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
to lose to I think if people side well

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.180 
to lose to I think if people side well
they<00:05:13.280> will<00:05:14.020> but<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.290> think<00:05:15.650> people<00:05:15.800> will<00:05:15.950> side

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190

they will but I think people will side
the<00:05:16.310> most<00:05:16.490> for<00:05:16.790> dragon<00:05:17.540> rulers<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.100> they

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
the most for dragon rulers and they

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.060 
the most for dragon rulers and they
might<00:05:19.340> not<00:05:19.520> top<00:05:19.850> as<00:05:20.120> much<00:05:20.480> and<00:05:20.750> maybe<00:05:21.500> spokes

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
might not top as much and maybe spokes

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.970 
might not top as much and maybe spokes
without<00:05:22.370> more<00:05:22.580> but<00:05:23.300> um<00:05:23.600> yeah<00:05:24.410> there<00:05:24.590> i<00:05:24.620> think
