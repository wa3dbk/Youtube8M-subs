getting my things myself here we have
the<00:05:29.419> sharpie<00:05:30.419> wide<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:33.140> here<00:05:34.140> is<00:05:34.320> the

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
the sharpie wide and here is the

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.270 
the sharpie wide and here is the
calligraphy<00:05:35.100> pen<00:05:36.410> so<00:05:37.410> as<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.800> can<00:05:37.919> see<00:05:37.979> these

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
calligraphy pen so as you can see these

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.890 
calligraphy pen so as you can see these
are<00:05:38.430> both<00:05:38.550> good<00:05:38.790> for<00:05:38.970> different<00:05:39.270> purposes<00:05:39.780> um

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
are both good for different purposes um

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.670 
are both good for different purposes um
so<00:05:42.900> we'll<00:05:43.200> go<00:05:43.320> up<00:05:43.350> close<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:45.169> sharpie<00:05:46.169> you

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
so we'll go up close to the sharpie you

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.800 
so we'll go up close to the sharpie you
can<00:05:46.860> see<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.340> gives<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.640> pretty<00:05:47.850> even<00:05:48.210> line<00:05:48.419> no

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
can see it gives a pretty even line no

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.659 
can see it gives a pretty even line no
streaks<00:05:49.229> that<00:05:49.650> much<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:52.350> cap<00:05:52.590> is<00:05:52.979> not<00:05:53.370> very

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
streaks that much the cap is not very

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.000 
streaks that much the cap is not very
accurate<00:05:53.850> it<00:05:54.840> kind<00:05:55.289> of<00:05:55.350> looks<00:05:55.500> accurate<00:05:55.950> in

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
accurate it kind of looks accurate in

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.159 
accurate it kind of looks accurate in
the<00:05:56.100> camera<00:05:56.460> but<00:05:56.669> in<00:05:57.390> real<00:05:57.570> life<00:05:57.630> this<00:05:57.990> is<00:05:58.140> a

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
the camera but in real life this is a

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.380 
the camera but in real life this is a
bit<00:05:58.800> more<00:05:58.950> greeny<00:05:59.340> this<00:05:59.910> town<00:06:00.240> here<00:06:01.669> and<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:03.240> M

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
bit more greeny this town here and the M

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.779 
bit more greeny this town here and the M
went<00:06:03.750> pretty<00:06:03.900> good<00:06:04.169> except<00:06:04.650> I<00:06:04.770> noticed<00:06:05.130> the

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
went pretty good except I noticed the

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.670 
went pretty good except I noticed the
marker<00:06:06.180> bled<00:06:06.539> a<00:06:06.570> little<00:06:06.750> bit<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:07.350> I'll<00:06:07.500> do<00:06:07.650> a

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
marker bled a little bit so I'll do a

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.420 
marker bled a little bit so I'll do a
line<00:06:08.490> here<00:06:08.820> and<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:10.320> will<00:06:10.470> sort<00:06:10.680> of<00:06:10.860> bleed<00:06:11.130> out

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
line here and it will sort of bleed out

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.469 
line here and it will sort of bleed out
of<00:06:11.550> where<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:11.760> originally

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
of where I originally

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.690 
of where I originally
do<00:06:13.320> it

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
do it

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.500 
do it
now<00:06:15.210> look<00:06:15.660> at<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.930> wine<00:06:16.470> and<00:06:16.920> the<00:06:17.310> caps<00:06:18.000> on

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
now look at the wine and the caps on

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.440 
now look at the wine and the caps on
kopecks<00:06:18.960> are<00:06:19.080> pretty<00:06:19.290> accurate<00:06:19.940> this<00:06:20.940> cap<00:06:21.240> is

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
kopecks are pretty accurate this cap is

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.420 
kopecks are pretty accurate this cap is
a<00:06:21.480> little<00:06:21.810> bit<00:06:21.960> darker<00:06:22.350> but<00:06:22.620> it's<00:06:22.980> not<00:06:23.190> that

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
a little bit darker but it's not that

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.400 
a little bit darker but it's not that
much<00:06:23.490> so<00:06:24.360> I'm<00:06:24.930> not<00:06:25.320> gonna<00:06:25.530> complain<00:06:25.950> that<00:06:26.250> much

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
much so I'm not gonna complain that much

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.960 
much so I'm not gonna complain that much
the<00:06:28.410> line<00:06:28.620> is<00:06:28.800> pretty<00:06:28.980> even<00:06:29.460> although<00:06:29.670> there

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
the line is pretty even although there

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.880 
the line is pretty even although there
are<00:06:30.030> some<00:06:30.240> parts<00:06:30.660> where<00:06:30.810> didn't<00:06:31.140> fully<00:06:31.380> go<00:06:31.650> and

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
are some parts where didn't fully go and

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.800 
are some parts where didn't fully go and
that<00:06:31.980> might<00:06:32.130> be<00:06:32.250> my<00:06:32.370> fault<00:06:32.610> though<00:06:32.760> and<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.690> M

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
that might be my fault though and the M

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.480 
that might be my fault though and the M
is<00:06:34.110> pretty<00:06:34.380> awful<00:06:36.530> so<00:06:37.530> now<00:06:37.710> I<00:06:37.740> will<00:06:38.010> grade<00:06:38.340> them

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
is pretty awful so now I will grade them

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.040 
is pretty awful so now I will grade them
based<00:06:38.700> on<00:06:38.880> appearance<00:06:39.390> and<00:06:39.540> how<00:06:39.630> they<00:06:39.750> feel<00:06:39.930> in

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
based on appearance and how they feel in

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.460 
based on appearance and how they feel in
your<00:06:40.140> hand<00:06:40.410> I<00:06:40.650> think<00:06:40.860> by<00:06:41.430> terms<00:06:41.790> of<00:06:41.910> appearance

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
your hand I think by terms of appearance

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.130 
your hand I think by terms of appearance

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
the way kopecks look Copic sketches

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.480 
the way kopecks look Copic sketches
because<00:07:03.930> they<00:07:04.500> only<00:07:04.680> have<00:07:04.920> it<00:07:05.070> on<00:07:05.130> the<00:07:05.250> tape

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
because they only have it on the tape

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.970 
because they only have it on the tape
tip<00:07:05.910> so<00:07:06.180> I'm<00:07:06.390> weird<00:07:06.660> that<00:07:06.750> way<00:07:06.900> sometimes<00:07:07.740> I

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
tip so I'm weird that way sometimes I

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.740 
tip so I'm weird that way sometimes I
like<00:07:08.130> the<00:07:08.280> full<00:07:08.430> thing<00:07:08.700> colored<00:07:09.060> sometimes<00:07:09.420> it

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
like the full thing colored sometimes it

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.710 
like the full thing colored sometimes it
just<00:07:09.930> depends<00:07:10.290> on<00:07:10.410> the<00:07:10.470> marker<00:07:10.800> I<00:07:10.830> guess<00:07:11.390> so

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
just depends on the marker I guess so

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.910 
just depends on the marker I guess so
booboo<00:07:13.350> poor<00:07:13.710> wide<00:07:13.920> he<00:07:14.310> lost<00:07:14.550> this<00:07:14.910> one<00:07:15.150> um<00:07:15.920> and
