00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.059 
this truck
I<00:00:05.720> fixed<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> lights<00:00:06.960> where<00:00:07.290> if<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.740> have<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I fixed the lights where if you have a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.009 
I fixed the lights where if you have a
slower<00:00:08.760> PC<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.570> want<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> cab

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
slower PC and you just want the cab

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.350 
slower PC and you just want the cab
lights<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.370> shows<00:00:11.550> all<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.820> lights<00:00:12.090> on

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
lights on and it shows all the lights on

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.919 
lights on and it shows all the lights on
it<00:00:12.540> does<00:00:12.719> show<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> little<00:00:13.139> white<00:00:14.269> lights<00:00:15.269> but

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
it does show the little white lights but

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.470 
it does show the little white lights but
it<00:00:16.020> doesn't<00:00:16.260> show<00:00:16.379> no<00:00:16.590> actual<00:00:17.160> headlight<00:00:17.520> so

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it doesn't show no actual headlight so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.650 
it doesn't show no actual headlight so
therefore<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.439> won't<00:00:19.650> lag<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.039> too<00:00:20.189> bad<00:00:20.660> all

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
therefore that won't lag it too bad all

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
therefore that won't lag it too bad all
right<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> change<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> sounds<00:00:23.490> I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
right and then I change the sounds I

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759
