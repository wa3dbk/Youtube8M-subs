00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
shortly of how much of a difference it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
shortly of how much of a difference it
makes<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> reason<00:02:04.290> I'm<00:02:04.500> playing

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
makes now the reason I'm playing

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.039 
makes now the reason I'm playing
choosing<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> again<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
choosing the again is because that's the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
choosing the again is because that's the
game<00:02:07.229> i<00:02:07.259> prefer<00:02:07.619> playing<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.009> pc<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.580> because

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
game i prefer playing on pc and because

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.449 
game i prefer playing on pc and because
it<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:09.989> has<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.349> tanker<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.009> tells<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> how

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
it also has the tanker is tells you how

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.010 
it also has the tanker is tells you how
much<00:02:11.640> fringe<00:02:11.879> how<00:02:12.120> many<00:02:12.239> frames<00:02:12.480> per<00:02:12.720> second

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
much fringe how many frames per second

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.490 
much fringe how many frames per second
and<00:02:13.110> getting

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and getting

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
and getting
I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:14.160> pretty<00:02:14.310> cool<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:16.260> lag

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I think that's pretty cool and that lag

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.670 
I think that's pretty cool and that lag
right<00:02:16.680> there<00:02:16.920> wasn't<00:02:17.340> actually<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:18.140> legit<00:02:19.140> type

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
right there wasn't actually a legit type

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.560 
right there wasn't actually a legit type
of<00:02:19.830> lag<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> computer<00:02:21.390> being

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
of lag it was just the computer being

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.060 
of lag it was just the computer being
weird<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.440> computer<00:02:22.770> i<00:02:22.800> mean<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
weird not the computer i mean the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.360 
weird not the computer i mean the
program<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.800> yeah<00:02:25.800> i<00:02:25.830> know<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.250> can

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
three gigahertz it's pretty bad i mean

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.170 
three gigahertz it's pretty bad i mean
that's<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.740> really<00:02:37.950> meant<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:38.190> gaming<00:02:38.610> using

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the frame rates right now it's pretty

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.610 
the frame rates right now it's pretty
good<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.480> mean<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.870> consistent<00:02:52.500> it's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
a lot of cars behind your beside you on

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.220 
a lot of cars behind your beside you on
then<00:03:30.209> you're<00:03:30.360> most<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:30.780> you're<00:03:30.959> obviously

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
then you're most like you're obviously

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.080 
then you're most like you're obviously
going<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.680> lower<00:03:31.890> frame<00:03:32.160> rates<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.730> this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
going to get lower frame rates and this

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.789 
going to get lower frame rates and this
this<00:03:33.480> was<00:03:33.720> enough<00:03:33.900> computer<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.590> was<00:03:34.709> an

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
this was enough computer for this was an

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.630 
this was enough computer for this was an
actual<00:03:34.980> nag<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> game<00:03:35.850> it's<00:03:36.330> pretty<00:03:36.540> weird

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
actual nag in the game it's pretty weird

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.420 
actual nag in the game it's pretty weird
also<00:03:38.640> all<00:03:39.209> i<00:03:39.630> can<00:03:39.930> say<00:03:40.380> league<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.950> legends<00:03:41.280> if

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
also all i can say league of legends if

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.259 
also all i can say league of legends if
you're<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.730> three<00:03:42.000> or<00:03:42.269> 4v<00:03:42.570> or<00:03:43.170> even<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.620> 5v5

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
you're not three or 4v or even a 5v5

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.569 
you're not three or 4v or even a 5v5
battle<00:03:45.269> or<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.630> t-bucket<00:03:45.989> gonna<00:03:46.340> get<00:03:47.340> lower

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
battle or a t-bucket gonna get lower

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.569 
battle or a t-bucket gonna get lower
frame<00:03:47.940> rates<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.530> mean<00:03:49.980> running<00:03:50.400> game

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
frame rates so I mean running game

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.310 
frame rates so I mean running game
booster<00:03:50.790> does<00:03:51.209> significantly<00:03:51.480> help<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.260> as

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
booster does significantly help and as

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.289 
booster does significantly help and as
you<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.560> see<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.860> top<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.310> my<00:03:53.610> frame

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
you can see in the top right my frame

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.509 
you can see in the top right my frame
rates<00:03:54.540> are<00:03:54.660> not<00:03:54.780> consistent<00:03:55.260> at<00:03:55.590> all<00:03:55.769> they<00:03:56.459> are

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
rates are not consistent at all they are

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.600 
rates are not consistent at all they are
dropping<00:03:57.269> up<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.900> down<00:03:58.079> it's<00:03:58.739> more<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.310> 12

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
dropping up and down it's more of a 12

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.430 
dropping up and down it's more of a 12
to<00:03:59.790> 20<00:04:00.239> range<00:04:00.480> i<00:04:00.630> guess<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.140> doesn't<00:04:01.320> even

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
to 20 range i guess but it doesn't even

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.500 
to 20 range i guess but it doesn't even
hit<00:04:01.560> 20<00:04:01.860> frames<00:04:02.010> per<00:04:02.310> second<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.970> much<00:04:03.239> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
hit 20 frames per second that much and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.110 
hit 20 frames per second that much and
it<00:04:04.350> yeah<00:04:04.829> i<00:04:04.860> mean<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.250> experience<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.760> gaming

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
it yeah i mean the experience of gaming

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.759 
it yeah i mean the experience of gaming
isn't<00:04:06.269> as<00:04:06.570> great<00:04:06.810> without<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.380> that's<00:04:07.500> wise

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
isn't as great without and that's wise

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.100 
isn't as great without and that's wise
that's<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.640> conclusion<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.150> come<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.360> with

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
that's a conclusion to come to with

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.170 
that's a conclusion to come to with
razor<00:04:10.350> i<00:04:10.530> mean<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.890> makes<00:04:11.370> difference<00:04:11.880> i<00:04:12.030> mean

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
razor i mean it makes difference i mean

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.270 
razor i mean it makes difference i mean
because<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:13.049> does<00:04:13.230> cut<00:04:13.440> down<00:04:13.560> processes<00:04:14.160> i

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
because it does cut down processes i

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.539 
because it does cut down processes i
mean<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.750> um<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.380> does<00:04:16.620> help<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.950> lot<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.340> mean
