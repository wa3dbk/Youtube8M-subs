 performance that our 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.930

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.719
 passive safety element of the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.299

 a volvo pv544 in August 1959 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.069

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.409
 life until then was reserved 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.420
 for the front seats it was not until 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.090
 the 80 vehicles

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.480
 obviously if you consult it 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.999
 we really have an information to 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.489
 times we use it wrongly as 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:57.650

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.680

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.659

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.549
 only element that you can 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.280
 save life in a frontal crash or in 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.379

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.439

 children but much more important still 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.210
 is that if you have a car with no airbags 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.720
 never stop using the belt 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:45.579
