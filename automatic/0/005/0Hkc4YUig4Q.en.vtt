I'm<00:02:33.010> digging<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.670> game<00:02:33.850> for<00:02:34.210> sure<00:02:34.480> now<00:02:34.960> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
I'm digging the game for sure now the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.590 
I'm digging the game for sure now the
I'm<00:02:36.130> not<00:02:36.250> playing<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.700> at<00:02:36.790> full<00:02:37.090> max<00:02:37.360> settings

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
I'm not playing it at full max settings

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.050 
I'm not playing it at full max settings
because<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.960> actually<00:02:38.080> can't<00:02:38.550> if<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.700> put<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.000> on

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
because I actually can't if I put it on

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.480 
because I actually can't if I put it on
1080p<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.900> put<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.320> actual<00:02:42.220> graphic

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
1080p and put the actual graphic

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.240 
1080p and put the actual graphic
settings<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.210> max<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.810> run<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.470> about<00:02:44.680> 20<00:02:45.040> frames

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
settings to max I run it about 20 frames

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.550 
settings to max I run it about 20 frames
per<00:02:45.520> second<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.300> guess<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.720> playable

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
per second and I guess it's playable

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.160 
per second and I guess it's playable
that<00:02:47.860> way<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.250> certainly<00:02:48.520> not<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:50.020> know<00:02:50.140> I

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
that way it's certainly not a you know I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.270 
that way it's certainly not a you know I
deal<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.190> run<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:51.940> 1600<00:02:52.720> x<00:02:52.840> 900

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
deal so I run it at 1600 x 900

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.760 
deal so I run it at 1600 x 900
resolution<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.300> put<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.200> don't<00:02:56.500> know<00:02:56.620> if

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
two crisis games were very open very

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.260 
two crisis games were very open very
sandbox<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.770> could<00:04:51.919> really<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:53.090> could

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
sandbox and you could really you could

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.240 
sandbox and you could really you could
really<00:04:53.570> do<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.810> lot<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.620> it's<00:04:54.770> not<00:04:54.949> quite<00:04:55.220> the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
really do a lot and it's not quite the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.969 
really do a lot and it's not quite the
same<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.139> is<00:04:57.349> like<00:04:57.470> it's<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.740> little<00:04:57.800> more

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
same and this is like it's a little more

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.650 
same and this is like it's a little more
linear<00:04:58.190> but<00:04:58.699> it's<00:04:58.849> certainly<00:04:58.970> not<00:04:59.180> bad<00:04:59.389> i<00:04:59.419> mean

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
linear but it's certainly not bad i mean

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.480 
linear but it's certainly not bad i mean
it's<00:04:59.810> really<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:00.680> offers<00:05:00.949> you<00:05:01.039> quite<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.280> bit<00:05:01.310> of

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
it's really so offers you quite a bit of

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.189 
it's really so offers you quite a bit of
choice<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:01.910> there's<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.810> couple<00:05:02.960> different

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
choice and there's a couple different

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.969 
you know I am looking forward to playing
some<00:05:31.550> multiplayer<00:05:32.320> although<00:05:33.320> I'm<00:05:33.740> probably

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
some multiplayer although I'm probably

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.620 
some multiplayer although I'm probably
at<00:05:34.310> a<00:05:34.370> disadvantage<00:05:34.550> he's<00:05:35.060> in<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.240> controller

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
at a disadvantage he's in the controller

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.680 
at a disadvantage he's in the controller
and<00:05:36.050> just<00:05:37.039> yeah<00:05:37.550> I'd<00:05:38.240> be<00:05:38.419> at<00:05:38.509> a<00:05:38.539> disadvantage

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
and just yeah I'd be at a disadvantage

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.749 
and just yeah I'd be at a disadvantage
in<00:05:39.050> mouse<00:05:39.320> keyboard<00:05:39.590> also<00:05:39.979> so<00:05:40.460> I'll<00:05:40.610> probably

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
in mouse keyboard also so I'll probably

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.920 
in mouse keyboard also so I'll probably
you<00:05:41.060> know<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.210> doesn't<00:05:41.389> really<00:05:41.479> matter<00:05:41.599> I'll

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.330 
you know it doesn't really matter I'll
play<00:05:42.169> some<00:05:42.199> of<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:42.680> probably<00:05:42.949> won't<00:05:43.130> be<00:05:43.250> able

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
play some of it I probably won't be able

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.010 
play some of it I probably won't be able
to<00:05:43.460> post<00:05:43.639> up<00:05:43.759> any<00:05:43.909> beast<00:05:44.210> scores<00:05:44.570> for<00:05:44.810> you<00:05:44.870> guys

man<00:06:08.750> look<00:06:08.780> at<00:06:08.990> these<00:06:09.110> crafty<00:06:09.530> lictors<00:06:09.860> look<00:06:10.009> at

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
man look at these crafty lictors look at

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.070 
man look at these crafty lictors look at
the<00:06:10.190> work<00:06:10.520> environment<00:06:10.849> oh<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.330> also<00:06:11.539> I'm

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
the work environment oh and also I'm

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.560 
the work environment oh and also I'm
capturing<00:06:12.650> us<00:06:12.800> in<00:06:12.919> fraps<00:06:13.280> at<00:06:13.550> half<00:06:13.820> resolution

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
capturing us in fraps at half resolution

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.689 
capturing us in fraps at half resolution
so<00:06:14.690> it's<00:06:14.840> not<00:06:14.990> going<00:06:15.169> to<00:06:15.259> be<00:06:15.349> quite<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.340> full

resolution for the video it's not going

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.080 
resolution for the video it's not going
to<00:06:18.830> look<00:06:18.889> as<00:06:19.070> quite<00:06:19.370> as<00:06:19.490> good<00:06:19.610> in<00:06:19.729> this<00:06:19.820> video

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090
