efficient<00:02:19.950> weapon<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.489> my<00:02:20.730> opinion<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
efficient weapon in my opinion is the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.750 
efficient weapon in my opinion is the
whip<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.200> makes<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.739> fighting<00:02:23.130> segments<00:02:23.610> a

whip it makes the fighting segments a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.850 
whip it makes the fighting segments a
heck<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.360> lot<00:02:24.510> easier<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:25.050> allows<00:02:25.290> Billy<00:02:25.650> to

heck of a lot easier and allows Billy to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.449
