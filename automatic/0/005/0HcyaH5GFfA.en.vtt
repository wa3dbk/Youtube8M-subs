00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.389 

so<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.260> thought<00:00:01.560> I'd<00:00:01.680> do<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> quick<00:00:01.860> video<00:00:02.340> here

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
so I thought I'd do a quick video here

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.889 
so I thought I'd do a quick video here
just<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.790> show<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.090> mod<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.510> completed

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
just to show you a mod that I completed

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.200 
just to show you a mod that I completed
the<00:00:04.110> other<00:00:04.170> night<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.759> actually<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
the other night and this is actually the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.390 
the other night and this is actually the
second<00:00:06.600> time<00:00:06.629> I've<00:00:06.899> attempted<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> did<00:00:08.370> a

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
second time I've attempted this I did a

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.370 
second time I've attempted this I did a
video<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.910> about<00:00:09.090> two<00:00:09.660> years<00:00:09.929> ago<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.260> think

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
video on it about two years ago I think

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.370 
video on it about two years ago I think
and<00:00:11.240> it<00:00:12.240> worked<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.630> everything<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.230> was

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and it worked on everything but I was

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.730 
and it worked on everything but I was
never<00:00:13.559> 100%<00:00:14.299> happy<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.330> her<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.320> way<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.619> all

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
never 100% happy with her the way it all

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710 
never 100% happy with her the way it all
turned<00:00:17.070> out<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.520> like<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.090> quality<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
turned out just like the quality of the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.620 
turned out just like the quality of the
finish<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.710> mod<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.180> time<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> think

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
finish of the mod but this time I think

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.580 
finish of the mod but this time I think
ever<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> cracked<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.840> worked<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
ever can I cracked it and it worked I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.740 
ever can I cracked it and it worked I
had<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.460> properly<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.630> thought

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
had to do it properly so I just thought

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.500 
had to do it properly so I just thought
I'd<00:00:27.900> quickly<00:00:28.619> show<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and I'll show you how it did it in just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.100 
and I'll show you how it did it in just
a<00:01:14.130> minute<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.580> yeah<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.869> really

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
a minute but yeah I was really really

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
a minute but yeah I was really really
happy<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> all<00:01:17.189> turned<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
happy with the way it all turned out and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.090 
happy with the way it all turned out and
all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> camera's<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.960> focusing<00:01:19.920> too

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
all the camera's not really focusing too

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.010 
all the camera's not really focusing too
well<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.590> they're<00:01:22.970> nice

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
well on it but you see they're nice

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.330 
well on it but you see they're nice
clean<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> even<00:01:27.710> distribution<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:29.159> light

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
clean and even distribution of light

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.710 
clean and even distribution of light
across<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.880> whole<00:01:30.060> screen<00:01:30.329> there's<00:01:30.570> no

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
across the whole screen there's no

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.440 
across the whole screen there's no
blotches<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.470> anything<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
blotches or anything and I think it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
blotches or anything and I think it
looks<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:34.020> cool<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.680> switched

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
looks really cool which is switched

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.319 
looks really cool which is switched
itself<00:01:35.460> off<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:38.060> there<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.150> go

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
itself off so there we go

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.420 
itself off so there we go
just<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> Time<00:01:41.790> Lord

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
just the Time Lord

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.040 
just the Time Lord
so<00:01:43.940> yeah<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.090> was<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.330> really<00:01:44.420> happy<00:01:44.660> with<00:01:44.930> the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
so yeah I was just really happy with the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.720 
so yeah I was just really happy with the
wait<00:01:45.170> time<00:01:45.380> there<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.980> thought<00:01:46.190> I'd<00:01:46.340> do<00:01:46.520> a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
wait time there and I thought I'd do a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.490 
wait time there and I thought I'd do a
quick<00:01:46.790> video<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.540> but<00:01:47.660> I'll<00:01:47.720> show<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.380> how

parts of my fault in at end of the
eslate<00:01:56.720> tox<00:01:57.230> screen<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
eslate tox screen and this is the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.880 
eslate tox screen and this is the
remnants<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.360> screen<00:01:59.750> here<00:02:00.050> this<00:02:00.710> came

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
remnants of that screen here this came

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.800 
remnants of that screen here this came
out<00:02:01.010> of<00:02:01.220> an<00:02:01.340> old<00:02:01.520> console<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.210> repaired

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
out of an old console that I repaired

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.780 
out of an old console that I repaired
awhile<00:02:03.080> back<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.530> think<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:03.920> ribbon<00:02:04.400> cable<00:02:04.700> on

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
awhile back I think with ribbon cable on

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.570 
awhile back I think with ribbon cable on
this<00:02:04.940> had<00:02:05.150> split<00:02:05.870> so<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.710> was<00:02:06.890> basically<00:02:07.370> just

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
this had split so it was basically just

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.120 
this had split so it was basically just
junk<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.020> see<00:02:09.140> I've<00:02:09.259> taken<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.710> back

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
junk but you can see I've taken the back

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.010 
junk but you can see I've taken the back
light<00:02:10.369> modulator<00:02:10.610> here<00:02:11.240> I've<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.510> stripped

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
light modulator here I've just stripped

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.860 
light modulator here I've just stripped
it<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.350> parts<00:02:12.740> this<00:02:13.450> section<00:02:14.450> here<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.630> like

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
it for parts this section here is like

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.830 
it for parts this section here is like
the<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.320> main<00:02:15.560> LCD<00:02:16.340> panel<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.390> backlight

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
the the main LCD panel and the backlight

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.990 
the the main LCD panel and the backlight
it<00:02:17.959> just<00:02:18.170> sets<00:02:18.410> here<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.920> shames<00:02:19.430> light

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
it just sets here and shames light

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.630 
it just sets here and shames light
through<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> I'll<00:02:22.190> show<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.459> what's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
through that so I'll show you what's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.110 
through that so I'll show you what's
left<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:24.430> I've<00:02:25.430> basically<00:02:25.820> cut<00:02:26.030> this

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
left of that and I've basically cut this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.170 
left of that and I've basically cut this
in<00:02:26.300> half<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:26.780> cut<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:28.040> half<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
in half and then cut the half to the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.820 
in half and then cut the half to the
right<00:02:29.330> size<00:02:29.600> or<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:29.990> right<00:02:30.140> dimensions<00:02:30.650> to

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
right size or the right dimensions to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.660 
right size or the right dimensions to
fit<00:02:31.010> behind<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:32.030> VM<00:02:32.360> use<00:02:32.630> an<00:02:33.100> LCD<00:02:34.100> panel

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
fit behind the the VM use an LCD panel

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.020 
fit behind the the VM use an LCD panel
here<00:02:34.970> there's<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.870> enough<00:02:36.140> room<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.590> fit<00:02:37.030> all

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
here there's just enough room to fit all

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.180 
here there's just enough room to fit all
this<00:02:38.390> behind<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.620> was<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.040> lucky

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
this behind that so I was kind of lucky

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.150 
this behind that so I was kind of lucky
but<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.750> actually<00:02:42.080> made<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.560> several

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
but this is actually made up of several

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.820 
but this is actually made up of several
different<00:02:43.670> layers<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.959> pretty<00:02:44.959> color<00:02:45.260> optical

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
different layers of pretty color optical

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.440 
different layers of pretty color optical
materials<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:48.290> first<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:48.800> here<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.100> a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
materials so the first one here is a

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.740 
materials so the first one here is a
mirror<00:02:50.890> file<00:02:51.890> mirror<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.300> just<00:02:53.510> throws

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
mirror file mirror and that just throws

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.320 
mirror file mirror and that just throws
all<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.650> available<00:02:55.070> light<00:02:55.220> forward<00:02:55.790> on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
all the the available light forward on

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.900 
all the the available light forward on
top<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.110> there's<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.860> suppose<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.760> is

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
top of that there's a I suppose this is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.810 
top of that there's a I suppose this is
like<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.209> most<00:02:59.600> important<00:03:00.519> piece<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.760> is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
like the most important piece this is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.380 
like the most important piece this is
called

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
called

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.640 
called
I've<00:03:02.510> got<00:03:02.720> some<00:03:02.900> notes<00:03:03.080> here<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.410> try<00:03:03.590> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I've got some notes here and try to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.050 
I've got some notes here and try to
remember<00:03:03.890> all<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.250> different<00:03:04.790> names<00:03:04.880> for

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
remember all the different names for

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.180 
remember all the different names for
these<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.140> called<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.709> light<00:03:06.920> guide

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
these this is called the light guide

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.870 
these this is called the light guide
plate<00:03:08.080> I'm<00:03:09.080> getting<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.700> is

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
plate I'm getting that right and this is

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.130 
plate I'm getting that right and this is
sort<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:12.230> fiber<00:03:13.130> optic<00:03:13.340> cable<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.750> flat

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
sort of like a fiber optic cable so flat

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.620 
sort of like a fiber optic cable so flat
fiber<00:03:15.500> optic<00:03:15.860> cable<00:03:16.190> would<00:03:16.880> be<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.269> best<00:03:17.450> way

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
fiber optic cable would be the best way

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.120 
fiber optic cable would be the best way
of<00:03:17.660> describing<00:03:18.170> less<00:03:18.530> you've<00:03:18.709> got<00:03:18.920> you've

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
of describing less you've got you've

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.940 
of describing less you've got you've
actually<00:03:19.250> got<00:03:19.550> two<00:03:19.760> little<00:03:20.000> LEDs<00:03:20.950> embedded

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
actually got two little LEDs embedded

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.740 
actually got two little LEDs embedded
into<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.580> cameras<00:03:23.239> probably<00:03:23.510> not<00:03:23.600> going<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
into this cameras probably not going to

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.570 
into this cameras probably not going to
focus<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.350> there<00:03:25.130> you<00:03:25.250> go

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
focus on that there you go

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.750 
focus on that there you go
just<00:03:26.450> LEDs<00:03:27.019> here<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:27.320> actually<00:03:27.620> four<00:03:27.920> right

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
just LEDs here is actually four right

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.340 
just LEDs here is actually four right
across<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.269> whole<00:03:29.480> screen<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.080> there's

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
across this whole screen so there's

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.729 
across this whole screen so there's
there's<00:03:31.280> actually<00:03:31.430> two<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.150> saved<00:03:33.140> my<00:03:33.320> vmu

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
there's actually two and saved my vmu

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.770 
there's actually two and saved my vmu
here<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.130> just<00:03:34.340> see<00:03:34.459> them<00:03:34.640> lift<00:03:35.360> up<00:03:35.540> there

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
here you can just see them lift up there

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.670 
here you can just see them lift up there
so<00:03:36.769> but<00:03:37.430> there's<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.030> light<00:03:38.510> guide<00:03:38.720> plate<00:03:39.080> and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
so but there's the light guide plate and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.220 
so but there's the light guide plate and
that<00:03:39.830> basic<00:03:40.760> throws<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.299> light<00:03:41.750> right<00:03:41.989> across

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
that basic throws the light right across

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.949 
that basic throws the light right across
the<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.920> entire<00:03:43.250> screen<00:03:43.670> on<00:03:44.420> top<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.840> that

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
the the entire screen on top of that

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.680 
the the entire screen on top of that
you've<00:03:45.170> got<00:03:45.200> prism<00:03:45.860> film<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:47.209> gives<00:03:47.540> a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
you've got prism film and this gives a

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.280 
you've got prism film and this gives a
nice<00:03:47.900> white<00:03:48.380> glow<00:03:49.390> that's<00:03:50.390> on<00:03:50.780> top<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.170> that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
nice white glow that's on top of that

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.509 
nice white glow that's on top of that
and<00:03:51.560> then<00:03:51.769> finally<00:03:52.280> you've<00:03:52.459> got

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
and then finally you've got

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.690 
and then finally you've got
I<00:03:53.549> suppose<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.360> final<00:03:54.810> diffuser<00:03:55.319> film<00:03:55.739> and

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
I suppose a final diffuser film and

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.899 
I suppose a final diffuser film and
piece<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.329> match<00:03:57.480> sits<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.079> top<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.670> all<00:03:59.670> of

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
piece of match sits on top of all of

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.619 
piece of match sits on top of all of
these<00:04:00.090> heroes<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.480> makes<00:04:00.659> up<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.989> bit<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.890> a

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
these heroes it makes up a bit of a a

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.530 
these heroes it makes up a bit of a a
backlight<00:04:03.629> module<00:04:04.110> sandwich<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.489> then<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.329> had

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
backlight module sandwich and then I had

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.399 
backlight module sandwich and then I had
to<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:07.610> just<00:04:08.610> had<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.909> wire<00:04:09.840> these<00:04:10.049> up<00:04:10.230> in

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
to I just had to wire these up in

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.160 
to I just had to wire these up in
parallel<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.129> then<00:04:11.340> wire<00:04:12.209> them<00:04:12.420> into<00:04:12.659> the<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
parallel and then wire them into the the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.170 
parallel and then wire them into the the
VM<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.680> hear<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.459> well<00:04:14.670> run<00:04:14.909> off<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
VM you hear so well run off the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390 
VM you hear so well run off the
battery's<00:04:15.569> off<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.019> run<00:04:16.199> off<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.919> console

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
battery's off to run off the the console

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.069 
battery's off to run off the the console
as<00:04:17.519> well<00:04:17.549> I'll<00:04:18.299> show<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.900> a

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
as well I'll show you that in just a

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.960 
as well I'll show you that in just a
moment<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.620> still<00:04:20.579> need<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.820> make<00:04:20.940> some

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
moment I still need to make some

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.270 
moment I still need to make some
improvements<00:04:21.690> than<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.019> but<00:04:22.320> I'll<00:04:23.009> go<00:04:23.130> your

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
improvements than that but I'll go your

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.700 
improvements than that but I'll go your
quick<00:04:23.460> demonstration<00:04:23.669> of<00:04:24.240> how<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:25.139> module

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
quick demonstration of how this module

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.610 
quick demonstration of how this module
works<00:04:26.370> oh<00:04:26.699> I've<00:04:26.910> got<00:04:27.120> some<00:04:27.600> leftovers<00:04:28.350> here<00:04:28.530> of

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
works oh I've got some leftovers here of

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.490 
works oh I've got some leftovers here of
the<00:04:28.970> various<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:31.490> films<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.699> plates<00:04:33.500> and

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
the various and films and plates and

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.969 
the various and films and plates and
just<00:04:34.680> show<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.130> this<00:04:35.340> in<00:04:35.520> action<00:04:35.669> so<00:04:36.979> start

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
just show you this in action so start

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.469 
just show you this in action so start
them<00:04:38.160> all<00:04:38.280> together<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.380> kill<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> lights

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
them all together and kill the lights

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.820 
them all together and kill the lights
so<00:04:42.479> that's<00:04:42.660> material<00:04:43.139> there's<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.470> really<00:04:43.710> good

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
so that's material there's a really good

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.779 
so that's material there's a really good
job<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.900> getting<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.470> nice<00:04:46.650> even<00:04:47.099> glory<00:04:47.520> across

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
job of getting a nice even glory across

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.330 
job of getting a nice even glory across
the<00:04:48.000> screen<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.449> I've<00:04:48.539> got<00:04:48.690> my<00:04:48.780> torch<00:04:49.050> here<00:04:49.340> if

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
the screen so I've got my torch here if

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.370 
the screen so I've got my torch here if
I<00:04:50.430> just<00:04:50.460> shine<00:04:50.789> it<00:04:50.820> down<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.150> one<00:04:51.270> end<00:04:51.479> you'll

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
I just shine it down in one end you'll

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.379 
I just shine it down in one end you'll
see<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.770> takes<00:04:53.009> the<00:04:53.130> way<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:53.729> makes<00:04:54.210> this

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
see it takes the way and it makes this

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.020 
see it takes the way and it makes this
nice<00:04:54.710> dust<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.919> there<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:57.180> makes<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.570> nice<00:04:57.720> and

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
nice dust on there it makes a nice and

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.850 
nice dust on there it makes a nice and
quite<00:05:00.030> glow<00:05:00.389> so<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.199> works<00:05:01.410> really<00:05:01.620> well

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
quite glow so that works really well

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.800 
quite glow so that works really well
when<00:05:02.130> you're<00:05:02.330> wanting<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.360> use<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.690> for

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
when you're wanting to use it for

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.129 
when you're wanting to use it for
something<00:05:04.020> like<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.789> backlit<00:05:05.789> LCD<00:05:06.210> screen<00:05:06.960> it

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
something like a backlit LCD screen it

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.810 
something like a backlit LCD screen it
is<00:05:07.169> here<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:09.530> yeah<00:05:10.530> that's<00:05:10.860> basically<00:05:11.400> how

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
is here so yeah that's basically how

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.240 
is here so yeah that's basically how
it's<00:05:12.210> all<00:05:12.389> wired<00:05:12.720> up<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.169> I'm<00:05:13.620> not<00:05:13.800> wired<00:05:13.979> up

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
it's all wired up and I'm not wired up

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.640 
it's all wired up and I'm not wired up
but<00:05:14.940> that's<00:05:15.120> her<00:05:15.270> whole<00:05:15.570> being<00:05:16.260> assembled

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
but that's her whole being assembled

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.730 
but that's her whole being assembled
there's<00:05:17.639> not<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.300> huge<00:05:19.110> amount<00:05:19.199> of<00:05:19.500> space<00:05:19.710> to

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
there's not a huge amount of space to

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.120 
there's not a huge amount of space to
work<00:05:19.949> with<00:05:20.099> behind<00:05:20.639> this<00:05:21.590> LCD<00:05:22.590> panel<00:05:22.979> here

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
work with behind this LCD panel here

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.000 
work with behind this LCD panel here
there's<00:05:23.340> just<00:05:23.400> enough<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.270> fit<00:05:24.530> all<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.590> these

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
there's just enough to fit all of these

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.420 
there's just enough to fit all of these
different<00:05:26.460> layers<00:05:26.669> and<00:05:26.970> no<00:05:27.840> more<00:05:28.220> wiring<00:05:29.220> it

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
different layers and no more wiring it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.710 
different layers and no more wiring it
up<00:05:29.490> is<00:05:29.699> a<00:05:29.729> little<00:05:29.909> tricky

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
up is a little tricky

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.149 
up is a little tricky
and<00:05:31.909> as<00:05:32.909> I<00:05:33.090> say<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.330> have<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.539> wire<00:05:34.020> up<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.440> two

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
and as I say you have to wire up the two

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.070 
and as I say you have to wire up the two
LEDs<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.740> this<00:05:37.740> plate<00:05:38.070> here<00:05:38.460> in<00:05:39.080> parallel

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
LEDs and the this plate here in parallel

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.010 
LEDs and the this plate here in parallel
and<00:05:40.349> that<00:05:40.380> can<00:05:41.250> be<00:05:41.400> quite<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:41.880> difficult<00:05:42.690> task

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
and that can be quite a difficult task

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.689 
and that can be quite a difficult task
to<00:05:43.699> the<00:05:44.699> size<00:05:45.030> of<00:05:45.210> these<00:05:45.380> LEDs<00:05:46.380> there<00:05:46.860> tiny

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
to the size of these LEDs there tiny

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.930 
to the size of these LEDs there tiny
tiny<00:05:48.000> little<00:05:48.590> components<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:50.520> then<00:05:50.669> you<00:05:50.789> have

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
tiny little components and then you have

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.330 
tiny little components and then you have
to<00:05:51.120> wire<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:52.110> into<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.650> main<00:05:52.949> board<00:05:53.220> of

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
to wire it into the the main board of

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.060 
to wire it into the the main board of
the<00:05:53.400> game<00:05:53.909> you<00:05:54.120> as<00:05:54.210> well<00:05:54.419> so<00:05:54.810> not<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.800> easiest

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
the game you as well so not the easiest

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.700 
the game you as well so not the easiest
thing<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.340> do<00:05:56.610> but<00:05:56.639> I<00:05:57.150> think<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:58.050> worth<00:05:58.380> it

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
thing to do but I think it's is worth it

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.940 
thing to do but I think it's is worth it
I'll<00:05:59.280> show<00:05:59.490> you<00:05:59.550> a<00:05:59.880> hooked<00:06:00.539> up<00:06:00.750> to<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.110> console

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
I'll show you a hooked up to the console

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.620 
I'll show you a hooked up to the console
and

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
and

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.200
