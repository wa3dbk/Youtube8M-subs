00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
probably not brilliant if you want a
shot<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> me<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> need<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> lose<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.140> house

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
shot of me we need to lose the house

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.480 
shot of me we need to lose the house
how'd<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
how'd you do that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.420 
how'd you do that
move<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.060> camera<00:01:39.299> again<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.590> lower<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
move the camera again so if we lower the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
move the camera again so if we lower the
camera<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.229> while<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.710> need<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> be

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
camera down all the while you need to be

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.039 
camera down all the while you need to be
looking<00:01:44.460> around<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.970> viewfinder<00:01:45.659> making

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
looking around that viewfinder making

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.380 
looking around that viewfinder making
little<00:01:46.229> adjustments<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.100> movements<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.850> as

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
little adjustments and movements and as

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.330 
little adjustments and movements and as
you<00:01:48.630> fiddle<00:01:48.990> around<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.530> move<00:01:49.680> stuff<00:01:49.950> about

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
you fiddle around and move stuff about

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850 
you fiddle around and move stuff about
you'll<00:01:50.909> find<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> place<00:01:51.570> where<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.560> lose

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you'll find a place where we can lose

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
you'll find a place where we can lose
the<00:01:53.130> house<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> components

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the house and just get the components

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
the house and just get the components
that<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.130> make<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.460> interesting

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that you want to make an interesting

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
that you want to make an interesting
composition<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.530> you've<00:01:58.770> got<00:01:58.860> quite<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
composition so now you've got quite a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
composition so now you've got quite a
dramatic<00:01:59.340> sort<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> an<00:02:00.149> image<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.570> me<00:02:00.840> against

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
dramatic sort of an image of me against

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.039 
dramatic sort of an image of me against
the<00:02:01.500> sky<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.880> isn't<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> button<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.780> push

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the sky this isn't a button you can push

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.200 
the sky this isn't a button you can push
this<00:02:04.229> isn't<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> menu<00:02:04.979> setting<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.060> all

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this isn't a menu setting this is all

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540 
this isn't a menu setting this is all
outside<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.079> camera<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:08.220> you

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
outside of the camera this is about you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.350 
outside of the camera this is about you
not<00:02:08.879> being

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
not being

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.170 
not being
easy<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.960> moving<00:02:10.860> yourself<00:02:11.250> around<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.940> try

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
easy and moving yourself around and try

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.210 
easy and moving yourself around and try
and<00:02:12.360> stuff<00:02:12.600> out<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.140> find<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.560> composition

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and stuff out to find the composition

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.120 
and stuff out to find the composition
that<00:02:14.250> works<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.910> you
