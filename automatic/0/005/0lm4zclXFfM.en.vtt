00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
lacking in this episode to me was the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.360 
lacking in this episode to me was the
the<00:00:59.879> animation<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.989> fights<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the animation and the fights really the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.840 
the animation and the fights really the
fight<00:01:02.579> sent<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.329> underwhelming<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.850> slow

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
fight sent really underwhelming and slow

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.320 
fight sent really underwhelming and slow
and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:07.049> didn't<00:01:07.350> feel<00:01:08.030> excited<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.210> all

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and I really didn't feel excited at all

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
and I really didn't feel excited at all
about<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.049> fights<00:01:10.260> even<00:01:10.560> though<00:01:10.619> some

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
about these fights even though some

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
about these fights even though some
pretty<00:01:11.040> exciting<00:01:11.549> stuff<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:12.060> happening<00:01:12.299> it

pretty exciting stuff was happening it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
pretty exciting stuff was happening it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
felt like it was held back by the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.109 
felt like it was held back by the
animation<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.310> everything<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.460> felt<00:01:17.759> slow

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
animation and everything just felt slow

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690
