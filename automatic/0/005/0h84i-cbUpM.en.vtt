00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.880
 A lot of people are interested in the question of how can 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.280
 save fuel 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.410
 is it necessary to save it what should be 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.809
 consumption on cars at some expense 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.279
 I will say a very small powder move on the contrary 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.840
 very big or it just seems 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.910
 people so how can you save 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.570
 fuel or how to ask a question 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.079
 how to drive so that the engine ate like 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.110
 can I have less fuel now I'm going to 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.489
 cars ford focus with 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.640
 manual transmission 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.340
 let's see what we have now 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.030
 fuel consumption on the trip computer 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.880
 what he shows car 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.490
 rises uphill and if i give now 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.670
 full gas, see what fruit consumption 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.670
 but 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.300
 what we get flow 19 20 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.070
 liters 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.439
 now I opposite let go completely 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.140
 gas pedal and braking mode 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.720
 engine 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:16.289
 flow is 0 in braking mode 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.759
 engine consumption 0 in the summer is now new 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.259
 slightly pressing the gas pedal 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.890
 about 10 percent and as you can see by 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890
 testimony 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.350
 the readings vary greatly in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 whichever 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:43.320
 how sharp and how much you pressed 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:47.410
 the gas pedal is now missed consumption 0 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.170
 consumable machine just roll in mode 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.330
 engine braking neutral not 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.180
 turn on if we turn on neutral 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.680
 the transfer is what will happen 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.760
 the engine will go into idle mode 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.150
 and consumption will be at least half a liter as 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.390
 at least half a liter idle mode 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.910
 turn on the transfer again and start 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.470
 accelerate what's going on full 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 gas and distance on the emphasis is pressed here with us 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.310
 happens of course we start to catch up 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.860
 and distill everything before us 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.100
 car this while consumption saw 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 up to 16 liters again threw off the gas and again 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.750
 on this way you can save 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.700
 fuel just by not pressing once again on 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.900
 gas pedal now we're a little bit 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 we leave on one 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.220
 moments of the year we get 36 consumption 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.150
 now the pedal is able 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.530
 when she lightly pressed the car goes 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.080
 down the hill and you see 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.160
 expense we have here and so in this way 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.790
 we can save 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.690
 a lot of fuel is an interesting example 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.640
 came 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.960
 do uaz hunter driver 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.530
 a very big expense man complained 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.590
 on the big unraveled ask how many 18 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.600
 years to 10 big let's see what 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 we have going on 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.080
 We catch the trip computer that is 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:26.690
 diagnostics scanner and go it turns out that 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.190
 while driving, that's when he 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.840
 need to slow down a little 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.510
 he was in neutral and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:38.920
 rolling at the same expense at idle 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:42.590
 UAZ was somewhere 091 whether there 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.260
 almost a liter is a leader that he could 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.930
 save well how come we now 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.780
 ride so put him your laptop 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.490
 on the dashboard and say come on now 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.790
 accelerates ares when spool and he 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:06.150
 25 liters immediately showed consumption 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.010
 immediately 25 meters and now that's how we 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.890
 something like this is happening now or 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.840
 let's ask the gas pedal releasing 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.180
 when the throttle into neutral not include 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.359
 and what was his surprise when he 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.220
 saw but liters so funny once 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.289
 I saw how touching that can so goes 10 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.910
 weeks and this man who came 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.120
 naturally thanked me for this 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.830
 the lesson was of course very nice so 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.490
 guys if you have a manual 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.560
 gears 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.840
 you can save on fuel consumption 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.820
 but percent dance you can easily 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.889
 save 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.860
 just know that in mode 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:48.360
 braking release the gas pedal 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.099
 you already save fuel congratulations to you 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.800
 with this discovery knew about it 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.960
 great once again remember good luck to you on 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.099
 roads auto repair of the world as a 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.099
 bitterly 52
