00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.770
 simple 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.990
 from beginning to end 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello welcome new mechanical video my 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.770
 name is Jesus and we will see the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.360
 training a thermostat if you 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.010
 Interested in knowing more about the central theme 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.449
 the web of roles where you'll find all 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.990
 more extensive information about 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.360
 thermostat 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 also if you need spare parts to cancel 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.070
 or delay your vehicle you can access 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 from the web and without moving from home 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.950
 Our vehicle's thermostat serves 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.710
 to maintain the working temperature 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.629
 of the engine its operation is based on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 letting water pass to the radiator 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.350
 engine when necessary when your 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 temperature increases it gets dilate 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.000
 and let the water pass to the radiator of the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 engine so that it is refrigerated let's 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 see how the thermostat works like 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.110
 we can see the thermostats in their 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.820
 resting position are closed when 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 that increase the temperature since here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 we have the stock with what increases the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.420
 coolant temperature makes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.670
 Dilate the pier to contract and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.829
 we started to have water passage towards the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 radiator against more temperature we have 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 here more will shrink the pier and more 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.700
 flow will happen to the radiator of the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.799
 engine 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.289
 the location of the thermostat is the cylinder head 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.000
 at the engine coolant outlet 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.429
 to the radiator and enter the part 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.350
 superior of the winner the thermostat can 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.179
 have two possible breakdowns other than that 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.939
 can lose refrigerant for some of 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.229
 the joints or by some sleeve is a 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.659
 of breakdowns steel with the thermostat 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.390
 stay closed which would cause 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.460
 the water did not come out of the head gasket 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.710
 towards the radiator and it would cause the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.060
 engine temperature will increase if not 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.380
 we realize through the clock the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
 sweet bato that we carry in the box 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 It would make the world warmed in 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.619
 excess and we could blow up the board of 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.110
 plates against if the problem that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.150
 we have is that it is open would happen 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.500
 always water to the radiator and the 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.780
 temperature not all on the beach should we 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.700
 Lowering this failure will be less noticeable when 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.270
 we go by city since when going to low 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.630
 speed 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.610
 the engine warms up all the water and what 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.350
 we would not have had that problem 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.880
 so much that it is closed as this 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.729
 will cause consumption to be higher 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.899
 of the vehicle and especially in winter if 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.060
 it stays open we will notice that the 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.459
 heating or new web or very hot 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.929
 little the one of cervantes that you will find 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.480
 below this video you can even though the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.190
 information about thermostats being 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.390
 here you will enter our website and in 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.430
