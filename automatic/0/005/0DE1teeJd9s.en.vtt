 would like to read and in any case 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 Of course, the book is a book of things for the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.410
 May I do not have it here yet 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.359
 but it is snow as ash god i 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.910
 the cover here as the reading from the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.189
 we together with ingrid link you can find 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 and in the infobox and the end of the month 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 will there be a hang out again ? 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 where we discuss the book and we 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 Advertise the group all the time 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.610
 talk about it together like us 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 Like what was stupid was also good to us 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.660
 stop and immediately so who has fun with 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.579
 We should read ourselves together 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.700
 quickly get that well left is down 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.280
 and yamaha do not continue with the books 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.840
 so this is what they have to do first 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.969
 I wanted to do that last time 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 but I had to read that way 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.820
 They explained to us exemplarily that they 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 did not come to it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 then I hope that this time 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 It can be read by cynthia 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.220
 hand like dark flames 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 that was completely stupid on youtube 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.150
 and it's definitely up to me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 one year from the so called and I have them 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.090
 I did not take that in hand 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.009
 wants the now incredibly happy times 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.180

 Comments say I believe it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.490
 That's why engel.de lives a lot 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 Angel and I are not that fanatic 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.159
 of angels in books only angels are for 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.479
 I 'm not afraid of me but me 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.890

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.830
 It manages to find this monthly cover 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.100
 very pretty 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.480
 and really appeals to me so I am happy 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.310
 I'm in a hurry and I think so 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.120
 that's going to happen next 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.340
 read then I came out 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.990
 a book every time I go in 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.810
 think of passing my bookshelf 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.140
 oh yes, we have to read this two of us 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.600
 we still have it in front of us but me 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 take it somehow in the hand it is 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.430
 even chemistry is still shrink-wrapped and indeed 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.850
 is the house of secrets of 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.280
 christoffers and nice as zini is yes 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.430
 by the director of harry potter and percy 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.430
 Jackson 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.530
 yes, there are so many here and now 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.140
 definitely read it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.410
 it's the second band from i find it 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.700
 but so great and I'm so excited 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.260
 the g hope this is a great 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.970
 Adventure novel as an apparently very 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.980
 be written childlike but I hope 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.570
 It's a bit winter 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.160
 comes in between does not talk 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.810
 must make an effort to live 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.510
 I think so too 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.730
 shown by jason segal nightmare 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.959
 first volume and book should appear 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.730
 dark lights 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.470
 It may be good that I have the book too 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.930
 I read in my last assembled 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.050
 as well as house of secrets run 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.090
 I pass each time and then think 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.010
 I'll take you with my little bed 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 I do not know, I'm super 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.900
 curious about it there are also beautiful 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.910
 song to the book I just see is one 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.890
 my favorite actor and I am 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.360
 but it was not so pleasant 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.640
 then I have a bit of dons copy 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.110
 get and as always more readers month 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.000
 I've seen myself once again 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.130
 so a little thawed as a decent 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.480
 clearly still throw a protection 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.880
 get functional copy 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.769
 and 2 of gabriela m an apple 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.019
 blossom magic and I thought okay 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.730
 after I now in the last month 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.190
 Great to have read 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.170
 maybe I'll read the new one 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.420
 extend 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.880
 maybe he can do the same for me 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.500
 I hope so, and I love that 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.180
 in this swing i want the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.820
 Of course, make full use of the momentum 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 and the book also at hand 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.030
 I assume I hope they hope to the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.530
 last book I like very much 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.169
 wants to read knows lies so long 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.669
 a swamp and I have now 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.500
 pathologies ended that's why I thought 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.200
 okay you can do it a new series 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.990
 start and that for the children that 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.720
 It looks awfully cool, too 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.430
 ribbons are so metallic I have too 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.570
 five volumes are already here 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.510
 That's the adventure now, I think 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.889
 this is the first band theme publisher 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.930

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.280

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.320
 I would like to write that too 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.970

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.570

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.139

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.160
