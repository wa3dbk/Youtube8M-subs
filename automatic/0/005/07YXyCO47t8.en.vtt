nicer<00:00:35.850> ratchet<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.660> possibly<00:00:37.080> looking<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.470> one

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
nicer ratchet or possibly looking at one

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500 
nicer ratchet or possibly looking at one
of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.740> convenience<00:00:38.250> systems<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.330> going<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of the convenience systems I'm going to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
of the convenience systems I'm going to
speak<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.810> in<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> little<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.610> those<00:00:41.610> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
speak about in a little bit those are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.050 
speak about in a little bit those are
the<00:00:41.850> three<00:00:42.090> basic<00:00:42.780> categories<00:00:44.060> specifically

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
the three basic categories specifically

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.640 
the three basic categories specifically
once<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.450> move<00:00:45.600> into<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> binding<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.500> got

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
once we move into the binding you got

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.160 
once we move into the binding you got
some<00:00:46.860> different<00:00:47.070> parts<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.580> consider<00:00:48.170> first

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
some different parts to consider first

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.850 
some different parts to consider first
off<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:50.220> ratchet<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.900> traditional<00:00:52.530> way<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
off the ratchet is a traditional way of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
off the ratchet is a traditional way of
closing<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> binding<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:54.990> a<00:00:55.020> simple

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
closing the binding you got a simple

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.930 
closing the binding you got a simple
throw<00:00:55.590> arm<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.040> tightens<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.700> then<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
throw arm that tightens it and then a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.930 
throw arm that tightens it and then a
release<00:00:57.270> lever<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.140> will<00:00:58.290> release<00:00:58.650> it<00:00:58.940> as

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
release lever that will release it as

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.210 
release lever that will release it as
you<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.360> in<00:01:00.600> price<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:01.530> systems<00:01:02.010> will

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
you go up in price these systems will

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.520 
you go up in price these systems will
become<00:01:02.400> smoother<00:01:03.120> they'll<00:01:03.990> catch<00:01:04.199> less

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
become smoother they'll catch less

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
become smoother they'll catch less
they'll<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:05.009> easier<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.150> typically

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
they'll be easier to use and typically

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.120 
they'll be easier to use and typically
you'll<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:06.870> weight<00:01:07.230> reduction<00:01:07.800> as<00:01:07.950> well

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you'll see weight reduction as well

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
you'll see weight reduction as well
since<00:01:08.790> metal<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.300> employed<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> lot<00:01:10.050> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
since metal is employed in a lot of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.570 
since metal is employed in a lot of
these<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.830> higher<00:01:11.040> end<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:11.490> gonna

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
these as you go higher end you're gonna

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.380 
these as you go higher end you're gonna

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
look for something that has the 3d

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.300 
look for something that has the 3d
contouring<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.229> meaning<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.010> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
contouring to it meaning that it's

obviously<00:04:53.380> carbon<00:04:54.250> you're<00:04:54.610> looking<00:04:54.850> at

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
obviously carbon you're looking at

obviously carbon you're looking at
something<00:04:55.120> that's<00:04:55.240> gonna<00:04:55.449> be<00:04:55.630> very<00:04:55.660> very

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
something that's gonna be very very
