00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
ya the lid comes off really easy because

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.360 
ya the lid comes off really easy because
oh<00:05:18.169> it's<00:05:19.169> missing<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> hinge<00:05:19.889> right<00:05:20.100> there

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.750 
oh it's missing the hinge right there
that<00:05:21.300> one<00:05:21.450> is<00:05:21.479> enough<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.919> if<00:05:23.160> one<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.580> these

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
that one is enough and if one of these

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.510 
that one is enough and if one of these
hinges<00:05:24.090> breaks<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.960> whole<00:05:25.139> lid<00:05:25.470> won't<00:05:26.160> stay

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520

hinges breaks the whole lid won't stay
on<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.760> bin<00:05:26.970> at<00:05:27.180> all<00:05:27.360> so<00:05:28.460> that's<00:05:29.460> unfortunate

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.800 

but<00:05:35.070> what<00:05:35.370> can<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:35.550> do<00:05:36.320> this<00:05:37.320> strange<00:05:37.800> then

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
but what can you do this strange then

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.060 
but what can you do this strange then
losing<00:05:39.810> anything<00:05:40.020> like<00:05:40.320> this<00:05:40.500> one<00:05:40.770> it's<00:05:40.950> like

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
losing anything like this one it's like

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.830 
losing anything like this one it's like
a<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:42.270> know<00:05:42.360> one<00:05:42.539> of<00:05:42.570> those<00:05:42.690> step<00:05:43.020> on<00:05:43.200> bins<00:05:44.840> but

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
a you know one of those step on bins but

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.120 
a you know one of those step on bins but
it's<00:05:46.020> cool<00:05:46.200> because<00:05:46.380> that's<00:05:46.650> like<00:05:46.979> the

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
it's cool because that's like the

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.520 
it's cool because that's like the
equivalent<00:05:47.220> size<00:05:47.940> of<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.180> manual<00:05:48.570> bin<00:05:48.720> or<00:05:49.500> the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
equivalent size of a manual bin or the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.310 
equivalent size of a manual bin or the
