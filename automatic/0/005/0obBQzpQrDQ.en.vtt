00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.980 

okay<00:00:01.319> hello<00:00:01.800> YouTube<00:00:02.159> um<00:00:02.429> while<00:00:03.179> back<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.780> got<00:00:03.959> a

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay hello YouTube um while back I got a

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.619 
okay hello YouTube um while back I got a
harddrive<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:05.460> took<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.730> apart<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.240> I

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
harddrive and I took it apart and I

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.849 
harddrive and I took it apart and I
wanted<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> figure<00:00:07.170> out<00:00:07.379> how<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> run<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
wanted to figure out how to run the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.290 
wanted to figure out how to run the
motor<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.280> because<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.820> know<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.120> got

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
motor on it because you know it's got

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.320 
motor on it because you know it's got
really<00:00:09.510> high<00:00:09.719> RPMs<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.790> and<00:00:11.790> finding<00:00:12.179> out

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
really high RPMs on it and finding out

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.539 
really high RPMs on it and finding out
actually<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> power<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> kind<00:00:14.460> of

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
actually how to power it is kind of

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.460 
actually how to power it is kind of
difficult<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> put<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.350> video

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
difficult so I'm going to put up a video

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.210 
difficult so I'm going to put up a video
on<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.949> um<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.600> kind<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.830> more

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
on it um this is kind of a more

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.550 
on it um this is kind of a more
expensive<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.510> iffy<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.380> doing

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
expensive way like iffy I'm just doing

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.640 
expensive way like iffy I'm just doing
it<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.769> way<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> parts<00:00:23.820> um

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
it this way because I have the parts um

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.509 
it this way because I have the parts um
I'm<00:00:25.650> actually<00:00:25.830> usually<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.580> RC<00:00:27.420> parts<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.519> got

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I'm actually usually not RC parts or got

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.970 
I'm actually usually not RC parts or got
my<00:00:29.670> remote<00:00:29.849> control<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.320> here's<00:00:31.830> my

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
my remote control here and here's my

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.180 
my remote control here and here's my
receiver<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.950> when

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
receiver and what I want to do is when

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.610 
receiver and what I want to do is when
you<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.340> apart<00:00:35.790> both<00:00:36.149> back<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> front<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
you take apart both back and front of

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.520 
you take apart both back and front of
the<00:00:40.620> hard<00:00:40.829> drive<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.820> back<00:00:42.059> will<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:43.020> chip

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the hard drive the back will have a chip

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
the hard drive the back will have a chip
and<00:00:43.800> hopefully<00:00:44.550> three<00:00:44.910> prompts<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> motor

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and hopefully three prompts on the motor

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.049 
and hopefully three prompts on the motor
so<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.410> five<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so I'm have like five I think and I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.610 
so I'm have like five I think and I
don't<00:00:48.149> know<00:00:48.360> how<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> power<00:00:48.750> those<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.320> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
don't know how to power those but this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.459 
don't know how to power those but this
is<00:00:49.770> C<00:00:50.730> solder<00:00:51.059> i<00:00:51.420> soldered<00:00:51.750> three<00:00:51.989> wires<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
is C solder i soldered three wires so

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
is C solder i soldered three wires so
all<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.059> connections<00:00:56.570> then<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.020> had<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
all the connections then you had to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.939 
all the connections then you had to
figure<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:58.770> one's<00:00:59.070> the<00:01:00.440> speed<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
figure out which one's the speed the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.969 
figure out which one's the speed the
negative<00:01:02.390> positive<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.290> figure<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.799> out

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
negative positive so I figure that out

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.789 
negative positive so I figure that out
you<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.970> testing<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.650> what

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you just do that my testing and so what

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.539 
you just do that my testing and so what
I<00:01:07.830> did<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.460> took<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.380> ESC<00:01:10.380> electronic<00:01:11.310> speed

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I did is I took a ESC electronic speed

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.859 
I did is I took a ESC electronic speed
controller<00:01:12.830> yes<00:01:13.830> say<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.880> wrong<00:01:15.060> but

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
controller yes say that wrong but

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.890 
controller yes say that wrong but
electronic<00:01:16.470> speed<00:01:16.680> controller<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.580> just

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
electronic speed controller and I just

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.210 
electronic speed controller and I just
took<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.380> wires<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.799> are<00:01:19.860> supposed<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.130> go

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
took the wires that are supposed to go

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480 
took the wires that are supposed to go
to<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> RC<00:01:21.119> motor<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.110> attach<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to a RC motor and just attach them to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.630 
to a RC motor and just attach them to
the<00:01:23.640> three<00:01:23.880> leads<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.549> motor<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the three leads of the motor and then

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
the three leads of the motor and then
I'm<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.210> writing<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.630> off<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I'm going to be just writing this off of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:43.800 
I'm going to be just writing this off of
800<00:01:32.009> million<00:01:32.430> app<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.909> battery<00:01:34.070> so

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.080 

okay<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.310> don't<00:01:46.310> know<00:01:46.430> if<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.580> hear<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.880> beat

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
okay I don't know if you hear that beat

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.760 
okay I don't know if you hear that beat
but<00:01:47.330> I<00:01:47.360> made<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.600> really<00:01:47.810> really<00:01:47.930> quiet<00:01:48.560> beep

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.300 

okay

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
okay

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.280 
okay
then<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.540> just<00:01:56.570> actually<00:01:56.900> use<00:01:57.140> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
then I can just actually use the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.020 
then I can just actually use the
throttle<00:01:57.710> on<00:01:57.830> my<00:01:58.010> remote<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.520> control<00:01:58.550> it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
throttle on my remote to control it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.980 
throttle on my remote to control it
which<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.360> pretty<00:01:59.510> cool

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
which is pretty cool

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:17.260 
which is pretty cool
this<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.230> variable<00:02:08.080> that's<00:02:09.080> at<00:02:09.229> full<00:02:09.440> speed

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.070 

so<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.290> now<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:20.330> know<00:02:20.480> how<00:02:20.570> have<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.960> go

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
so it's now I don't know how have to go

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.160 
so it's now I don't know how have to go
there<00:02:21.350> on<00:02:21.440> how<00:02:21.590> they<00:02:21.650> need<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> check<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> RPM

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
there on how they need to check the RPM

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.870 
there on how they need to check the RPM
but<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.440> actually<00:02:24.590> run<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.490> really

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
but you can actually run a really really

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.090 
but you can actually run a really really
well<00:02:26.000> speeds<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:28.610> that's<00:02:29.830> that's<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
well speeds I think that's that's the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:41.180 
well speeds I think that's that's the
most<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.460> think<00:02:31.490> I'll<00:02:31.760> probably<00:02:32.030> go

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.900 

yeah<00:02:41.820> that's<00:02:41.970> really<00:02:45.680> that's<00:02:46.700> basically<00:02:47.700> how

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
yeah that's really that's basically how

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.590 
yeah that's really that's basically how
you<00:02:47.940> power<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:48.960> way<00:02:49.170> um<00:02:50.390> another<00:02:51.390> way<00:02:51.570> I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
you power it one way um another way I

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.140 
you power it one way um another way I
mean<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> can<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:52.320> get<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.650> electronic<00:02:53.520> speed

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
mean you can just get a electronic speed

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.410 
mean you can just get a electronic speed
controller<00:02:55.520> which<00:02:56.520> are<00:02:56.700> now<00:02:57.150> they're<00:02:57.300> not

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
controller which are now they're not

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.440 
controller which are now they're not
that<00:02:57.630> expensive<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.700> what<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.820> can<00:02:59.970> do<00:03:00.090> you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that expensive and what you can do you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.610 
that expensive and what you can do you
can<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:00.750> make<00:03:01.020> assertive<00:03:01.470> real

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
can actually make assertive real

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.990 
can actually make assertive real
controller<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.400> won't<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
controller so you won't have to have a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.080 
controller so you won't have to have a
receiver<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:03.990> controller<00:03:04.730> that's<00:03:05.730> probably

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
receiver or a controller that's probably

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.760 
receiver or a controller that's probably
the<00:03:06.240> easiest<00:03:06.570> way<00:03:06.830> but<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:09.630> think<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.380> can<00:03:10.560> use

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
the easiest way but I think you can use

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.760 
the easiest way but I think you can use
I<00:03:11.490> think<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.150> use<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> PWM<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> power<00:03:13.590> these

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
I think you can use a PWM to power these

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.210 
I think you can use a PWM to power these
two<00:03:14.010> which<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> PWM<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:16.470> something

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
two which I have a PWM but something

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.440 
two which I have a PWM but something
went<00:03:17.340> wrong<00:03:17.520> with<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:17.880> don't<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.270> what<00:03:18.360> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
went wrong with it I don't know what it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
went wrong with it I don't know what it
is<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.630> think<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.050> group<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.950> know<00:03:20.160> what

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
is I think I group I don't know what

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.660 
is I think I group I don't know what
happened<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.370> wasn't<00:03:23.700> able<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.120> test<00:03:24.360> that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
happened so I wasn't able to test that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.600 
happened so I wasn't able to test that
so<00:03:26.670> if<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.930> video<00:03:28.110> helped<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.650> lot<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.430> you
