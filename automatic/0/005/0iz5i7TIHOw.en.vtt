a<00:00:35.280> broom<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:37.620> would<00:00:37.739> sleep<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a broom and I would sleep this thing and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.720 
a broom and I would sleep this thing and
you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.480> pretty<00:00:39.899> clean

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
you can see that it's now pretty clean

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.100 
you can see that it's now pretty clean
ok<00:00:41.730> there's<00:00:42.030> still<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> rocks<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
ok there's still a lot of rocks but I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.029 
ok there's still a lot of rocks but I
went<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.760> swept<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.570> there's

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
went and I really swept it so there's

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.209 
went and I really swept it so there's
really<00:00:47.039> before<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:49.219> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
really before it was more like this it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
really before it was more like this it's
more<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.760> scoops<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> stones<00:00:51.510> back

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
more like that scoops the stones back

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.119 
more like that scoops the stones back
now<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:53.430> been<00:00:53.640> swept<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.840> i

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
now it's been swept and you can see i

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.900 
now it's been swept and you can see i
have<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.730> kinds<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
have here all kinds of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.299 
have here all kinds of
a<00:00:58.970> little<00:00:59.630> cracks<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.640> they're<00:01:02.390> everywhere

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
a little cracks and they're everywhere

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.950 
a little cracks and they're everywhere
and<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:04.760> think<00:01:04.820> that's<00:01:05.150> exactly<00:01:05.660> where<00:01:05.870> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
and I think that's exactly where the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.090 
and I think that's exactly where the
leaks<00:01:06.140> are<00:01:06.260> coming<00:01:06.530> from<00:01:06.820> there's<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.090> Matt

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.140 

and<00:01:12.100> there<00:01:12.730> is<00:01:12.820> one<00:01:13.060> little<00:01:13.240> spot<00:01:13.720> right<00:01:13.750> there

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and there is one little spot right there

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.940 
and there is one little spot right there
and<00:01:16.150> then<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:16.570> big<00:01:16.840> crack<00:01:17.170> here<00:01:17.500> kind<00:01:17.830> of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
and then this big crack here kind of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.920 
and then this big crack here kind of
goes<00:01:18.100> right<00:01:18.460> about<00:01:18.790> world<00:01:19.090> water<00:01:19.390> water<00:01:19.750> is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
goes right about world water water is

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.020
