still<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> record<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.800> both

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.540 
still the record for you know both
rounds<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.480> points<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.500> because<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
rounds and points also because all the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.139 
rounds and points also because all the
games<00:00:42.180> about<00:00:42.360> me<00:00:42.690> were<00:00:42.809> playing<00:00:43.290> co-op<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
games about me were playing co-op I

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.639 
games about me were playing co-op I
really<00:00:45.149> find<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> weird<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.469> only

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
really find it weird that there's only

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.650 
really find it weird that there's only
two<00:00:46.920> leaderboards<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.969> EXO<00:00:48.390> survival

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
two leaderboards for an EXO survival

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.139 
two leaderboards for an EXO survival
there's<00:00:49.320> only<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:50.100> career<00:00:50.370> total

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
there's only one for your career total

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.660 
there's only one for your career total
stats<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> match<00:00:52.680> stats<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
stats and one for the match stats and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
stats and one for the match stats and
now<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.210> any<00:00:57.660> separate

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
now there's not any separate

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.189 
now there's not any separate
leaderboards<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.460> separate

difficulties and the coop solo and
different<00:01:03.239> maps<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.870> mean<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.460> really<00:01:05.460> weird

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
different maps I mean it's really weird

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.080 
different maps I mean it's really weird
