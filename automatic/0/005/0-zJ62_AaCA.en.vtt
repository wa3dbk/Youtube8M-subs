 up to the time of the season of the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.100
 saints in his opinion was not like 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.479
 We wish we did not win any. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.400
 title this year 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.270
 the crowd of saints always accustomed 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.310
 with titles the people in this past year 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.780
 Blank but next year we will 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
 work hard ba 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.579
 to reach the final as we arrived 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.659
 in SÃ£o Paulo and arrives to win but this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.430
 The year we did a good job. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.149
 Claudinei also came out doing a good 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.939
 job 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.979
 it was above the expectation of all of them 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.770
 fulfilled that he had to make ahead 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.719
 of all Paulistas and is good inside. 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.070
 of your speech you try to claudinei 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.420
 ended up being wronged 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.340
 It's how you come highlighted made a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.799
 excellent campaign ahead of the big 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 of the capital and yet he did not 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.090
 remains to be said that it was 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.620
 unnecessary by the board of directors. 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.540
 is wronged 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.640
 I do not know why justice comes from 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.680
 God, I 'm not going to tell him 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.659
 was wronged I do not know that he made a 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.340
 Good job, is a guy who deserves a 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.610
 face that showed its value when it had the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.370
 opportunity and the board took this 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.670
 decision and we do not have that as a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.010
 interference but I always twisted 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.069
 he when he arrived i wanted him 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.000
 It would be well and welcome, now that he 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.250
 if it goes 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.360
 I want him to be very happy in the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.299
 his career is victorious here is you 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.329
 in 2009 debuted against the Fluminense and 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.769
 ended up leaving now and now lives a 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.390
 good moment with the shirt of the saints thinks 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 that this is the best time here your 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.299
 project to hold next year 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.060
 How do you see this is the moment? 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.190
 of the interruption is 2009 was a time 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.560
 difficult in which it was arriving enough 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.209
 Victory injury was adapting to the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.170
 city away from my family away from 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.819
 my family 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.549
 This moment for me is one of the moments 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.500
 happiest on and off the field is 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.359
 professionally I came to make a good 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 I always work whenever I come in 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.650
 seeking to do the best 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.329
 if you need there to play the starter I 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.560
 I want to sign up I want to work next 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.630

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.880
 player of the saints do history mark 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.190
 not only going here I'll pass but I

 I want to score winning titles here and abroad 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.370
 My country is wonderful too. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.090
 wife is pregnant is with four 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.650
 months 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.650
 so I'm living a dream moment 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.660
 alan is the money recently from a 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.780
 interview that we talking about 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.269
 planning and said that the plan 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.919
 from the saints to the new coach arrives 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.720
 regardless of which is 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.150
 work with a cast of 28 players 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.160
 today the saints have 36 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.010
 with the possible arrival of two three 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.709
 reinforcements and means an extra clean 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.599
 or less than 10 players in the cast and 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.250
 repercussions in some way and in 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.470
 people already know that it is common 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.569
 season is that the players do not 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 they like to have another list of 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.010
 if you have already heard anything 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.310
 that's how players have dealt with 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.010
 this is a group has always been a 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.050
 group all year this group one group 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.980
 champion who has already won titles 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.590
 behind titles 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.260
 who has no vanity and even who will not 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.970
 stay know he fulfilled as 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.640
 professionally play its role until the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.370
 end of contract without grumbling works 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.870
 works hard as in the case of the ford case 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.470
 in the function they are talking about that will not 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.740
 stay 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.910
 the renato abreu are experienced guys 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.390
 career victorious face 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.940
 professionally it has shown that the 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.790
 what they are doing is a role of 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.160
 a guy who is a winner 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.660
 alan oswaldo de oliveira one of the names 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.210
 quoted to take on the saints from 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.290
 next year but need botafogo 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.890
 theoretically do not reach the liberators 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.150
 anyway its good to dry the botafogo you 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.190
 think of oswaldo de oliveira as 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.510
 coach here for next year 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.340
 the guy does not find anybody, me or me 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.930
 I want people to be very happy, I 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.300
 I am a Christian I sought to prioritize 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.250
 to love your neighbor as yourself and 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.140
 go round olive tree stand on wine 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.420
 You are welcome to make a good 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.500
 I'm working here on the saints and I'm going to do the 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.330
 my job is also available 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.210
 for here the coach who saw the ball 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.240
 the position is large. 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.250
 but you're one of those guys so the 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.160
 immediate substitutes, for example 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.990
 has someone is injured or suspended you 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.570
 is one of the most quoted to assume a 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.700
 there are other positions that are not 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.770
 and so we take the attack 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.950
 example has nine players disputing 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.850
 two vacancies in this process of cleaning 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.080
 cast is supposed to happen some is some 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.390
 loans 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.000
 if you were a player who had not 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.340
 with this frequency entering the field and 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.170
 I offer you a loan for suddenly 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.850
 a smaller club but that you would have 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.260
 more opportunities to play 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.640
 how would you see this 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:24.610
 chance was like i said god 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.840
 open the door here for me and only he can 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.820
 close then thanks god comes come 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.710
 doing a good job and nobody spoke 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.260
 no loan if you had 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.230
 possibility to be the best for 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.520
 I was going to start with my wife to pray 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.720
 to see what God wanted because 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.790
 I gave my dream of mine 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.880
 life in God's hand then it is he who 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.340
 decide if he speaks bo smaller team I will 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.840
 do the same job there I will not judge 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.150
 because I've been through teams I do not know 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.370
 How difficult it is I 'm here in a team. 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.540
 great as the saints which is a showcase 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.880
 huge one of the biggest four of Brazil 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.370
 greater than the one in which the pellet 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.410
 King, so I 'm very happy in the team. 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.390
 big who pays on time a team that is 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.010
 always disputing title so I am 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.510
 very happy here and I do not think about this 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.850
 possibility because I already had the 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.070
 opportunity to borrow this year 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.060
 I still leave it in the hand of god, god, no 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.920
 wanted me to be 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.920
 so I'm here I'm at your disposal 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.180
 the real madrid b
