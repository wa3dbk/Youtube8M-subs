00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
has not been 100% proven however I've

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.359 
has not been 100% proven however I've
just<00:00:28.920> used<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.640> same<00:00:30.170> like<00:00:31.189> algorithm<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
just used the same like algorithm the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.479 
just used the same like algorithm the
same<00:00:32.610> methods<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.600> same<00:00:34.010> strategies<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.309> get

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
same methods the same strategies to get

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
same methods the same strategies to get
your<00:00:35.700> guns<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.090> neither<00:00:36.239> over<00:00:36.989> over<00:00:37.469> five

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
your guns or neither over over five

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.319 
your guns or neither over over five
accounts<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.489> worked<00:00:38.670> every<00:00:39.030> single

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
accounts and it's worked every single

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
accounts and it's worked every single
time<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:40.140> basically<00:00:40.500> saying<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
time so I'm basically saying this is a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.720 
time so I'm basically saying this is a
pretty<00:00:42.329> accurate<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:43.260> whether<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.370> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
pretty accurate way whether it was that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.330 
pretty accurate way whether it was that
I<00:00:44.910> told<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> stats<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> strategy

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
I told the stats right and the strategy

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
I told the stats right and the strategy
was<00:00:47.460> wrong<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:47.879> whether<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> strategy<00:00:48.809> was

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
was wrong or whether the strategy was

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
was wrong or whether the strategy was
right<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.039> actual<00:00:50.730> statistics<00:00:51.390> were

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
right and the actual statistics were

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.920 
right and the actual statistics were
wrong<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:52.050> basically<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.039> able<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
wrong I'm basically going to be able to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.360 
wrong I'm basically going to be able to
disclaim<00:00:54.930> everything<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.219> I'm

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
disclaim everything because if I'm

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
disclaim everything because if I'm
telling<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.390> shotguns<00:00:57.870> and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.300 
really gonna boost you guys I remember
when<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> was<00:03:28.200> trying<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.680> my<00:03:28.769> shotguns<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
when I was trying to get my shotguns I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.539 
when I was trying to get my shotguns I
literally<00:03:29.760> played<00:03:30.180> die<00:03:30.810> rise<00:03:31.459> 24-7<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
literally played die rise 24-7 the

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.250 
literally played die rise 24-7 the
silica<00:03:33.030> fire<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.600> was<00:03:33.720> running<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.110> bar

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
silica fire and I was running the bar

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.020 
silica fire and I was running the bar
strategy<00:03:34.829> which<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.070> actually<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.579> pretty<00:03:35.760> hard

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
strategy which is actually a pretty hard

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.259 
strategy which is actually a pretty hard
strategy<00:03:36.570> but<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.650> got<00:03:37.890> me<00:03:38.040> those<00:03:38.190> kills<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.730> was

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
strategy but it got me those kills I was

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.640 
strategy but it got me those kills I was
comfortable<00:03:39.510> with<00:03:39.840> doing<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.500> guys

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
comfortable with doing that if you guys

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.710 
comfortable with doing that if you guys
don't<00:03:40.980> feel<00:03:41.280> comfortable<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:42.329> doing<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
don't feel comfortable with doing a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.960 
don't feel comfortable with doing a
strategy<00:03:43.290> then<00:03:43.560> don't<00:03:43.860> do<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.880> know

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
strategy then don't do it you know

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.880 
strategy then don't do it you know
switch<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.420> up<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.630> if<00:03:45.900> if<00:03:46.079> you<00:03:46.320> can't<00:03:46.650> get

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
switch it up a bit if if you can't get

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.509 
switch it up a bit if if you can't get
those<00:03:47.070> high<00:03:47.310> rounds<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.860> it's

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
those high rounds and you know it's

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.090 
those high rounds and you know it's
basically<00:03:51.000> works<00:03:51.329> as<00:03:51.570> high<00:03:51.900> rounds<00:03:52.680> two<00:03:52.860> down

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
basically works as high rounds two down

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.680 
basically works as high rounds two down
so<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.459> doesn't<00:03:53.489> necessarily<00:03:54.239> mean<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.630> have

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
so it doesn't necessarily mean you have

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.860 
so it doesn't necessarily mean you have
to<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:54.989> round<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.579> 600<00:03:56.579> every<00:03:56.820> time<00:03:57.030> you

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
to get round like 600 every time you

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.199 
to get round like 600 every time you
basically<00:03:58.260> just<00:03:58.380> have<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:59.100> high<00:03:59.610> rounds

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
basically just have to have high rounds

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.910 
basically just have to have high rounds
to<00:04:00.450> less<00:04:00.630> down<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.170> if<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.530> don't<00:04:01.680> feel

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
to less down so if you don't feel

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.680 
to less down so if you don't feel
comfortable<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.209> spawn<00:04:03.480> rate

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
comfortable with like the spawn rate

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.259 
comfortable with like the spawn rate
after<00:04:03.900> 30<00:04:04.380> after<00:04:05.280> 30<00:04:05.519> rounds<00:04:05.910> if<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.120> guys

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
after 30 after 30 rounds if you guys

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.120 
after 30 after 30 rounds if you guys
want<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> end<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.870> that's<00:04:07.380> fine<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:07.980> want

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
want to end it that's fine if you want

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.920 
want to end it that's fine if you want
to<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.579> get<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.880> around<00:04:08.940> 30<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.630> end<00:04:09.780> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
to just get to around 30 and end the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.960 
to just get to around 30 and end the
game<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.860> completely<00:04:11.310> fine<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.850> you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
make sure it's an online so I not a

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.370 
make sure it's an online so I not a
local<00:05:10.740> game<00:05:11.100> either<00:05:12.230> obviously<00:05:13.230> you're<00:05:13.350> going

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
local game either obviously you're going

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.010 
local game either obviously you're going
to<00:05:13.560> need<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> five<00:05:14.040> tallies<00:05:14.490> which<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.940> course

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
to need the five tallies which of course

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.070 
to need the five tallies which of course
is<00:05:16.190> for<00:05:17.190> days<00:05:17.520> if<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:18.030> play<00:05:18.300> up<00:05:18.540> into<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.870> rank

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
is for days if you play up into a rank

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.810 
is for days if you play up into a rank
up<00:05:19.260> time<00:05:19.440> which<00:05:19.620> is<00:05:19.740> actually<00:05:19.919> one<00:05:20.340> am<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.730> the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
up time which is actually one am in the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.150 
up time which is actually one am in the
UK<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.540> depends<00:05:21.810> up<00:05:21.990> an<00:05:22.140> ear<00:05:22.290> up<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:22.950> late

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
UK so it depends up an ear up that late

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.100 
UK so it depends up an ear up that late
or<00:05:23.340> not<00:05:23.520> but<00:05:23.760> you<00:05:24.150> can<00:05:24.330> get<00:05:24.450> them<00:05:24.600> in<00:05:24.690> four<00:05:24.930> days

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
or not but you can get them in four days

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.490 
or not but you can get them in four days
so<00:05:25.410> you<00:05:25.890> will<00:05:26.460> need<00:05:26.910> five<00:05:27.330> tallies<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:28.290> get

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
so you will need five tallies to get

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.710 
so you will need five tallies to get
your<00:05:28.710> guns<00:05:28.950> people<00:05:29.550> said<00:05:29.820> no<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.270> don't<00:05:30.600> need

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
your guns people said no you don't need

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.800 
your guns people said no you don't need
five<00:05:30.990> tallies<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:32.490> once<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.090> have<00:05:33.390> five

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.900 
five tallies you once you have five
tallies<00:05:34.290> you<00:05:34.530> don't<00:05:34.800> need<00:05:34.979> them<00:05:35.160> again<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.790> get

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
tallies you don't need them again to get

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.090 
tallies you don't need them again to get
shotguns<00:05:36.450> but<00:05:36.720> if<00:05:36.900> you<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.200> never<00:05:37.440> had<00:05:37.800> five

shotguns but if you have never had five
tallies<00:05:38.550> before<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.270> will<00:05:39.540> need<00:05:39.870> them<00:05:40.080> to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
tallies before you will need them to
