00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.190
 once received 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.210
 May 65 x consumption 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.590
 no, because he has not been able to enter 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.550
 work 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 we turn it on 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 the first one that went on was put I'm 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.300
 in orange and it was the only time in which 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.940
 it worked we're going to use all the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.970
 buttons now as we see 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.059
 press the button you press 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 the screen does not change until the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.370
 telemobile actually drove that before 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.370
 I turned on the light does not turn on 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.320
 if I put it 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.320
 in the camera 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.070
 Well, it works but with a 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.900
 certain delay I'm going to put in focus the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 manual mode so you will not be 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.430
 focusing and if we see when shooting 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 we turn on the camera 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 and in a certain delay 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.510
 until it shoots instant sea 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.020
 but the flash is more 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.100
 until the shot is produced 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 it is not immediate 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.580
 we see and being in new ttl 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.580
 and it does not leave 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.850
 it will change the mode 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.539
 from time to time it is pressed from here they are 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.539
 these 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.649
 we turn it off we turn it on and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.770
 no way out in 24 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.770
 can not be modified 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.399
 it does not work
