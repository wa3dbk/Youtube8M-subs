it<00:00:15.309> does<00:00:15.459> go<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.000> just<00:00:16.180> slide<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:17.260> go<00:00:17.410> yeah

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
it does go and just slide the go yeah

in the slide you of a sudden you're in a

you're<00:01:12.770> coming<00:01:13.010> around<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:13.370> you<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.490> lot<00:01:13.670> up

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
you're coming around and you a lot up

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.970 
you're coming around and you a lot up
faster<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:14.660> you<00:01:14.720> required<00:01:15.230> two<00:01:15.410> counts<00:01:15.770> there

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
faster so you required two counts there

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.290 
faster so you required two counts there
and<00:01:16.340> then<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.520> front-wheel<00:01:16.760> drive<00:01:16.850> car<00:01:17.210> you

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
and then the front-wheel drive car you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.970 
and then the front-wheel drive car you
lookin<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.660> enter<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.290> corner<00:01:18.470> much<00:01:18.680> slower

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
the three uses a very realistic physics

the three uses a very realistic physics
model<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:56.030> aim<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.270> make<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.690> cars<00:01:56.990> as

realistic as possible we can grab

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.730 
realistic as possible we can grab
real-world<00:01:59.390> stats<00:01:59.750> from<00:02:00.290> there<00:02:00.440> we<00:02:00.590> can

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
real-world stats from there we can

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.859 
real-world stats from there we can
really<00:02:00.890> modify<00:02:01.520> an<00:02:01.820> alter<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.330> character

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
really modify an alter the character

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.719 
really modify an alter the character
around<00:02:03.110> those<00:02:03.320> figures

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
around those figures

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.600 
around those figures
it's<00:02:05.450> 400<00:02:05.930> parameters<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.619> go<00:02:07.250> forever

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
it's 400 parameters I can go forever

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.580 
it's 400 parameters I can go forever
just<00:02:07.789> tweaking<00:02:08.119> just<00:02:08.869> get<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.080> best<00:02:09.259> eyelet

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
just tweaking just get the best eyelet

setter mind-blowing is the first thing
that<00:02:11.450> comes<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.810> mind<00:02:12.019> them<00:02:12.260> how<00:02:12.739> realistic<00:02:13.280> it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
that comes to mind them how realistic it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.030 
that comes to mind them how realistic it
is<00:02:13.400> every<00:02:14.090> element<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:15.260> detail<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.769> went

is every element to the detail that went

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.190 
is every element to the detail that went
into<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.489> just<00:02:16.700> incredible<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.480> when<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.870> sit

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
into is just incredible and when I sit

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.229 
into is just incredible and when I sit
down<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:18.560> play<00:02:18.739> dirt<00:02:18.950> 3<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.489> get<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.910> sweat<00:02:20.209> on
