00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.860
 go hi everyone is gabriel 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.990
 or persimmon as you prefer and 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.090
 today we find ourselves on minecraft 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.029
 for a presentation of sid 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.490
 so this site is incident of the new 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.119
 survivors have only one daughter with one 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.850
 tree on it and some interesting stuff 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.059
 So that's what we're going to do 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.650
 enter the site here so I'll 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.830
 put I'm going to their file in addition 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.530
 big on the screen and we will generate our 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.580
 world 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.830
 that's sorry for the little while waiting 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.290
 but just for them 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.280
 to show you that it works well 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:04.129
 here's up have dropped spawn a little bit 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:08.780
 it's okay so here is so we 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:17.710
 is safe on the island is what are we going to do 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.710
 we will put ourselves in creative fashion here 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.710
 hop and we'll see that so we have an island 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 in the middle of the ocean nothing around nothing 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.380
 who knows that from the ocean and apart from this 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.790
 little island with a sugar cane on it 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.010
 so to make your table in change 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.990
 so in real big craze it's great 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.780
 to be well done for an adventure 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.180
 a survival adventure but it's not 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.540
 that because normally if I do not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.570
 not find below we had two 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 double crevice what is rather 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.570
 rather cool huh so by cons I'm 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 not sure exactly where these I am 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 remember more so i'm just going to do 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.030
 a small break we will go back and I 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.920
 showed you where to find it go 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.730
 So here it is again normally 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.770
 under the tree here so we're going gonna 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.980
 to dig but it's enough bages but 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.620
 I think so we'll dig quickly 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.160
 done and that's so we fall into this 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.350
 double crevasses so a crevasse there 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.070
 a crevasse there is frankly it's 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.380
 super cool ya it's a bit of an x 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:39.500
 look hot and there is a lot of stuff to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.709
 do on this side and it's in mode in 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.430
 bomb opinion the best survival site 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.790
 so he's surviving and that's it full 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.470
 some cool things to do on this side 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.910
 and so here it is displayed on the screen 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.860
 I do not say more I will not spoil 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.010
 your put our experience if you 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.720
 want to test this side and then on those 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.670
 I really hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.090

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.070
 videos like that of sid presentation 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.590
 and if you want more I 'll do it 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.870
 more simply 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.870
 so that's it if you're the cid 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:34.980

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:36.000
