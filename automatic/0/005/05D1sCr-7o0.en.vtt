00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.560
 firmly tv and with the company 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.210
 mail.ru I present to you a review on t-34 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
 on tank legend 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.969
 To be honest, tankers do not really 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.539
 stands out from the fifth levels but it 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.750
 his and handsome so kv-1 is thick 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.490
 armor yes it's nice but let's say 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 the m10 has a good gun 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 and here everything is in moderation and it's just 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 great i mean t-34 is the most 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 medium medium tanks that can 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.000
 meet and it is impossible to say 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 all this mean poured into something 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.320
 inexpressive gray and uninteresting as 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 once again, on the contrary, all characteristics 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 on the contrary, they give a sum of very 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.340
 interesting car and now you will see 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 fights where this car is 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.879
 Well, not so much that manifests itself but in every 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.160
 case is quite capable she keep herself 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.070
 some kind of damage stuff somehow 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.469
 show yourself even in a battle with sixes 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 there is a gun here 76 millimeters two 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.110
 tools to choose from there 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 aggregate 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.299
 probably still it is better to put 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 gun 57 mm since she 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.260
 more precisely, and bears less 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.689
 single damage but 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 he has higher accuracy and recharge 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.700
 him much faster but of course in 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.659
 this configuration you can find 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 thirty four 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 video on it is more accurate on my channel 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.549
 and in this video weâ€™ll talk about 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 given and so let's say a variant and 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.939
 consider all its benefits and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.570
 imperfections as you see the weapon very 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.119
 slanting 46 information and the circle itself 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.759
 not small but it does not interfere 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.220
 us shoot from some ambushes and 34-ka 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.659
 it's quite capable of recharging five 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.570
 and a half seconds not to say that a lot 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.570
 do not say so little and in this 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.729
 still video machine without modules only with 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.409
 crew of 12 levels of modules 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.930
 It is recommended, of course, to set 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.119
 rammer and also necessarily 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.500
 set drives information and stabilizers 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.780
 in order to scatter somehow 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.060
 to compensate 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.080
 guns, in principle, not bad 109 here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.120
 breaking through at quite a level 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.280
 unfortunately siphons on 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.540
 given gun breaking through a total of 120 they 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.960
 here are useless but here on 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.300
 57-mm guns they carry themselves already 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.880
 under 200 millimeters penetration and there 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.970
 there is where to go one-time damage with us 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.160
 about 200 units less about 180 if 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.140
 to be exact and that's basically nice for 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.070
 such a rate of fire though of course 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.700
 far from a record 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.970
 but it is still a good instrument 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.670
 and allows you to play comfortably against 5 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.440
 the levels are certainly the sixth of course 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.020
 there is some morocco but axial 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.970
 it is understandable to fight quite difficult but 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.070
 for this we have something else we have 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.650
 have great speed and dynamics 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.810
 the car picks up its speed cheerfully and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.450
 keeps it pretty good build capable 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.750
 develop right up to 60 kilometers per hour i 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.000
 I remember once and 70 gained well and so 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.550
 on a flat surface 40 kilometers without 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.090
 without any problems 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.550
 effort and spitting motors rides on the very 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.920
 really fast and turns too fast 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.900
 and this is convenient because you can twist 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.360
 some heavy tanks quickly change 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.160
 position that the main thing on medium tanks 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.650
 shoot out like a sniper several times 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.660
 from one place and continued to be confused 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.630
 the enemy is shooting from another place 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.730
 when he is there to see you does not even expect 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.500
 but in this fight, unfortunately it is not me 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.090
 showed only show about how you can 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.100
 shoot a given gun that she is quite 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.410
 able to deal damage and already several 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.250
 opponents got from me since i'm in 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.530
 the very beginning of the battle is also very good 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.930
 Dunka caught me in general that is 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.810
 of course not worth well, of course 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.090
 t-34 is not a breakthrough tank is still a tank 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.970
 support more in our game their battles 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.769
 high level ie 6 and 7 he is not 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.230
 able to tank due to the fact that armor 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.080
 we have a maximum of 45 millimeters 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.260
 sloping frontal sloping let 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.330
 and equivalent to 90 millimeters straight 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.830
 armor but still not enough 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.610
 to withstand shells somehow 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.470
 serious guns even 4 5 level is quite 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.180
 able to punch thirty four not 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.640
 mention and that the sixth and seventh 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.190
 they can blame you for disgrace and killers 1 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.830
 a shot but it certainly happens very much and 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.130
 very rarely of can we assume 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.110
 leave just the number of hit points 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.539
 if you blow your side then you 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.430
 die so with big levels 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.560
 play should not gently stick out 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.020
 once again and think a head of course 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.479
 since you have a good principle 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.130
 cannon and good speed then you can 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.590
 think up how to use it all 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.410
 go around the enemy to occupy the unexpected 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.750
 positions from there nastrelivat but of course 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.720
 the same choice of tools is yours or 50 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.460
 families millimeter or 76 in principle 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.800
 probably still worth recommending 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.349
 57 millimeter cannon as it is more 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.860
 accurate and rapid though although not so 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.539
 home with a single shot but probably in 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.430
 this does not cover any absolutely 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.050
 problems so choose the layout 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.789
 This tank for themselves and of course 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.919
 I recommend you keep it in your 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.410
 hangar as this machine is also capable 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.810
 stuff you in silver why not 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.490
 since you can and you had a circle tv 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.669
 together with mail.ru 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.090
 see you soon and bye for now 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.090
 in fights
