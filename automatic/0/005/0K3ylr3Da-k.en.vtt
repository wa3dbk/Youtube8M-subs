00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello friends let's today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.140
 Consider one very interesting device 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.870
 Of course he will be in one of us 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.330
 rockin 'of a movie releases but today 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.690
 I would like to consider a number of features 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 which I usually don't talk about 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.279
 knees rectifier 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.470
 regarding straight if you ever 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.930
 want to buy a similar device you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 you will certainly look for information about him 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 on the internet and will surely find 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.510
 many negative reviews let's 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.989
 We will understand why this happens this 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 the device was developed in the 90s 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 there is no say even in the late 80s 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.030
 it was he made in the 90s and then 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.610
 engineers or marketers felt 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.620
 good idea title add word 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.160
 recore link to emphasize that he 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.989
 made specifically for recording 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.449
 let's connect it to the sound now 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.859
 card using a special outlet for 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.859
 write and listen 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.310
 maybe in the 90s it sounded 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.670
 decently but now when it's 2014 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340
 year 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.259
 it just sounds like shit and here we are 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.119
 we get this situation people see 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.820
 words record ng buys him for 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.100
 Record nga and it costs incidentally 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.730
 very decent and in the end the mass 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.100
 disappointments but we are the people who know 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.620
 and we understand what you need to score on the old 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.900
 emulate and use pulses on 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.700
 let's computer again now 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.410
 connected to sound card 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.600
 but this time we will use 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 normal output and on the computer will 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.160
 use momentum 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.160
 cabinet 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.290
 quite another thing with this here 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.060
 interesting system if you increase 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.079
 channel volume then the sound will be too 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.079
 change let's listen 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.520
 so we get the sound 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.950
 of the present rectifier, and yet 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.720
 be sure to kill the neighbors and still in 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.850
 on the Internet they say that he is mumbling very much 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.400
 at low frequencies and he has problems with 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.040
 readability and it really is and 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 it happens because of it because of want 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.890
 electro-harmonix 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.710
 if you try to put the data 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.169
 Lamps are tested on two devices 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.910
 readability problems begin 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:40.350
 bubnezh begins farting low 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.180
 frequencies and places even floats game then 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.150
 there is this lamp very badly on it 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.280
 go he uses 6 lamps 2 of which 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.160
 used for effects pedals 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.140
 here on the loop you can save the rest 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.330
 four lamps best to put 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.080
 vile now let's see how 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.610
 You can improve the sound in the mix because 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.210
 the sound is quite bold and not always 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.850
 well he goes to the mix at the devices 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.919
 meat is very interesting working equalizer 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.380
 so if some frequency will be 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.690
 dominate the other parameters already 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.210
 will not so much affect so if 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.130
 You want the texture to be so fat but 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.540
 at the same time it is bad in the mix 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.600
 then you need to use this thing 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.180
 overdrive in this case is mxr custom 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.760
 bada smadi fight over drive 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.540
 By the way, we are our favorites lately 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.460
 Well, I can find a video where I have it. 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.530
 doing what 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.740
 I reduce gain somewhere so here until the middle 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.870
 maybe a little smaller and used such 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.380
 Here are the settings, then it's in the middle 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.280
 on all 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.390
 and a little gain and here's this parameter 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.710
 low cut 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.290
 here he is in neutral 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.290
 position let's listen 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.540
 but 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.540
 but 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.740
 thank you very much for seeing with you 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.309
 was Alexei Zabrodin I hope I managed 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.110
 Today 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:41.689
 dispel some doubts about regards 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.759
 This unit is a good decent device 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.339
 but unfortunately very little information about 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.650
 it especially objective information is not 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:51.680
 forget to subscribe soon we are listening 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:57.969
 this pedal is also an interesting place 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.969
 pedal well peculiar goodbye
