00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
right now I am going to complete this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.999 
right now I am going to complete this
transfer<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.119> fabric<00:00:19.070> like<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.220> see<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
transfer on fabric like you see here and

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.460 
transfer on fabric like you see here and
on<00:00:23.009> this<00:00:23.430> little<00:00:23.789> pennant<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.779> put<00:00:25.079> some

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
on this little pennant I have put some

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.639 
on this little pennant I have put some
things<00:00:25.680> from<00:00:26.099> our<00:00:26.279> September<00:00:27.320> dreaming<00:00:28.320> kit

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
things from our September dreaming kit

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.209 
things from our September dreaming kit
and<00:00:29.090> I'm<00:00:30.090> testing<00:00:30.719> different<00:00:30.960> transfer<00:00:31.919> media

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and I'm testing different transfer media

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.260 
and I'm testing different transfer media
right<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:35.039> with<00:00:35.250> matte<00:00:35.969> medium

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
right now so this was with matte medium

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
right now so this was with matte medium
this<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.260> fabric<00:00:37.800> medium<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:40.320> one

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this was with fabric medium and this one

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.819 
this was with fabric medium and this one
was<00:00:40.860> done<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:42.600> favorite<00:00:43.230> medium<00:00:43.620> which

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
was done with my favorite medium which

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.180 
was done with my favorite medium which
is<00:00:43.860> actually<00:00:44.520> Mod<00:00:44.880> Podge<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.780> paper<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.410> think

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is actually Mod Podge for paper I think

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
is actually Mod Podge for paper I think
it<00:00:47.310> works<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> best<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.290> most<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.470> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it works the best out of most of the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.190 
it works the best out of most of the
transfer<00:00:50.040> mediums<00:00:50.399> its<00:00:51.090> second<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> plain<00:00:52.170> old

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
transfer mediums its second to plain old

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.030 
transfer mediums its second to plain old
Elmer's<00:00:52.860> glue<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.010> just

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
Elmer's glue so this is one that I just

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.030 
Elmer's glue so this is one that I just
did<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:56.910> still<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.360> wet<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.500> did

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
did so it's still a little wet and I did

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.799 
did so it's still a little wet and I did
this<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.430> recently<00:00:59.970> I'm<00:01:00.090> gonna<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.450> this<00:01:00.600> one

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this one recently I'm gonna do this one

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.479 
this one recently I'm gonna do this one
right<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> show<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.130> easy<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
right now just to show you how easy it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.709 
right now just to show you how easy it
is<00:01:02.640> using<00:01:03.600> magic<00:01:04.019> transfer<00:01:04.710> paper<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
is using magic transfer paper which is a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.630 
is using magic transfer paper which is a
cellulose<00:01:06.719> fiber<00:01:07.140> paper<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.799> dissolves<00:01:08.340> way

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
cellulose fiber paper that dissolves way

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.090 
cellulose fiber paper that dissolves way
more<00:01:09.270> easily<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.899> any<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.380> transfer

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
more easily than any other transfer

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.440 
more easily than any other transfer
method<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.000> paper<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.259> using<00:01:13.469> a

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
method in paper so I'm just using a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
method in paper so I'm just using a
moderately<00:01:15.450> stiff<00:01:15.869> brush<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:17.179> this<00:01:18.179> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
moderately stiff brush this is a this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.609 
moderately stiff brush this is a this is
actually<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.810> Martha<00:01:19.289> Stewart<00:01:19.759> I'll<00:01:20.759> show<00:01:20.999> ya<00:01:21.209> a

actually a Martha Stewart I'll show ya a
Martha<00:01:22.619> Stewart<00:01:22.979> brand<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.549> came<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.999> in<00:01:24.149> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
Martha Stewart brand that came like in a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.199 
Martha Stewart brand that came like in a
little<00:01:24.450> 3-pack<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.819> brush

little 3-pack and I'm going to brush

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.580 
little 3-pack and I'm going to brush
some<00:01:28.729> plain<00:01:29.729> old<00:01:29.759> water<00:01:30.209> onto<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
some plain old water onto the back of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.709 
some plain old water onto the back of
the<00:01:31.829> paper<00:01:32.069> that's<00:01:32.399> transferred<00:01:33.060> onto<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
the paper that's transferred onto the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.980 
the paper that's transferred onto the
fabric<00:01:34.259> which<00:01:34.499> is<00:01:34.679> just<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> raw<00:01:35.249> canvas

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
fabric which is just a raw canvas

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
fabric which is just a raw canvas
pennant<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.529> at<00:01:37.859> Hobby<00:01:38.159> Lobby<00:01:38.389> and<00:01:40.490> as

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
pennant that I got at Hobby Lobby and as

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.949 
pennant that I got at Hobby Lobby and as
the<00:01:42.299> paper<00:01:42.539> gets<00:01:42.840> wet<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.409> saturated<00:01:44.959> the

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
the paper gets wet and saturated the

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.199 
the paper gets wet and saturated the
cellulose<00:01:46.560> fiber<00:01:46.979> starts<00:01:47.549> breaking<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.619> and

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
cellulose fiber starts breaking down and

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.319 
cellulose fiber starts breaking down and
you<00:01:51.209> can<00:01:51.359> see<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.039> mush<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.700> hand<00:01:53.969> along

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you can see if I just mush my hand along

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.940 
you can see if I just mush my hand along
it<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.719> coming<00:01:55.229> right<00:01:55.349> off<00:01:56.329> that's<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
it it's coming right off that's the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.129 
it it's coming right off that's the
that's<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.099> fibers<00:01:59.579> right<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.359> that

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
that's the fibers right there that

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.349 
that's the fibers right there that
usually<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.950> would<00:02:02.069> have<00:02:02.099> to<00:02:02.399> spend<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
usually you would have to spend like a

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.719 
usually you would have to spend like a
long<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:06.169> trying<00:02:07.169> to<00:02:07.319> get<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> paper<00:02:08.429> off

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
long time trying to get the paper off

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.010 
long time trying to get the paper off
the<00:02:08.759> back<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.209> your<00:02:09.450> image

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.630 

so<00:02:14.630> there<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.200> pretty<00:02:16.590> much<00:02:16.770> done<00:02:17.130> in

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
so there it is it's pretty much done in

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.020 
so there it is it's pretty much done in
like<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.210> few<00:02:18.720> seconds<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:20.520> because<00:02:20.820> I've

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
like a few seconds I know because I've

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.100 
like a few seconds I know because I've
tried<00:02:21.240> doing<00:02:21.480> image<00:02:21.870> transfers<00:02:22.470> before<00:02:22.740> with

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
tried doing image transfers before with

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
tried doing image transfers before with
regular<00:02:25.110> paper<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.100> takes<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.600> takes

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
regular paper and it takes like it takes

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.350 
regular paper and it takes like it takes
an<00:02:28.050> impossible<00:02:28.770> amount<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.460> time<00:02:29.700> sitting

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
an impossible amount of time sitting

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.030 
an impossible amount of time sitting
there<00:02:30.510> trying<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.960> peel<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.620> back<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
there trying to peel the back of the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.390 
there trying to peel the back of the
paper<00:02:32.250> off<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.940> image<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.500> magic<00:02:34.980> transfer

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
paper off of the image so magic transfer

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.480 
paper off of the image so magic transfer
paper<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.320> easy<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.890> use<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.460> just

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
paper is really easy to use you just

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.400 
paper is really easy to use you just
have<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.000> print<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.360> with<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> laser<00:02:39.900> printer

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
have to print it with a laser printer

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.820 
have to print it with a laser printer
because<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:43.440> paper<00:02:43.650> is

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
because as you can see the paper is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.440 
because as you can see the paper is
disintegrating<00:02:44.750> with<00:02:46.010> water<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.310> an<00:02:48.090> inkjet

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450

the<00:02:54.120> paper<00:02:54.530> using<00:02:55.530> liquid<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.570> tried

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the paper using liquid so if you tried

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.450 
the paper using liquid so if you tried
to<00:02:57.840> put<00:02:57.960> this<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.380> an<00:02:58.530> inkjet<00:02:58.740> printer<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
to put this in an inkjet printer you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.700 
to put this in an inkjet printer you
will<00:02:59.690> completely<00:03:00.690> gum<00:03:01.110> up<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.530> whole

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
will completely gum up the whole

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.620 
will completely gum up the whole
interior<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.640> printer<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.180> make<00:03:03.360> sure<00:03:03.390> you

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
interior of the printer so make sure you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.840 
interior of the printer so make sure you
don't<00:03:03.750> make<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.170> mistake<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:05.250> has<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.640> go<00:03:05.730> in

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
don't make that mistake it has to go in

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.930 
don't make that mistake it has to go in
a<00:03:05.940> laser<00:03:06.150> printer<00:03:06.920> but<00:03:07.920> there<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.400> look<00:03:08.790> at
