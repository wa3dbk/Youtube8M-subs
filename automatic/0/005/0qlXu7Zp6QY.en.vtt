 how about friends greet you again 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 jorge mendoza in this second part of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.910
 the exercises to vocalize your 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.850
 guitar on this occasion I want to propose 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.640
 a simple exercise so you can 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.640
 improve the treble timely to achieve 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.270
 this way if you remember the video 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.670
 previous is very similar to perhaps the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 greater has sustained and traveling the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.100
 frets 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 higher 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.830
 boom bum boom dad tries that all the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 notes that you are making are only brief 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.000
 for that consonant for that for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.490
 importing should also be a little bit 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.860
 be a bit aggressive also a 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.870
 bit 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.870
 this 90 years pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:28.300
 taking care of the tuning obviously and to 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.300
 last you can extend your hand 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.899
 we advance 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.099
 ok this peace must be short because that's the way it is 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.210
 the characteristic of this constant and you 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.490
 will serve to make your flowers 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.270
 and access a little more control a 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.860
 little bit more those those treble 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:35.880
 try to do it bluntly 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:40.110
 not not doing it legato is to say when 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.520
 the allegation is more inclusive be more 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.390
 country country country country country 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.900
 more highlights and short notes and 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.900
 accented 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.870
 for dad 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.560
 ok that's a very simple way of 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.530
 do it if you need to return the video 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.290
 do it as many times as necessary 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.110
 I invite you to check 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.660
 carefully the exercises if still 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.150
 this exercise does not come back to the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.920
 previous part and repeat the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.170
