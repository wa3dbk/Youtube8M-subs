00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
those calipers were was a little bit of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.399 
those calipers were was a little bit of
a<00:01:52.710> challenge<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.520> how<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:55.200> line

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
a challenge you can see how the the line

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.520 
a challenge you can see how the the line
comes<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> bottom<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.530> is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
comes in from the bottom and that is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.789 
comes in from the bottom and that is
because<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.479> mercedes<00:02:00.479> c<00:02:00.750> 32<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.380> calipers

are modded ahead of the spindle but on a
190<00:02:05.909> either<00:02:06.270> mounted<00:02:06.600> behind<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.290> had<00:02:07.439> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
190 either mounted behind so you had to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
190 either mounted behind so you had to
take<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.920> set<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.580> calipers<00:02:08.879> disassemble

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
take the set of calipers disassemble

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.590 
take the set of calipers disassemble
them<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.400> mix<00:02:11.400> parts<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.150> put<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.390> back

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
them and mix parts and then put it back

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.960

together<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.370> that's<00:02:14.610> what<00:02:14.850> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
together and and then that's what you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
together and and then that's what you
get<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.650> fit<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.280> a

then also bar underneath the front of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.230 
then also bar underneath the front of
the<00:02:29.070> car<00:02:29.250> right<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:32.240> air

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the car right here is one of the the air

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.570 
the car right here is one of the the air
to<00:02:33.480> water<00:02:33.600> heat<00:02:34.080> exchangers<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:35.460> the

to water heat exchangers for the
intercooler<00:02:36.060> system<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:37.010> intercooler

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
intercooler system so that intercooler

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.880 
intercooler system so that intercooler
in<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.640> intake<00:02:39.270> manifold<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.440> routes<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
in the intake manifold it routes the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.890 
in the intake manifold it routes the
water<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.940> there's<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.480> radiator

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
water down here and there's a radiator

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.060 
water down here and there's a radiator
here<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> 10<00:02:44.790> inch<00:02:44.970> fan<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.920> then<00:02:46.920> he's

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
here with a 10 inch fan and then he's

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.740 
here with a 10 inch fan and then he's
got<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> thermostat<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.850> kicks<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.600> will

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
got a thermostat that kicks in and will

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.290 
got a thermostat that kicks in and will
control<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.800> cool<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.300> coolant

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
control that and cool the coolant

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.390 
control that and cool the coolant
temperature<00:02:51.570> down<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> intake<00:02:52.920> manifold

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
temperature down for the intake manifold

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.830 
temperature down for the intake manifold
so<00:02:53.580> there's<00:02:53.760> one<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.000> these<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.420> left<00:02:54.630> side

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
so there's one of these on the left side

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.600 
so there's one of these on the left side
and<00:02:55.940> one<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.210> right<00:02:57.390> side<00:02:58.010> I'm<00:02:59.010> not<00:02:59.250> quite

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
and one on the right side I'm not quite

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.400 
and one on the right side I'm not quite
sure<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.970> kind<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.300> vehicle<00:03:00.690> he<00:03:00.870> scavenged

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
sure what kind of a vehicle he scavenged

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.590 
sure what kind of a vehicle he scavenged
those<00:03:01.620> from<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.280> he's<00:03:02.790> fitted<00:03:03.150> them<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.420> there

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
those from but he's fitted them in there

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.360 
those from but he's fitted them in there
and<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.200> pretty<00:03:04.770> nice<00:03:04.950> piece<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.220> work

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and that's a pretty nice piece of work

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.630 
and that's a pretty nice piece of work
there<00:03:05.670> I'll<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.120> doesn't<00:03:07.490> distract<00:03:08.490> from

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
there I'll say it doesn't distract from

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.100 
there I'll say it doesn't distract from
the<00:03:08.820> appearance<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.390> car<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.750> don't<00:03:09.870> have

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
the appearance of the car you don't have

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.950 
the appearance of the car you don't have
any<00:03:10.290> big<00:03:11.100> Vulgar<00:03:11.420> intercooler<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> front

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
any big Vulgar intercooler in the front

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.090 
any big Vulgar intercooler in the front
like<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.380> often<00:03:13.710> see<00:03:13.860> with<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
like you just often see with a

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.450 
like you just often see with a
turbocharger<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:15.810> nice<00:03:16.020> tidy

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
turbocharger is a very nice tidy

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.550 
turbocharger is a very nice tidy
installation<00:03:17.460> that<00:03:17.610> he's<00:03:17.730> made<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:19.140> so

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
installation that he's made and so

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.740 
installation that he's made and so
that's<00:03:19.890> about<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.550> underneath<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that's about it underneath the the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.690 
that's about it underneath the the
bottom<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.200> car<00:03:22.380> here<00:03:22.710> you<00:03:23.520> won't<00:03:23.640> see

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
bottom of the car here you won't see

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.820 
bottom of the car here you won't see
anything<00:03:23.970> else<00:03:24.210> except<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.200> piece<00:03:25.470> which<00:03:25.710> is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
anything else except this piece which is

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.820 
anything else except this piece which is
a<00:03:25.860> little<00:03:26.190> bit<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.460> mystery<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.000> me<00:03:27.150> but

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
a little bit of a mystery to me but

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.950 
a little bit of a mystery to me but
that's<00:03:28.830> what<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> get<00:03:29.340> sometimes<00:03:29.400> when<00:03:30.120> when

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
that's what you get sometimes when when

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.140 
that's what you get sometimes when when
somebody<00:03:31.560> passes<00:03:31.770> away<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.400> still<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.820> work<00:03:33.030> in

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
somebody passes away and still a work in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.510 
somebody passes away and still a work in
progress<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.870> that's<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.280> front<00:03:35.460> of

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
progress so that's it for the front of

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.370 
progress so that's it for the front of
the<00:03:35.610> car<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.090> then<00:03:36.660> in<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.810> next<00:03:36.900> video<00:03:37.200> we'll

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
the car and then in the next video we'll

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.470 
the car and then in the next video we'll
take<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> look<00:03:37.740> at<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.180> at<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.240> rear

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
take a look at the at the rear

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.050 
take a look at the at the rear
suspension
