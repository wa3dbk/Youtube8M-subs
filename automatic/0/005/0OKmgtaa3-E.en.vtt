00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
the time anyway right that's exactly

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.030 
the time anyway right that's exactly
right<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:17.720> III<00:02:18.410> try<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.010> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
right and I think III try to get a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.650 
right and I think III try to get a
little<00:02:19.280> bit<00:02:19.430> away<00:02:19.610> from<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.030> down<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.390> nothing

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
little bit away from the down to nothing

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.090 
little bit away from the down to nothing
because<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.230> inclusion<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.920> is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
because really inclusion is is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.130 
because really inclusion is is
understanding<00:02:22.550> everybody<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.990> one

understanding everybody and and the one
thing<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.440> forget<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.070> when<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:25.400> talk<00:02:25.550> about

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
thing we forget is it when we talk about

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.980 
thing we forget is it when we talk about
inclusive<00:02:26.000> education<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.630> think<00:02:26.780> we're<00:02:26.900> doing

from a very young age grow up to be
better<00:02:39.260> people<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.830> think<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.430> more<00:02:40.610> we

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640

do separate children based on on maybe

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.170 
do separate children based on on maybe
you<00:03:38.870> know<00:03:38.960> their<00:03:39.380> first<00:03:39.590> language<00:03:40.040> or<00:03:40.310> you

you know their first language or you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.500 
you know their first language or you
know<00:03:41.270> whatever<00:03:41.840> their<00:03:42.110> learning<00:03:42.410> ability<00:03:42.830> is

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
know whatever their learning ability is

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.050 
know whatever their learning ability is
is<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.780> ever<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.200> good<00:03:45.440> idea<00:03:45.830> in<00:03:45.920> your<00:03:46.040> mind<00:03:46.100> to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
is that ever a good idea in your mind to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.180 
is that ever a good idea in your mind to
separate<00:03:47.630> case<00:03:47.810> yeah<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.380> think<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.860> all<00:03:48.890> have

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
separate case yeah I think we all have

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.520 
separate case yeah I think we all have
that<00:03:49.220> fear<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.300> our<00:03:50.660> kids<00:03:50.900> being<00:03:51.110> able<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.350> keep

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
that fear of our kids being able to keep

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.100 
that fear of our kids being able to keep
up<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.120> there<00:03:53.510> are<00:03:53.540> times<00:03:53.780> and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
up and and and and there are times and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.050 
up and and and and there are times and
we<00:03:54.200> wonder<00:03:54.740> our<00:03:54.860> for<00:03:55.070> ourselves<00:03:55.550> and<00:03:55.880> as

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
we wonder our for ourselves and as

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.850 
we wonder our for ourselves and as
parents<00:03:56.450> we<00:03:56.600> have<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.750> make<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.050> decision<00:03:57.470> not

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
parents we have to make the decision not

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.530 
parents we have to make the decision not
well<00:03:58.070> maybe<00:03:58.550> we<00:03:58.790> think<00:03:58.970> it's<00:03:59.150> best<00:03:59.300> for<00:03:59.390> our

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
well maybe we think it's best for our

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.180 
well maybe we think it's best for our
kids<00:03:59.660> but<00:03:59.900> what<00:04:00.110> really<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.710> best<00:04:00.980> for<00:04:01.100> our

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
kids but what really is best for our

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.130 
kids but what really is best for our
kids<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:02.210> think<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.480> most<00:04:02.660> important

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
kids and I think the most important

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.660 
kids and I think the most important
factor<00:04:03.470> when<00:04:03.530> you're<00:04:03.650> looking<00:04:03.860> at<00:04:04.040> school<00:04:04.310> is

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
factor when you're looking at school is

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.220 
factor when you're looking at school is
the<00:04:04.910> principals<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.600> teachers<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:06.110> mean

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
the principals and the teachers I mean

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.720 
the principals and the teachers I mean
irregardless<00:04:06.740> of<00:04:06.980> what<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.190> school<00:04:07.400> system

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
irregardless of what the school system

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.980 
irregardless of what the school system
is<00:04:07.850> if<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.060> have<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.210> good<00:04:08.360> principal<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:08.900> good

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
is if you have a good principal and good

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.960 
is if you have a good principal and good
teacher<00:04:09.200> things<00:04:09.590> work<00:04:09.770> out<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:10.610> think<00:04:10.700> the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
teacher things work out but I think the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.790 
teacher things work out but I think the
benefits<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.510> inclusion<00:04:11.810> go<00:04:12.050> far<00:04:12.350> beyond<00:04:12.650> the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
benefits of inclusion go far beyond the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.260 
benefits of inclusion go far beyond the
classroom<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.640> that's<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.030> message

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
classroom and I think that's the message

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.690 
classroom and I think that's the message
here<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:14.810> inclusion<00:04:15.590> isn't<00:04:15.770> an<00:04:16.040> all-or-none

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
here and inclusion isn't an all-or-none

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.979 
here and inclusion isn't an all-or-none
thing<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.180> mean<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.359> think<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.720> more<00:04:17.960> you

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
thing I mean I think the more you

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.360 
thing I mean I think the more you
include<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.560> kids<00:04:18.710> the<00:04:18.950> more<00:04:19.160> everybody

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
include the kids the more everybody

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.580 
include the kids the more everybody
benefits<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.150> think<00:04:20.330> that<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.840> benefit<00:04:21.290> for

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
benefits I think that the benefit for

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.520 
benefits I think that the benefit for
dev<00:04:22.240> for<00:04:23.240> truly<00:04:23.450> notices<00:04:23.900> she<00:04:24.050> has<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.410> have

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
dev for truly notices she has to have

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.290 
dev for truly notices she has to have
her<00:04:24.590> she<00:04:24.890> has<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.040> great<00:04:25.460> time<00:04:25.790> she<00:04:26.000> has

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
her she has a great time she has

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.240 
her she has a great time she has
the<00:04:26.810> benefit<00:04:27.319> for<00:04:27.470> only<00:04:27.620> other<00:04:27.919> cheerleaders

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the benefit for only other cheerleaders

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.760 
the benefit for only other cheerleaders
is<00:04:28.669> they<00:04:28.970> get<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.300> sort<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.629> you<00:04:30.110> know<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.440> best

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
is they get to sort of you know the best

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.619 
is they get to sort of you know the best
technology<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.280> can<00:04:31.490> think<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.849> is<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.599> know

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
technology I can think of is you know

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.029 
technology I can think of is you know
when<00:04:32.900> they<00:04:32.990> were<00:04:33.050> doing<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.379> round<00:04:33.560> table

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
when they were doing the round table

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.850 
when they were doing the round table
with<00:04:34.669> all<00:04:34.819> the<00:04:34.849> cheerleaders<00:04:35.560> they<00:04:36.560> all<00:04:36.680> had

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
with all the cheerleaders they all had

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.200 
with all the cheerleaders they all had
their<00:04:37.069> their<00:04:37.220> beefs<00:04:37.520> about<00:04:37.759> what<00:04:37.909> was<00:04:38.030> going

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
their their beefs about what was going

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.240
