00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.159
 included in this part 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.659
 and take you to the sea 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.630
 this is widening because it is always alive 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 and in fact rights in this way 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.449
 ok so it's based on what I call myself abruptly and why 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.449
 in the middle of this pentatonic scale 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.380
 lot and go molveno the lookout hello because the phrase nice 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.630
 ni 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630
 ebay 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.310
 never 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.310
 damon 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.070
 I put prostitution on one side I was born of a guitarist who 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.080
 so many times ago so long ago many years ago we saw it also as a lesson 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.030
 then I want to show you week when I'm on some people 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 in certain contexts hotels in this particular 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.750
 these rumors 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.090
 from a person really 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.730
 that's all now 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.700
 I think you still play with dip parpol in a context where it is that it is no longer 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.900
 what mind of the past 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 however he was definitely a great one and is definitely a great one 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 Your way of interpreting has certainly been new 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.490
 cost 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.620
 these the mismo places these sounds 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.990
 in the 70's 80's another one he made a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.920
 let's say they don't use this sound point of view 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.410
 along with their way as fuck to san marino 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.290
 for which 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.420
 let's say that on this type of impact both can be 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 equated even if you obviously go 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
 hahaha 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.149

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:02.679
 to 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.679
