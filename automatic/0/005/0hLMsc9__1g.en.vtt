00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
understand this procedure is usually

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.710 
understand this procedure is usually
fairly<00:02:04.170> straightforward<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.720> people

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
fairly straightforward and people

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.010 
fairly straightforward and people
usually<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.310> very<00:02:08.520> good<00:02:08.820> results<00:02:09.360> the

usually get very very good results the
procedure<00:02:10.440> itself<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.040> deceptively<00:02:11.700> simple

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
procedure itself is deceptively simple

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.380 
procedure itself is deceptively simple
and<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> result<00:02:13.920> people<00:02:14.010> make<00:02:14.490> mistakes

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and as a result people make mistakes

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.320 
and as a result people make mistakes
not<00:02:16.380> because<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.400> they<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.610> things<00:02:18.000> wrong

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
not because that they do things wrong

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.230 
not because that they do things wrong
but<00:02:18.660> they're<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> little<00:02:19.350> bit<00:02:19.620> careless<00:02:20.240> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
but they're a little bit careless the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.800 
but they're a little bit careless the
main<00:02:21.480> thing<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.050> be<00:02:22.260> very<00:02:22.590> careful<00:02:23.190> in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
main thing is to be very careful in

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.480 
main thing is to be very careful in
recording<00:02:24.810> your<00:02:24.959> length<00:02:25.170> accurately<00:02:25.860> making

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
recording your length accurately making

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.760 
recording your length accurately making
sure<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:27.240> move<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.020> stop<00:02:28.350> after

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
sure that you don't move the stop after

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.000 
sure that you don't move the stop after
you've<00:02:29.430> taken<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.910> x-ray<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.890> you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you've taken the x-ray and that you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.580 
you've taken the x-ray and that you
don't<00:02:32.220> put<00:02:32.520> too<00:02:33.150> sharp<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.630> bend<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.200> file

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
don't put too sharp a bend in the file

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.860 
don't put too sharp a bend in the file
so<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.070> breaks<00:02:35.250> off<00:02:35.520> into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.970> canal<00:02:36.270> if

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
so it breaks off into the canal if

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.990 
so it breaks off into the canal if
you're<00:02:37.140> careful<00:02:37.440> your<00:02:38.190> results<00:02:38.640> will<00:02:38.790> turn

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you're careful your results will turn

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.690 
you're careful your results will turn
out<00:02:39.180> good<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.370> you'll<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> successful
