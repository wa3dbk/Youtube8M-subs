tell you a little bit about what I think
are<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> important<00:00:31.529> features<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.859> consider

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
are the important features to consider

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.030 
are the important features to consider
when<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> select<00:00:33.120> speaker<00:00:33.420> cable<00:00:34.040> first

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
when you select speaker cable first

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.400 
when you select speaker cable first
thing<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.570> example<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.260> which

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
thing is that on this example here which

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.760 
thing is that on this example here which
happens<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.829> 16<00:00:38.309> gauge<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:39.510> utilize<00:00:39.930> 65

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
happens to be 16 gauge we utilize 65

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490 
happens to be 16 gauge we utilize 65
strands<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.640> 65<00:00:42.180> strands<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
strands the 65 strands is going to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
strands the 65 strands is going to
assure<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.100> quality<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.600> speaker

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
assure you quality and your speaker

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
assure you quality and your speaker
installations<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.489> also<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> prevent

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
installations it's also going to prevent

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 
installations it's also going to prevent
any<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> corrosion<00:00:49.079> over<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.789> long<00:00:51.030> term

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
any kind of corrosion over the long term

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
any kind of corrosion over the long term
the<00:00:52.079> other<00:00:52.199> nice<00:00:52.410> thing<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.649> our<00:00:52.860> cable<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the other nice thing about our cable is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.240 
the other nice thing about our cable is
that<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.329> incorporate<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.320> call<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.860> pull

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that we incorporate what we call a pull

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
that we incorporate what we call a pull
string<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> each<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.660> cables<00:00:58.500> this

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
string and each of our cables this

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.979 
string and each of our cables this
allows<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> strip<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> jacket<00:01:00.149> easily<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
allows you to strip the jacket easily to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.189 
allows you to strip the jacket easily to
get<00:01:01.109> access<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.489> two<00:01:02.640> conductors<00:01:02.989> as<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
get access to the two conductors as you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.280 
get access to the two conductors as you
can<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.799> conductors<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.960> black<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
can see the two conductors are black and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.890 
can see the two conductors are black and
red<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.610> reason<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> lot<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
red and the reason for that is a lot of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
red and the reason for that is a lot of
speakers<00:01:10.200> require<00:01:10.619> polarity<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.030> black

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
speakers require polarity so the black

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.850 
speakers require polarity so the black
is<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.600> negative<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.110> your<00:01:13.470> register

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
is for negative and your register

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
is for negative and your register
positive<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.180> other<00:01:15.330> nice<00:01:15.540> thing<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
positive the other nice thing about the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
positive the other nice thing about the
jacket<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> material<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.430> made<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
jacket is the material it's made out of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
jacket is the material it's made out of
this<00:01:18.659> particular<00:01:19.170> jacket<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.860> our

this particular jacket and all our

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.929 
this particular jacket and all our
cables<00:01:20.400> has<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:20.939> call<00:01:21.290> AC<00:01:22.290> l3<00:01:23.100> R<00:01:23.310> rating

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
cables has what we call AC l3 R rating

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
cables has what we call AC l3 R rating
now<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> means<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.200> riser<00:01:25.470> rated<00:01:26.040> which

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
now that means it's riser rated which

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
now that means it's riser rated which
means<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> commercial

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
means you can use it in a commercial

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.359 
means you can use it in a commercial
application<00:01:27.720> whether<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> mid<00:01:28.950> rise<00:01:29.100> or

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
lower gauge wires like for example this

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
lower gauge wires like for example this
happens<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> 14-2<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.210> also<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> 12-2

happens to be a 14-2 we also make a 12-2
is<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.580> strand<00:02:08.879> count<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.509> are

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
is that the strand count on these are

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
is that the strand count on these are
105<00:02:10.709> strand<00:02:11.129> remember<00:02:11.910> previously<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> said

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
105 strand remember previously I said

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.880 
105 strand remember previously I said
16-gauge<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.550> 65<00:02:14.940> strand<00:02:15.269> your<00:02:15.959> 14-gauge<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
16-gauge was 65 strand your 14-gauge and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.000 
16-gauge was 65 strand your 14-gauge and
your<00:02:17.340> 12-gauge<00:02:17.819> or<00:02:18.300> 105<00:02:18.750> strand<00:02:19.110> again<00:02:19.830> this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
your 12-gauge or 105 strand again this

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.770 
your 12-gauge or 105 strand again this
is<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> assure<00:02:20.700> quality<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.450> minimize

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
is going to assure quality and minimize

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.530 
is going to assure quality and minimize
corrosion<00:02:22.050> over<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.650> long<00:02:22.860> term<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:24.390> other

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
corrosion over the long term the other

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.089 
corrosion over the long term the other
thing<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.019> think<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.379> really<00:02:25.680> nice<00:02:25.890> about

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
thing that I think is really nice about

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.940 
thing that I think is really nice about
these<00:02:26.340> cables<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.209> if<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.800> an

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
these cables is that if you have an

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.580 
these cables is that if you have an
application<00:02:29.129> where<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:30.989> long<00:02:31.319> run

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
application where you have a long run

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.890 
application where you have a long run
for<00:02:31.830> example<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.940> might<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.269> trying<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.720> power

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
for example you might be trying to power
