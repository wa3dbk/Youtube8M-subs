00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
fake then f don't get you to rake up the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
fake then f don't get you to rake up the
jetpack<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.730> spawned<00:00:57.090> inside<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> iaa

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
jetpack so it spawned inside the iaa

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.529 
jetpack so it spawned inside the iaa
building<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.850> believe<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.390> he<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
building if you believe what he is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.979 
building if you believe what he is
saying

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
saying

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.130 
saying
so<00:01:01.649> before<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.070> enter<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> iaa<00:01:03.270> building<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so before you enter the iaa building it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.929 
so before you enter the iaa building it
says<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.619> need<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.860> shoot<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.580> windows

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
says you need to shoot some windows

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
says you need to shoot some windows
first<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.010> i<00:01:08.040> dead<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
first and as you can see here i dead of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.960 
first and as you can see here i dead of
course

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
course

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
course
now<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.360> says<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.960> jump<00:01:10.320> inside<00:01:10.680> building

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
now it says just jump inside building

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
now it says just jump inside building
and<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:11.790> find<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> jetpack<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> end

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and you will find the jetpack at the end

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
and you will find the jetpack at the end
of<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> room<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> did<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.060> course<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.689> guess

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of the room so I did of course and guess

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
of the room so I did of course and guess
what<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.619> didn't<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.220> anything<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
what I didn't see anything here also to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
what I didn't see anything here also to
confirm<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.259> his<00:01:19.530> video<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> fake<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.580> went<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
confirm that his video is fake I went to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240 
confirm that his video is fake I went to
the<00:01:21.119> address<00:01:21.299> he<00:01:21.780> says<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.619> need<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> go<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the address he says you need to go to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.270 
the address he says you need to go to
get<00:01:23.880> successfully<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.869> jetpack<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.650> again

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
get successfully the jetpack and again

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789 
get successfully the jetpack and again
there<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> nothing<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.110> did<00:01:28.320> some<00:01:28.560> really

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
there is nothing it just did some really

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.490 
there is nothing it just did some really
good<00:01:29.070> research<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.479> example<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.079> garage

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
good research for example the garage

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.429 
good research for example the garage
always<00:01:31.950> opens<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> drive<00:01:33.240> by<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
always opens when you drive by so that

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.640 
always opens when you drive by so that
place<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.159> perfect<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> use<00:01:36.030> -<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
place was just perfect to use - that you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
place was just perfect to use - that you
guys<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.189> oh<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.790> god<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:39.509> opens

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
guys think oh my god it actually opens

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
guys think oh my god it actually opens
oh<00:01:40.140> my<00:01:40.380> god<00:01:40.590> oh<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:40.920> god<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.970> jetpack<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
oh my god oh my god the jetpack is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.639 
oh my god oh my god the jetpack is
inside<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.170> true<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.950> true<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:46.380> yeah

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
inside it's true it's all true but yeah

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
inside it's true it's all true but yeah
I'm<00:01:46.770> pretty<00:01:46.979> sure<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.579> jetpack<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.149> made

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I'm pretty sure the jetpack was made

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.530 
I'm pretty sure the jetpack was made
with<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> program<00:01:49.350> called<00:01:49.860> bojong<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.729> then

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
with a program called bojong and then

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.649 
with a program called bojong and then
was<00:01:52.110> much<00:01:52.380> interact<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.040> cinema<00:01:53.430> 4d<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
was much interact in cinema 4d so it

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.560 
was much interact in cinema 4d so it
fits<00:01:54.930> about<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.259> video<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.219> moving

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
fits about the video and it's not moving

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
fits about the video and it's not moving
then<00:01:57.570> any<00:01:57.840> video<00:01:58.259> which<00:01:58.409> shows<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:59.040> examples

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
then any video which shows some examples

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.340 
then any video which shows some examples
when<00:01:59.939> he<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> flying<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> jetpack

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
when he is flying with the jetpack

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the fire water is coming out of the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.569 
the fire water is coming out of the
jetpack<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:04.079> also<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.649> made<00:02:04.860> an<00:02:05.100> editing

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
jetpack can also be made an editing

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.429 
jetpack can also be made an editing
program

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
program

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.590 
program
and<00:02:06.530> also<00:02:07.220> if<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.460> look<00:02:07.640> closely<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.360> pot

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
and also if you look closely to the pot

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.870 
and also if you look closely to the pot
when<00:02:08.869> he<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.080> flying<00:02:09.380> with<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.800> jetpack<00:02:10.039> you

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
when he is flying with the jetpack you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.580 
when he is flying with the jetpack you
see<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.330> first<00:02:11.569> clip<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.110> done<00:02:12.319> with<00:02:12.560> a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
see in the first clip it's done with a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.100 
see in the first clip it's done with a
cheat<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.730> G<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:13.970> makes<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.540> jump<00:02:14.870> higher

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
cheat the G that makes you jump higher

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.410 
cheat the G that makes you jump higher
and<00:02:15.410> yeah<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.100> jumped<00:02:16.790> somewhere<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and yeah I just jumped somewhere and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.260 
and yeah I just jumped somewhere and
refers<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.200> screen<00:02:18.560> look<00:02:19.370> at<00:02:19.520> his<00:02:19.670> hands<00:02:20.060> it's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
refers the screen look at his hands it's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.630 
refers the screen look at his hands it's
all<00:02:20.480> fake<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> second<00:02:22.220> clip<00:02:22.400> in

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
all fake and then in the second clip in

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.180 
all fake and then in the second clip in
Skyfall<00:02:23.000> mode<00:02:23.450> if<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.080> look<00:02:24.350> closely<00:02:24.620> Trevor

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
Skyfall mode if you look closely Trevor

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.160 
Skyfall mode if you look closely Trevor
had<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> parachute<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.180> his<00:02:26.330> back<00:02:26.569> so<00:02:26.600> that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
had a parachute on his back so that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.830 
had a parachute on his back so that
means<00:02:27.440> jetpack<00:02:28.100> was<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:29.030> put<00:02:29.300> up<00:02:29.540> there

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
means jetpack was just put up there

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.630 
means jetpack was just put up there
because<00:02:30.410> why<00:02:30.739> would<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.069> need<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> parachute

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
because why would you need a parachute

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.390 
because why would you need a parachute
if<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.090> got<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> jetpack<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
if you got a jetpack and then in the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.370 
if you got a jetpack and then in the
last<00:02:34.580> clip<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.120> clearly<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.840> again<00:02:36.170> his

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
last clip you clearly see again his

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.009 
last clip you clearly see again his
hands<00:02:36.890> he<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.940> jumped<00:02:38.390> off<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.810> building

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
hands he just jumped off the building

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.530 
hands he just jumped off the building
and<00:02:39.470> reversed<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.880> looks<00:02:41.180> like<00:02:41.300> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
and reversed it so it looks like you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.840 
and reversed it so it looks like you
take<00:02:41.750> off<00:02:41.989> with<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> jetpack<00:02:42.590> also<00:02:43.340> when<00:02:43.519> Jim

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
take off with the jetpack also when Jim

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.420 
take off with the jetpack also when Jim
moody<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.390> driving<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.260> garage<00:02:45.650> where<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
moody is driving to the garage where you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.580 
moody is driving to the garage where you
need<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.940> find<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.600> jetpack

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
need to go to find the jetpack

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.979 
need to go to find the jetpack
eventually<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.790> see<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:50.209> not<00:02:50.420> spinning<00:02:50.690> in

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
eventually you see it's not spinning in

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.500 
eventually you see it's not spinning in
the<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> beginning<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.819> moves<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.480> bit

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
the in the beginning and it moves a bit

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.770 
the in the beginning and it moves a bit
