 inside and outside the cell launches 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.950
 nutrient delivery mechanism 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.660

 synthesize hydrochloric acid in the stomach 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.629
 which causes the digestive

 cardiovascular diseases 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.810
 joint problems cataract development 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.880
 moreover, salt damage can lead to

 salt exceeds the norm of 10 and even more 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.509
 times already in many big cities 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.939
 there is an active explanatory work on

 work managed to reduce the number of 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.040
 consumed product by a third 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.869
 after which the death rate from heart attacks and 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.869
 strokes reduced by 80 percent
