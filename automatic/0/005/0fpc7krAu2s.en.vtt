00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.630 
to defend so what we have to be is
endless<00:00:41.330> so<00:00:41.630> no<00:00:41.900> I<00:00:41.930> think<00:00:42.230> every<00:00:42.530> position<00:00:42.830> on

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
endless so no I think every position on

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.670 
endless so no I think every position on
the<00:00:43.790> court<00:00:44.030> is<00:00:44.180> scared<00:00:44.660> very<00:00:45.020> important

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
the court is scared very important

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.830 
the court is scared very important
otherwise<00:00:46.270> obviously<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:47.390> wouldn't<00:00:47.600> have<00:00:47.810> a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
otherwise obviously you wouldn't have a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.360 
otherwise obviously you wouldn't have a
team<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:52.000> don't<00:00:53.000> really<00:00:53.180> do<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.930> lot<00:00:54.350> actually<00:00:55.070> I

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
team I don't really do a lot actually I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.280 
team I don't really do a lot actually I
guess<00:00:55.700> just<00:00:56.000> hanging<00:00:56.570> around<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.990> change

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
guess just hanging around the change

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.610 
guess just hanging around the change
rooms<00:00:57.680> talking<00:00:58.640> I<00:00:59.000> like<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.329> keep<00:00:59.480> it<00:00:59.690> pretty

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
rooms talking I like to keep it pretty

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.790 
rooms talking I like to keep it pretty
light-hearted<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.930> yeah<00:01:02.930> keep<00:01:03.260> chatting<00:01:03.560> to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800

everyone<00:01:04.040> listen<00:01:04.399> to<00:01:04.519> me<00:01:04.670> as<00:01:04.729> if<00:01:04.909> I<00:01:05.089> probably

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
everyone listen to me as if I probably

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
everyone listen to me as if I probably
don't<00:01:06.020> take<00:01:06.289> it<00:01:06.469> too<00:01:06.619> seriously

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.520 

I<00:01:10.939> think<00:01:11.939> every<00:01:12.270> team<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.229> tough

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I think every team is going to be tough

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.779 
I think every team is going to be tough
I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.149> competition<00:01:15.719> is<00:01:15.810> really

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
I think the competition is really

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.099 
I think the competition is really
strengthened<00:01:17.789> this<00:01:18.119> year<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.659> player

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
strengthened this year with player

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.200 
strengthened this year with player
movement<00:01:19.469> and<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.219> think<00:01:20.399> especially<00:01:20.490> over<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
movement and I think especially over in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.169 
movement and I think especially over in
New<00:01:21.390> Zealand<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.929> teams<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:23.340> gotten<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.000> lot

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
New Zealand the teams have gotten a lot

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:31.580 
New Zealand the teams have gotten a lot
stronger<00:01:27.860> my<00:01:28.860> goals<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.390> 2010<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.750> two
