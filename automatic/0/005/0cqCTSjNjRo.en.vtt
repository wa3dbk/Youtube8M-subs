00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.670 
next step is to saute the mushrooms
sought<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.660> really<00:02:10.989> just<00:02:11.170> means<00:02:11.320> taking

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
sought a really just means taking

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.509 
sought a really just means taking
mushrooms<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.050> case<00:02:14.320> putting<00:02:15.250> them<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.459> a

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
mushrooms in this case putting them in a

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.300 
mushrooms in this case putting them in a
pan<00:02:16.110> heating<00:02:17.110> them<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.560> pretty<00:02:18.220> much

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
pan heating them up and pretty much

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.390 
pan heating them up and pretty much
constantly<00:02:19.090> moving<00:02:19.870> them<00:02:20.110> around<00:02:20.170> now<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
constantly moving them around now the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.360 
constantly moving them around now the
mushrooms<00:02:21.700> are<00:02:22.360> going<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.870> absorb<00:02:23.340> some<00:02:24.340> of

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
mushrooms are going to absorb some of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
mushrooms are going to absorb some of
the<00:02:24.489> veal<00:02:25.000> juice<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.540> butter<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:26.019> are

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the veal juice and the butter that are

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.289 
the veal juice and the butter that are
left<00:02:26.470> over<00:02:26.650> from<00:02:27.160> when<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:27.549> sauteed<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.090> deal

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
left over from when we sauteed the deal

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.449 
left over from when we sauteed the deal
in<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:29.799> could<00:02:29.980> really<00:02:30.250> taste

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
in here so there could really taste

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.039 
in here so there could really taste
delicious<00:02:30.820> when<00:02:31.150> they're<00:02:31.269> done<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.900> will
