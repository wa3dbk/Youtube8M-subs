00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.219
 Today 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.360
 I am learning Korean now 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.460
 I have something like a test tomorrow I found 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.390
 imagine a korean language school 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 this cultural center itself is called there 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.220
 Japanese is not taught at all in my opinion 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.289
 Chinese is shorter cool and slow 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 like for very cute 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.349
 teachers 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.899
 I will come tomorrow I have a test I need 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.200
 learn all the words you learned for 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.690
 I learned four lessons more precisely in four 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 lesson and should learn her now I 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.420
 I try to shove my blondie head well 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 since i don't really like teaching at all 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 I do not know how to read words for reading 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 something well that's exactly the words to teach for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.899
 me this is a little dog not at all 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.570
 like learning korean it's interesting 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.199
 it is different but very different from ours 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.830
 language 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.170
 really, well, if you do not take into account what 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.320
 He generally letters and there other whale 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.659
 sticks all sorts of circles different itself 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.270
 grammar and sentence building then 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.330
 there is a noun middle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:31.320
 the verb here is such a Korean 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:32.640
 walnut hamburgers seen well here 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.299
 I learn Korean 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.350
 their own homemade blouses me video 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.299
 recorded one does not mean I will hide 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 generally learn the words pretty yet 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.740
 just but the trick is that the words 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.750
 very quickly fly out of my head because 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.119
 that too, well, I do not use them to take 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.430
 every day now six o'clock 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.290
 pm i sit over this korean 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.490
 miserable inside i'm sobbing i'm already 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.140
 tired still need to learn the page once 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.140
 2 pages 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.050
 in short, that's my jolly 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.390
 jolly going on in my life or 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.210
 I know probably in the majority of bloggers 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.210
 life and fun they are saturated with something 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:32.680
 do when it comes to what i do 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:33.370
 on this here are books and notebooks even books 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.840
 I do not have 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.320
 i'm printing i am now without makeup like you 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.810
 may have noticed all my post-acne 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.780
 I bought myself an expensive serum for 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.060
 I don't know the faces of any of these spots 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.580
 I hope to help 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.270
 because to be honest, I have everything already 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.890
 sick of bibi cream and that is 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.310
 in Korean concealer and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.650
 but of course any European 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.600
 brands have long grabbed this 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.530
 chip and put it there, too, would be 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.000
 creams yourself 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.550
 but I think it's better to pay back 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.970
 original bibi cream asian than 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.739
 buy in European brands which i 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.690
 I think that they are not even the technology 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.610
 Asians use a 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.560
 can not be bought a patent 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.950
 This idea of muscle community bought just 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.050
 make an idea but they use the wrong ones 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.560
 those products to make this bibi cream 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.959
 so better asian better and better and 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 better korean to buy because they 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.670
 really don't really spoil the skin 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.959
 there are a lot of all sorts of mineral pieces 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.709
 which are the opposite 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.280
 acne from what you want moisturizes very 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.130
 protects well from the sun, we are shorter 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.860
 better go better perry korean pussy 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.080
 I use to buy bits of cream and in general 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 earlier every day beautiful devi cream 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.970
 then this is years and she began to heal 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.980
 skin ceased to paint at all but 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.989
 now I also have skin 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.370
 it became better to paint new because 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:12.920
 all these spots are moronic 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.709
 just sometimes you have to gloss over 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.720
 baby cream again but since since if you 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.549
 just fill up here just a little bit anyway 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.490
 it will be like a stain and therefore have to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.590
 make out completely and so if you 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.650
 use some kind of makeup from 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.530
 age spots or again and on the void 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.570

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.380

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.470
