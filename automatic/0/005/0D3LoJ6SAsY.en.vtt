00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone, Evgeny, we continue with 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.770
 you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.130
 carving thread in the last lesson we 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.089
 you cut out such an element as a spikelet 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.070
 can look from the parcel on the herd 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.550
 today we will continue our lesson 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 our classes today will complicate the element 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.750
 spikelet will be cut by carrots 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.650
 there is already a pain hard and you than 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 you can use this element where 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.520
 can decorate sushi salad or some 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.309
 banquet dish so let's get started for 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.340
 this we need a wide knife then 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.949
 I have already cut our billet 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.640
 in half that is, cut our carrots here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.530
 then we take the Thai knife and start 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.430
 round this one 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 a thick tip that is, we make a semicircle with 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.510
 one side do not make a semicircle behind 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.640
 the other side, that is, the knife we ​​have 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.640
 on the surface of carrots 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.360
 also round our blank 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:34.100
 do you get such a blank 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:36.790
 Now we will cut on it for 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.160
 just take this thai knife again 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.110
 retreat about half a floor a centimeter from 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.770
 edges and cut that is cut the photo 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.270
 right angle and at the end we round it up 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.670
 there is now I held the line and rounded out 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 then this line is clipping at 45 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.869
 degrees and round it too bring here 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.090
 our last movement is 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:11.300
 round it up now on the other hand i 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.860
 again cutting through at right angles and going on 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.860
 circle and rounding 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.489
 that is, we get this 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.890
 harvesting and so continue to the very 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.970
 the end that is, we retreat by about half 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:36.549
 centimeters doing again 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.640
 log and movement cut from any 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.640
 country 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.569
 cut off 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.280
 one side 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.880
 and on the other hand that is all the line y 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:04.600
 we should be symmetrical and with one 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:10.840
 sides and on the other here I am now 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:15.610
 pulling out our cut that is 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.610
 mind along the carrot 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.879
 here 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.969
 color cut through and at the end 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.739
 i.e 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:43.870
 doing this little thing that is again 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.629
 finally pull out here in just two 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.549
 minutes we have such a spikelet 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.560
 you will have it a little longer so 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.129
 do not despair exercise at home 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.840
