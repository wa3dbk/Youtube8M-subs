00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.140
 ah 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.769
 hello youtuber today I bring you a 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.230
 discovery that I found playing in 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.050
 the p esp is about the big vice car 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.660
 city ​​stories note some errors fails 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.940
 or glitches as you like to call them 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.309
 and they called my attention and ask me 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.860
 why do not I upload them and well here I 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.809
 They have only two glitches and I'm going to 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.409
 explain how they originate good 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.409
 let's start 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.129
 number 1 clips 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.110
 to cause this first fail they will need 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.040
 the weapon known as the revolver the one 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.040
 come next 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.270
 now they have to look for a car with a 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.340
 driver and they point him in the head and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.350
 now they shoot and they will see how the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.330
 illusion that an invisible man what 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 takes out of the car with blows and when 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.860
 You shoot and on the ground moves in 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.860
 slow motion like a pinche trout xd 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 and so they can see that I'm not lying 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680
 I will show you how a person dies 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.409
 normal for this will need a weapon of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.600
 high power as the following attach you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.460
 in the head and they shoot and they will see as if 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 his head flies and he even drips 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.390
 blood x of now believe me number clips 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.390
 two 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.510
 for this they will need the weapon they see 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.640
 then now you have to go 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.340
 walking then aim and quickly 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.650
 just leave pressing the r button and you will see 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.720
 how it walks automatically since it 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.720
 is pointing to where you indicate it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 did youtubers to see my first video 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.209

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.069

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.069
