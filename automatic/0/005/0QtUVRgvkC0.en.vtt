00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
they've got pretty good or work on the

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.940 
they've got pretty good or work on the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
disk it's not as colorful or as

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.039 
disk it's not as colorful or as
eye-catching<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.700> manual<00:02:57.299> or<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.840> cover

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
eye-catching as the manual or the cover

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.170 
eye-catching as the manual or the cover
of<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.319> game<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:58.739> as<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.280> see<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.819> back

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
of the game but as you can see the back

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.309 
of the game but as you can see the back
cover<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:01.370> purely<00:03:02.370> white<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.209> there's<00:03:03.390> no<00:03:03.690> it's

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
cover is purely white so there's no it's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.220 
cover is purely white so there's no it's
not<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> reversible<00:03:04.980> cover<00:03:05.220> which<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> shame

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
not a reversible cover which is a shame

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.000 
not a reversible cover which is a shame
but<00:03:07.230> once<00:03:07.590> again<00:03:07.739> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.489> expected<00:03:10.010> most

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
but once again kind of expected most

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.500 
but once again kind of expected most
companies<00:03:11.340> these<00:03:11.549> days<00:03:11.610> don't<00:03:12.030> really<00:03:12.299> add<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
companies these days don't really add a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.050 
companies these days don't really add a
whole<00:03:12.780> lot<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.230> inside<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.560> box<00:03:13.920> which<00:03:14.910> is

whole lot to inside the box which is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.120 
whole lot to inside the box which is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
unfortunate if you ask me but it's the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.809 
unfortunate if you ask me but it's the
way<00:03:17.250> things<00:03:17.310> are<00:03:17.700> now<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:19.319> there<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.650> go<00:03:19.819> that
