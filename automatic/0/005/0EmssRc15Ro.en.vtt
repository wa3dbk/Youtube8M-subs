00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 all welcome greeting you pzh 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.180
 warrior comrades before I start in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.580
 This video talk on the topic I will say that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.889
 the second part of the interview with the ears will not 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.290
 for the material that I have left is not 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.780
 enough one more issue to the same 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.560
 something particularly interesting there you are not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.449
 already left 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.090
 but if someone does not care 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.279
 interesting then i can upload the full version 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 interview with the group here's the abysses in 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 audio recording of course write about this in 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.250
 comments and now we come to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.460
 consideration of today's unit 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.770
 meet the panther 88 bout going on 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.899
 map of the monastery I'm in a platoon with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 to my fellows tearing hamster 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.879
 who plays french buns mx 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.340
 Odessa and immediately ask the question why everyone 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.710
 so they smear this tank well, he's pretty 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.719
 not bad, I'm talking about 88 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 contrary to general opinion as well as hamish 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.820
 I think that Panther 8 is far from a cactus 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 why is it so well first mobility 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.449
 she is certainly not like sidisi and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.910
 other Altai like st 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.940
 but also a good move from flank to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.250
 flank can be quite successful and fast 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 maximum speed 48 kilometers an hour is enough that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.600
 As for turning, it also happens 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.939
 better of course but also come down 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 the gun of this unit is also quite good 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.200
 accuracy of information would say just 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 excellent and even breakdowns 200 with something 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.580
 millimeters allows you to cause damage to all 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 eighth and ninth levels with dozens and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.900
 everything is a bit more complicated of course 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.600
 and sometimes you have to charge the gold but 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.530
 I personally drive only 7 podkaliberov and me 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.329
 quite enough 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.210
 Yes, and recharge quickly and this instrument 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.280
 in general, my verdict tank is not bad 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 all I wanted to say on the characteristics 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.369
 I said so let's go from theory to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.200
 practice 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.570
 here on our flank where there is only 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.030
 one of our cardboard platoon begins 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.700
 which movement lit up t32 lion and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.399
 kv-3 which allows us to conclude that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.149
 together against three tyazh forehead to us 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.310
 don't hold out 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.530
 a little bags decide which is better 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 from here to the other flank and help 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.149
 our careless allies fight off at least 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.149
 one side and get on df base 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.300
 here of course we were not expected and exchanged 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.070
 a bit hp our platoon on focus 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.440
 sends three tanks to the hangar 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.200
 thereby clearing a platform for 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.600
 quiet protection and by the way here's your proof 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.930
 confirming that the panther can 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.390
 change flanks and now I offer you 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.280
 look at the beatings of the blind ones 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.390
 Comfortable shelves straight cute 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.390
 shooting does not want 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.080
 getting rid of the main danger on 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.330
 Allied base my sovzvvodny decided 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 check the entrances to our position behind 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.460
 which was also crowned with success behind the knoll 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.620
 lit a clumsy British Fri-shka 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.770
 I was on my panther Hyper was stretching to Mecca 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.030
 and would tanks one shot from at15 drove 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.610
 to her board that's all 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.770
 tortilla larva neutralized by the way 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 please note our platoon has just been 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.190
 in position 2 against five 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.080
 sort of platoon kolobanov turns 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.720
 now it's time to come back for 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.820
 survivor t32 who apparently did not want 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 remain at the ally base and decided 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.590
 go somewhere but I think not far we take 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.420
 heading for an enemy circle of capture and right there 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.430
 from the corner on us flies the very 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.350
 american tyazh who could not 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.920
 nothing to do, and he did not even art 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.920
 helped 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.080
 further we continue our movement to 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.180
 enemy stronghold driving on the shelf 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.890
 located opposite the enemy base and 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.080
 apparently in each of 3 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.190
 And also for a moment we will look at my 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.800
 number of frags 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.230
 their five enemies are intact and this 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.390
 it means that easy redex 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.090
 platoon I have already agreed and then look 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.860
 what happens from starting to burn after 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.410
 shots front rink 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:54.030
 from sitis and the most crucial moment I 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.519
 I do not break Isa the third into the board 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.620
 honestly oh well quick 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.890
 We deal with Arta and take victory in 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.110
 this battle 11 frags 9 thousand damage and five 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.000
 medals on a platoon according to the form is called 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.519
 and this is all expensive comrades 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.299
 I hope you understand that the panther is far from 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.700
 cactus 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.799
 vylakal for you warrior well, someone else 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.489
 be so thank you all for your attention and to 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.489
 new meetings
