what we got and we've gotten some really
fantastic<00:00:28.430> results<00:00:29.330> earlier<00:00:30.170> today<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:30.769> can

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
fantastic results earlier today you can

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.270 
fantastic results earlier today you can
see<00:00:31.099> how<00:00:31.369> we<00:00:31.430> go<00:00:31.640> here<00:00:31.939> lets<00:00:32.859> you<00:00:33.859> know<00:00:34.010> kind<00:00:34.249> of

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
see how we go here lets you know kind of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
see how we go here lets you know kind of
getting<00:00:34.460> up<00:00:34.639> there<00:00:34.879> definitely

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.030 

more<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:37.989> more<00:00:38.050> people<00:00:38.290> are<00:00:38.530> on<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.829> network

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
more and more people are on the network

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.180 
more and more people are on the network
here<00:00:39.940> in<00:00:40.090> this<00:00:40.180> area<00:00:40.420> but

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
here in this area but

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.060 
here in this area but
we<00:00:42.579> go<00:00:44.039> upstream<00:00:45.039> as<00:00:45.309> well<00:00:45.579> yeah<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.949> bit

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
we go upstream as well yeah it's a bit

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.180 
we go upstream as well yeah it's a bit
average<00:00:48.399> from<00:00:48.610> what<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:48.789> see<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:51.039> we've

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
average from what I see actually we've

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.250 
average from what I see actually we've
got<00:00:51.339> it<00:00:51.489> even<00:00:51.699> faster<00:00:51.969> than<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.629> yet<00:00:53.110> again

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
got it even faster than that yet again

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.439 
got it even faster than that yet again
depending<00:00:53.829> on<00:00:53.949> how<00:00:54.460> much<00:00:54.610> how<00:00:55.149> many<00:00:55.329> people

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
depending on how much how many people

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.880 
depending on how much how many people
are<00:00:55.600> actually<00:00:55.659> using<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.140> network<00:00:56.379> at<00:00:56.649> once

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
are actually using the network at once

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.860 
are actually using the network at once
yeah<00:00:57.159> bigger<00:00:57.399> yeah<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.239> so<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.449> can<00:00:58.629> see<00:00:58.719> some

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
yeah bigger yeah and so you can see some

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.569 
yeah bigger yeah and so you can see some
of<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.019> results<00:00:59.140> we've<00:00:59.530> had<00:00:59.829> kind<00:01:00.159> of<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.309> range

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
of the results we've had kind of a range

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.639 
of the results we've had kind of a range
again<00:01:00.909> as<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:01.210> network<00:01:01.479> congestion<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:02.140> but

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
again as the network congestion is but

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.770 
again as the network congestion is but
in<00:01:03.190> kind<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.760> normal<00:01:04.330> more<00:01:04.449> normal

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
in kind of the normal more normal

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.930 
in kind of the normal more normal
situations<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.560> we've<00:01:05.740> seen<00:01:05.920> some<00:01:06.159> rates<00:01:06.759> up

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
situations and we've seen some rates up

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.999 
situations and we've seen some rates up
to<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.360> was<00:01:07.509> just<00:01:07.690> earlier<00:01:07.930> today<00:01:07.960> yeah<00:01:08.530> 41

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
to this was just earlier today yeah 41

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.240 
to this was just earlier today yeah 41
at<00:01:09.340> 37<00:01:10.320> megabits<00:01:11.320> per<00:01:11.380> second<00:01:11.799> down<00:01:12.009> though<00:01:12.220> I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
at 37 megabits per second down though I

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.520 
at 37 megabits per second down though I
mean<00:01:12.460> that's<00:01:12.549> really<00:01:13.090> really<00:01:13.299> fast<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.110> could

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
mean that's really really fast so could

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.080 
mean that's really really fast so could
you<00:01:14.619> talk<00:01:14.770> briefly<00:01:14.950> about<00:01:15.220> like<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.729> work<00:01:15.909> it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
you talk briefly about like the work it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090 
you talk briefly about like the work it
took<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.300> add<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.990> new<00:01:17.170> network<00:01:17.530> bands<00:01:17.800> to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
took to add the new network bands to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.139 
took to add the new network bands to
this<00:01:18.250> phone<00:01:18.429> like<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.759> something<00:01:19.090> that's

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
this phone like is that something that's

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.190 
this phone like is that something that's
eventually<00:01:19.360> going<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.780> come<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.080> other

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
eventually going to come to the other

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.469 
eventually going to come to the other
