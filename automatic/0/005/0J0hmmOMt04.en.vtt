00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello all nice that you to me 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.750
 Having found today shows you how to 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.320
 this drape of land makes you 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.520
 In English , the work is called the word 16 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.270
 probably all of that too 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.670
 the hipster area i show that now 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.870
 At this saved the rose and the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.550
 leaves are already a bit dry 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.230
 because I think he took the picture only a few 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.870
 days later have been so surprised 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.610
 do not you guys around 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.559
 ok we start we do not need either 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.360
 much to your choice 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.720
 So color of choice 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.489
 I use as usual mass gino traffic 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.200
 I think that's nothing new for you 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.579
 and all I do now is it 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.739
 Roll out relatively thin even almost 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.270
 thinner than if i did that by 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.649
 land is completely at stake as 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.790
 when i hit the pie i have 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.230
 The feeling I have a little more 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.210
 control over it and that just looks 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 much more discreet than if you were one 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.300
 important piece of hand again there 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.829
 After all , we eat on top of it 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.180
 already a layer of land mostly and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.579
 then I'm not a fan of it if 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.719
 then you get some more from land 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:13.069
 is that if you are all that 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.130
 have rolled out nice then you take 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.649
 Do you have any long woods or 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.939
 something long slim something 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.649
 put her under the land now 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.709
 how could I do it now? 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.509
 Let's just say that salad 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.279
 fork and a cooking spoon if 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.569
 you may have long straws for 

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:31.609
 for example would work as super 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.859
 so sangria straw or if you like that 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.119
 wooden sticks or something have got there 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.619
 then you can do that too, for example 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.959
 great use something on everyone 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.579
 what you put falling under the hand 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:45.079
 so you can fold this one 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.279
 can work a bit and that is 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.649
 even half the rent what you then 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.359
 just make it quite said 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.219
 Carefully take your hand and then 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.349
 Place over the pie over the pie 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.639
 drape and then you still have 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.799
 quite a lot of time and many 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.389
 possibilities that all then so to 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.459
 Let's put that to you the best I like it 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.540
 Now take my pizza cutter and 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:06.340
 just kick me down a bit 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.200
 maybe to the extent I have now 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.050
 rolled just look my coasting died 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.740
 is about 23 cm believe me and beat 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.470
 have the width of about 15 16 cm 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.850
 rolled and in length it is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.950
 actually no matter how long that is glad because 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.630
 that still cut off below 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.920
 we can and we can do something about 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.120
 have to pay the eighth definitely 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.650
 should be that at least 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.290
 clean edges do not have that yours 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.520
 from a bit eroded or at 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.280
 something looks like that they do not stop then 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.350
 pretty awful but that's about 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.610
 actually different means you want yours 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.930
 from quite thin to one 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.700
 certain length and a specific one 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.200
 width then put you any 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.480
 wooden sticks or any 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.610
 any long narrow objects 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.040
 underneath that goes a bit behind 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.580
 Then we'll take you out of the fondant 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.680
 Carefully on the pie and there you can 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.250
 you still drape so far 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.320
 happy with it since I mean pinch 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.700
 fondant mostly in the middle once and 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.590
 then put it there I usually have then 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 Something flowers something on it 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.320
 should come or if not something 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.090
 others have any shape or something 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.980
 have modeled then you can do that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.810
 for example , if you do that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.310
 do not want to pinch then you can 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.780
 you let that be completely so that 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.100
 just as it lay on the cake 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 but I think it is just like that again 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.440
 a little bit more 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.209
 yes and that was it then as already 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.769
 just said that it is now only one page 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.570
 that's why it looks a bit like that 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.820
 company money on the sides and on top 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.170
 So the city does not worry 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.420
 how is not so determined from mine 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.190
 House 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.410
 ok so all looked then also 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.450
 at the three floors that dress that 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.500
 that's exactly the same thing except me 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.640
 a bit shorter from the beginning 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.230
 held 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.940
 because I do not have that over the whole 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.780
 could only place pie over the 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.130
 strings and you can either with the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.140
 a bit more access for example 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.630
 attach or a bit of water if 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.890
 your luck in the misfortune then it can 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.299
 be the euro may even pie 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.100
 already sticks and sweats a bit 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.769
 then you could stick to it 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.060
 so the handling is relative 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.830
 easy and if you do that two or three times 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.170
 made did you see that 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.240
 actually always directly super 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.500
 okay that's it then again 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.150
 I hope you have the short video 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.720
 you might like something 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.310
 learn 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.989
 the other videos would like to see from 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.780
 click on the right and left 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.360
 who has not subscribed to me yet he has 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.800
 Of course, that will catch up quickly 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.270
 who has any video wishes or 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.590
 leave any comments meters 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.980
 Of course he wants to write that to me 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.600
 and the video and then I hope that 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.710
 we'll see each other again in the next video 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.710
 makes good lives
