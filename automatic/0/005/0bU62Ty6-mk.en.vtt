00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you use your long piece of wire and you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
you use your long piece of wire and you
start<00:00:55.230> off<00:00:55.469> by<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.730> between<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.480> first

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
start off by going in between the first

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.350 
start off by going in between the first
tooth<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.899> wrapping<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> wire<00:01:01.699> around<00:01:05.360> I've

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
tooth and wrapping the wire around I've

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.590 
tooth and wrapping the wire around I've
done<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.810> wrap<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:08.100> grab<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:08.939> crystal

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
done one wrap then grab your crystal

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
done one wrap then grab your crystal
it's<00:01:10.110> easier<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.770> pop<00:01:11.100> them<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.340> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it's easier if you just pop them all on

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.810 
it's easier if you just pop them all on
the<00:01:11.549> desk<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.479> pick<00:01:12.689> them<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.960> from<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.820> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the desk and pick them up from there so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390 
the desk and pick them up from there so
I've<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.240> crystal<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I've got my crystal on and I'm just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.249 
I've got my crystal on and I'm just
gonna<00:01:17.700> hold<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.150> place<00:01:18.330> while<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.750> wrap<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
gonna hold it in place while I wrap the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.399 
gonna hold it in place while I wrap the
wire<00:01:19.439> around<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.720> then<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.020> through<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
wire around and then I go through the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
wire around and then I go through the
next<00:01:22.439> tooth<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.590> around<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.799> comb<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> I'm

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
next tooth and around the comb so I'm

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.710 
next tooth and around the comb so I'm
gonna<00:01:27.750> run<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> way<00:01:28.470> along<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.720> putting

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
gonna run all the way along here putting

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
gonna run all the way along here putting
the<00:01:30.900> crystals<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.939> as<00:01:33.079> my<00:01:34.079> first<00:01:34.470> step

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the crystals on as my first step

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:51.280 
the crystals on as my first step
there<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.290> wrap<00:01:37.650> around

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.160 

okay<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:51.980> that's<00:01:52.280> all<00:01:52.460> my<00:01:52.580> wires<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.480> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
okay so that's all my wires on and the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.590 
okay so that's all my wires on and the
easiest<00:01:54.650> way<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.890> work<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.640> but

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
easiest way to work with it but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.360 
easiest way to work with it but
otherwise<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:57.620> side<00:01:57.860> as<00:01:58.070> you're<00:01:58.220> working

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
otherwise to one side as you're working

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.470 
otherwise to one side as you're working
through<00:01:59.230> now<00:02:00.230> you're<00:02:00.500> going<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.740> take<00:02:00.950> your

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
through now you're going to take your

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.190 
through now you're going to take your
four<00:02:02.480> millimeter<00:02:03.610> crystal<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.960> want<00:02:06.140> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
four millimeter crystal and you want to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.550 
four millimeter crystal and you want to
pop<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:07.000> about<00:02:08.000> halfway<00:02:08.390> down<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.410> wire

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
pop it on about halfway down the wire

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.640 
pop it on about halfway down the wire
now<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.550> remember<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.000> don't<00:02:11.150> need<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.650> use

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
now just remember you don't need to use

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.050 
now just remember you don't need to use
any<00:02:12.860> measuring<00:02:13.340> because<00:02:13.520> if<00:02:13.790> they're<00:02:13.940> all

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
any measuring because if they're all

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.790 
any measuring because if they're all
slightly<00:02:14.330> different<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:15.290> gives<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.650> bit<00:02:15.740> of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
slightly different it gives it a bit of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.340 
slightly different it gives it a bit of
a<00:02:15.920> shimmer<00:02:16.190> straight<00:02:16.550> across<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.300> I've<00:02:18.230> gone

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
a shimmer straight across so I've gone

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.370 
a shimmer straight across so I've gone
about<00:02:18.620> half<00:02:19.040> way<00:02:19.250> down<00:02:19.900> folded<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.990> wire<00:02:21.140> in

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
about half way down folded the wire in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.000 
about half way down folded the wire in
half<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:23.810> underneath<00:02:24.290> my<00:02:24.500> crystal

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
half so that it's underneath my crystal

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.070 
half so that it's underneath my crystal
wrap<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.240> wire<00:02:26.420> around<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.740> stem<00:02:28.900> one<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.050> a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
wrap the wire around the stem one and a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.590 
wrap the wire around the stem one and a
half<00:02:30.200> times<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:31.040> push<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.390> wire

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
half times and then I just push the wire

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.180 
half times and then I just push the wire
back<00:02:33.020> up<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:34.580> I'm<00:02:34.820> ready<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.540> put<00:02:35.959> my

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
back up so now I'm ready to put my

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.240 
back up so now I'm ready to put my
teardrop<00:02:37.190> crystal<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> end<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:40.100> I'm

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
teardrop crystal on to the end so I'm

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.810 
teardrop crystal on to the end so I'm
gonna<00:02:40.430> go<00:02:40.670> up<00:02:43.180> about<00:02:44.180> four<00:02:44.600> centimeters<00:02:45.050> up

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
gonna go up about four centimeters up

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.220 
gonna go up about four centimeters up
fold<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.060> half<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.780> I've<00:02:50.959> got<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
fold it in half so that I've got the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.160 
fold it in half so that I've got the
teardrop<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.920> end<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.600> wire<00:02:53.810> wrapped

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
teardrop at the end and the wire wrapped

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.210 
teardrop at the end and the wire wrapped
around<00:02:54.940> one<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.810> half<00:02:56.989> times<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.830> I'm

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
around one and a half times and I'm

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.400 
around one and a half times and I'm
gonna<00:02:58.459> come<00:02:58.730> back<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.090> trim<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.420> off<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.930> a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
gonna come back and trim that off in a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.320 
gonna come back and trim that off in a
second<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:00.950> that's<00:03:01.070> my<00:03:01.310> first<00:03:01.519> wire<00:03:01.910> done<00:03:04.330> now

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
second so that's my first wire done now

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.990 
second so that's my first wire done now
what<00:03:05.570> you're<00:03:05.660> going<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:06.970> using<00:03:07.970> your

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
what you're going to do using your

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.600 
what you're going to do using your
cutters<00:03:08.690> you're<00:03:09.590> just<00:03:09.950> going<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.220> trim<00:03:10.489> off

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
cutters you're just going to trim off

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.920 
cutters you're just going to trim off
the<00:03:10.790> ends<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.840> get<00:03:14.989> rid<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.260> those<00:03:15.940> spikes<00:03:16.940> you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
the ends to get rid of those spikes you

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.250 
the ends to get rid of those spikes you
don't<00:03:18.110> want<00:03:18.260> those<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.720> just

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
don't want those and what I do is I just

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.380 
don't want those and what I do is I just
each<00:03:21.410> time<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.830> trim<00:03:22.100> one<00:03:22.310> move<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.000> over<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.299> the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
each time I trim one move it over to the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.890 
each time I trim one move it over to the
other<00:03:23.510> side<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:24.980> know<00:03:25.480> which<00:03:26.480> ones<00:03:26.690> you've

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
other side so you know which ones you've

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.030 
other side so you know which ones you've
done<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:28.160> then<00:03:28.370> once<00:03:28.549> you've<00:03:28.790> done<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:30.040> you

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
done and then once you've done that you

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.540 
done and then once you've done that you
can<00:03:31.190> just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
can just

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.790 
can just
arrange<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.780> wires

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.860 

so<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.610> they're<00:03:42.790> all<00:03:42.940> facing<00:03:43.390> forwards

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
so that they're all facing forwards

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.210 
so that they're all facing forwards
because<00:03:44.340> when<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.460> put<00:03:45.640> your<00:03:45.760> comb<00:03:46.060> in<00:03:47.220> you

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
because when you put your comb in you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.730 
because when you put your comb in you
don't<00:03:48.400> put<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.670> in<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.970> way<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.650> the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
don't put it in this way it's the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.320 
don't put it in this way it's the
opposite<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.490> way<00:03:51.580> you<00:03:51.640> think<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.120> going

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
opposite to the way you think it's going

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.820 
opposite to the way you think it's going
to<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.780> actually<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.200> lift<00:03:53.410> your<00:03:53.590> hair<00:03:53.800> up

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
to be you actually you lift your hair up

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.450 
to be you actually you lift your hair up
and<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:55.300> sweep<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.990> up<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.380> then<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.250> push<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
and you sweep it up and then you push it

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.540 
and you sweep it up and then you push it
forwards<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.600> you've<00:03:58.750> got<00:03:59.020> your<00:03:59.140> fan<00:03:59.410> of<00:04:00.250> wires

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
forwards so you've got your fan of wires

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.000 
forwards so you've got your fan of wires
and<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.440> how<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.650> make<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.250> beaded<00:04:03.640> comb
