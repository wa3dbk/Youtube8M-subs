at<00:01:15.979> Concordia<00:01:16.520> University<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.180> the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
at Concordia University and the

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.240 
at Concordia University and the
animation<00:01:17.720> school<00:01:17.960> there<00:01:18.200> there<00:01:19.130> was<00:01:19.220> just

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
animation school there there was just

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.499 
animation school there there was just
something<00:01:19.520> like<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.000> know<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.150> was<00:01:20.330> like

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
something like you know I was like

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.350 
something like you know I was like
suddenly<00:01:21.259> all<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.500> pieces<00:01:21.710> came<00:01:22.070> together

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
suddenly all the pieces came together

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.390 
suddenly all the pieces came together
the<00:01:23.360> great<00:01:23.600> thing<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.049> think<00:01:24.350> about<00:01:24.680> animation

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
the great thing I think about animation

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.910 
the great thing I think about animation
and<00:01:25.759> maybe<00:01:26.240> especially<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:27.439> short<00:01:27.680> film

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and maybe especially the short film

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.210 
and maybe especially the short film
which<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:28.939> can<00:01:29.119> do<00:01:29.299> these<00:01:29.960> small<00:01:30.170> teams<00:01:30.560> or<00:01:30.890> by

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
which you can do these small teams or by

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.800 
which you can do these small teams or by
yourself<00:01:31.579> is<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.850> very<00:01:32.090> close<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.420> what

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
yourself is that you very close to what

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.630 
yourself is that you very close to what
you're<00:01:32.960> doing<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:34.299> it's<00:01:35.299> something<00:01:35.720> about<00:01:35.900> us

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
you're doing and it's something about us

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.660 
you're doing and it's something about us
being<00:01:37.810> controlling<00:01:38.810> or<00:01:39.079> not<00:01:40.040> wanting<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.400> let

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
being controlling or not wanting to let

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.219 
being controlling or not wanting to let
other<00:01:40.939> people<00:01:41.240> do<00:01:41.390> things<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.049> but<00:01:42.200> I

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
other people do things for you but I

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.810 
other people do things for you but I
don't<00:01:42.439> think<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.490> it's<00:01:43.610> just

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
don't think it's that I think it's just

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.730 
don't think it's that I think it's just
more<00:01:44.000> about<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.420> or<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.659> closeness<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.409> what

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
more about it or the closeness to what

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.340 
more about it or the closeness to what
you're<00:01:45.890> making<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.869> realized<00:01:48.200> in

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
you're making and and I realized in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.569 
you're making and and I realized in
animation<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.890> know<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.189> can<00:01:49.310> write<00:01:49.430> your

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
animation you know you can write your

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.249 
animation you know you can write your
own<00:01:49.640> stories<00:01:50.090> make<00:01:50.329> up<00:01:50.479> your<00:01:50.630> own<00:01:50.659> characters

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
own stories make up your own characters

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.270

and<00:01:51.700> draw<00:01:52.700> them<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.210> move<00:01:53.479> them<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.409> just

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and draw them and move them and I just

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.050 
and draw them and move them and I just
found<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.729> immediately<00:01:56.659> very<00:01:57.229> exciting<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.060> I

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
found it immediately very exciting and I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.850 
found it immediately very exciting and I
just<00:01:59.360> kind<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.930> was<00:02:00.049> a<00:02:00.079> bit<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.469> Eureka

just kind of it was a bit of a Eureka

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.140 
just kind of it was a bit of a Eureka
moment<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:02.829> still<00:02:03.829> feel<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.070> way

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150

seven years old and it relates a lot to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.700 
seven years old and it relates a lot to
my<00:05:01.770> family<00:05:01.939> they're<00:05:02.939> all<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.300> story<00:05:03.710> the

my family they're all in the story the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.339 
my family they're all in the story the

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
theme is this sense that I think a lot

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.550 
theme is this sense that I think a lot
of<00:05:07.379> kids<00:05:07.680> have<00:05:08.060> whether<00:05:09.060> it's<00:05:09.469> warranted<00:05:10.469> or

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
of kids have whether it's warranted or

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.110 
of kids have whether it's warranted or
not<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:11.750> they<00:05:12.750> feel<00:05:13.340> kind<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.490> alienated

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
not that they feel kind of alienated

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.450 
not that they feel kind of alienated
from<00:05:15.479> their<00:05:16.319> surroundings<00:05:17.039> but<00:05:17.279> there's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
from their surroundings but there's

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.230 
from their surroundings but there's
always<00:05:17.699> some<00:05:18.180> reason<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.569> feel<00:05:18.719> different<00:05:19.409> my

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
always some reason to feel different my

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.980 
always some reason to feel different my
parents<00:05:21.240> were<00:05:21.569> very<00:05:22.490> preoccupied<00:05:23.490> with<00:05:23.990> not

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
parents were very preoccupied with not

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.279 
parents were very preoccupied with not
fitting<00:05:25.439> in<00:05:25.729> being<00:05:26.729> different<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.479> thinking

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
fitting in being different and thinking

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.200 
fitting in being different and thinking
of<00:05:28.439> things<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:29.069> know<00:05:29.189> Fresh<00:05:29.520> Direct<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:30.090> all

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.420 
of things you know Fresh Direct and all
that<00:05:30.419> so<00:05:31.110> that's<00:05:31.229> kind<00:05:31.529> of<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.740> theme<00:05:32.009> about

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
that so that's kind of the theme about

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.089 
that so that's kind of the theme about
feeling<00:05:33.360> different<00:05:33.949> feeling<00:05:34.949> a<00:05:34.979> little

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
feeling different feeling a little

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.219 
feeling different feeling a little
alienated<00:05:35.939> from<00:05:36.090> your<00:05:36.300> family<00:05:36.779> because<00:05:37.080> of

alienated from your family because of

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.029 
alienated from your family because of
these<00:05:37.349> things<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:38.569> about<00:05:39.680> having<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.740> bit<00:05:40.889> of<00:05:40.919> a

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
these things and about having a bit of a

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.830 
these things and about having a bit of a
gap<00:05:41.310> between<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:42.150> parents<00:05:42.599> of<00:05:42.719> the<00:05:42.810> kids

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
gap between the parents of the kids

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.790 
gap between the parents of the kids
between<00:05:43.729> what<00:05:44.729> they<00:05:45.379> really<00:05:46.379> want

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
between what they really want

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.969 
between what they really want
but<00:05:46.979> perhaps<00:05:47.190> can't<00:05:47.610> really<00:05:47.909> express<00:05:48.979> what

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
but perhaps can't really express what

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.559 
but perhaps can't really express what
they<00:05:50.129> really<00:05:50.400> want<00:05:50.610> from<00:05:50.669> their<00:05:50.940> parents<00:05:51.389> and

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
they really want from their parents and

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.719 
they really want from their parents and
what<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:52.379> parents<00:05:52.860> are<00:05:52.979> very<00:05:53.129> focused<00:05:53.639> on

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
what the parents are very focused on

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.909 
what the parents are very focused on
giving<00:05:53.969> and<00:05:54.389> sometimes<00:05:54.810> they're<00:05:55.080> not<00:05:55.110> they

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
giving and sometimes they're not they

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.790 
giving and sometimes they're not they
don't<00:05:55.949> they<00:05:56.669> don't<00:05:56.879> really<00:05:57.029> match<00:05:57.620> so<00:05:58.620> that's

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
don't they don't really match so that's

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.189 
don't they don't really match so that's
the<00:05:59.039> young<00:05:59.250> and<00:06:00.000> then<00:06:00.180> we<00:06:00.330> want<00:06:00.539> to<00:06:00.599> bicycle

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
the young and then we want to bicycle

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.480 
the young and then we want to bicycle
and<00:06:01.409> we<00:06:01.500> want<00:06:01.710> just<00:06:01.889> an<00:06:01.979> ordinary<00:06:02.159> bicycle

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
and we want just an ordinary bicycle

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.689 
and we want just an ordinary bicycle
when<00:06:02.940> we<00:06:03.060> get<00:06:03.210> something<00:06:03.449> really<00:06:03.750> weird

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
when we get something really weird

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.399 
when we get something really weird
the<00:06:05.699> idea<00:06:06.000> is<00:06:06.240> but<00:06:06.479> it's<00:06:06.690> supposed<00:06:07.169> to<00:06:07.229> be<00:06:07.379> a

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
the idea is but it's supposed to be a

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.369 
the idea is but it's supposed to be a
bit<00:06:07.560> of<00:06:07.650> a<00:06:07.710> period<00:06:08.039> piece<00:06:08.129> comes<00:06:09.020> 60s<00:06:10.020> modern

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
bit of a period piece comes 60s modern

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.559 
bit of a period piece comes 60s modern
you<00:06:10.710> know<00:06:10.740> mid-century<00:06:11.339> modern<00:06:11.849> piece<00:06:12.240> I

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
you know mid-century modern piece I

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.499 
you know mid-century modern piece I
think<00:06:13.469> it'll<00:06:13.740> fit<00:06:14.099> well<00:06:14.400> with<00:06:14.639> a<00:06:14.669> to<00:06:14.939> other<00:06:15.180> and

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
think it'll fit well with a to other and

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.390 
think it'll fit well with a to other and
to<00:06:15.960> other<00:06:16.169> films<00:06:16.379> and<00:06:16.620> I<00:06:16.740> think<00:06:16.949> I<00:06:16.979> think<00:06:17.279> it

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
to other films and I think I think it

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.140 
to other films and I think I think it
might<00:06:17.550> even<00:06:17.699> work<00:06:17.879> as<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:18.210> package<00:06:18.779> actually<00:06:19.289> no

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
might even work as a package actually no

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.670 
might even work as a package actually no
trilogy<00:06:21.150> you<00:06:21.539> know<00:06:21.810> when<00:06:21.960> I<00:06:21.990> started<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.650> I

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
trilogy you know when I started it I

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.100 
trilogy you know when I started it I
thought<00:06:23.039> well<00:06:23.250> I<00:06:23.279> draw<00:06:23.819> that's<00:06:24.210> what<00:06:24.449> I<00:06:24.479> do<00:06:24.599> and

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
thought well I draw that's what I do and

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.429 
thought well I draw that's what I do and
so<00:06:25.680> this<00:06:25.830> is<00:06:25.949> what<00:06:26.099> I<00:06:26.129> will<00:06:26.370> do<00:06:26.520> and<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.810> then

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:28.439 
so this is what I will do and and then

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.550 
so this is what I will do and and then
at<00:06:28.529> the<00:06:28.589> same<00:06:28.800> time<00:06:29.039> I<00:06:29.490> feel<00:06:29.969> a<00:06:30.000> little<00:06:30.560> silly

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
at the same time I feel a little silly

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.100 
at the same time I feel a little silly
for<00:06:31.740> not<00:06:32.550> taking<00:06:32.759> advantage<00:06:33.240> of<00:06:33.689> all<00:06:33.900> these

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
for not taking advantage of all these

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.459 
for not taking advantage of all these
other<00:06:34.650> ways<00:06:35.189> but<00:06:35.699> you<00:06:35.939> can<00:06:36.120> do<00:06:36.479> it<00:06:36.629> these<00:06:36.810> days

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
other ways but you can do it these days

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.860 
other ways but you can do it these days
you<00:06:37.560> know<00:06:37.680> but<00:06:38.039> for<00:06:38.789> this<00:06:38.939> particular<00:06:39.240> story<00:06:39.779> I

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
you know but for this particular story I

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.679 
you know but for this particular story I
didn't<00:06:40.139> really<00:06:40.319> think<00:06:40.349> it

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
didn't really think it

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
didn't really think it
necessary<00:06:41.379> I<00:06:41.709> mean<00:06:42.339> I<00:06:42.369> did<00:06:42.729> consider<00:06:42.939> briefly

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:43.709 
necessary I mean I did consider briefly

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.759 
necessary I mean I did consider briefly
to<00:06:44.819> maybe<00:06:45.819> making<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.449> more<00:06:46.629> about<00:06:46.959> collage

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:47.769 
to maybe making it more about collage

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:51.059 
to maybe making it more about collage
style<00:06:48.459> film<00:06:49.329> but<00:06:49.809> I<00:06:50.049> couldn't<00:06:50.559> really<00:06:50.709> make<00:06:51.039> it

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
style film but I couldn't really make it

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.100 
style film but I couldn't really make it
work<00:06:51.399> with<00:06:52.209> the<00:06:52.299> characters<00:06:52.719> that<00:06:52.839> I<00:06:52.959> had

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
work with the characters that I had

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.869 
work with the characters that I had
designed<00:06:53.229> and<00:06:53.860> what<00:06:54.249> I<00:06:54.279> had<00:06:54.459> thought<00:06:54.489> for

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 
designed and what I had thought for

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.139 
designed and what I had thought for
backgrounds<00:06:55.419> and<00:06:55.539> everything<00:06:55.629> so<00:06:56.169> it's<00:06:56.349> some

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:57.149 
backgrounds and everything so it's some

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:01.079 
backgrounds and everything so it's some
so<00:06:58.149> I'm<00:06:58.360> kind<00:06:58.659> of<00:06:58.719> sort<00:06:59.289> of<00:06:59.439> in-between<00:07:00.089> having

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089 
so I'm kind of sort of in-between having

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:05.269 
so I'm kind of sort of in-between having
this<00:07:01.239> as<00:07:01.449> a<00:07:01.479> sort<00:07:01.749> of<00:07:02.279> deliberate<00:07:03.279> choice<00:07:03.699> and

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:05.279 
this as a sort of deliberate choice and

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.559 
this as a sort of deliberate choice and
really<00:07:06.279> just<00:07:06.429> doing<00:07:06.819> it<00:07:06.969> because<00:07:07.239> that's<00:07:07.449> the

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:07.569 
really just doing it because that's the

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.139 
really just doing it because that's the
way<00:07:07.749> that<00:07:08.169> I<00:07:08.289> do<00:07:08.349> it<00:07:08.499> I<00:07:08.799> would<00:07:09.279> like<00:07:09.489> to<00:07:09.759> try

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:10.149 
way that I do it I would like to try

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:12.329 
way that I do it I would like to try
something<00:07:10.629> different<00:07:10.659> because<00:07:11.379> a<00:07:11.829> lot<00:07:12.099> of<00:07:12.129> it

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:12.339 
something different because a lot of it

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:13.889 
something different because a lot of it
really<00:07:12.489> looks<00:07:12.789> like<00:07:12.849> fun

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:13.899 
really looks like fun

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:15.629 
really looks like fun
but<00:07:14.319> I<00:07:14.349> think<00:07:14.649> I<00:07:14.739> have<00:07:14.919> to<00:07:15.039> do<00:07:15.219> that<00:07:15.369> in<00:07:15.550> the

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 
but I think I have to do that in the

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.239 
but I think I have to do that in the
context<00:07:16.149> of<00:07:16.269> just<00:07:16.449> trying<00:07:17.379> out<00:07:17.559> things<00:07:17.889> and

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:18.249 
context of just trying out things and

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:21.049 
context of just trying out things and
maybe<00:07:18.459> not<00:07:19.319> experimenting<00:07:20.319> with<00:07:20.499> it<00:07:20.619> on<00:07:20.769> a

00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:21.059 
maybe not experimenting with it on a

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:23.850 
maybe not experimenting with it on a
story<00:07:22.059> that<00:07:22.119> I<00:07:22.329> have<00:07:22.629> other<00:07:22.749> plans<00:07:23.050> for<00:07:23.259> to<00:07:23.709> put

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
story that I have other plans for to put

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.159 
story that I have other plans for to put
it<00:07:23.979> that<00:07:24.099> way
