00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
because neither of them were standing up

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.259 
because neither of them were standing up
because<00:03:01.470> they<00:03:01.799> all<00:03:01.950> crushed<00:03:02.340> they<00:03:03.090> both

because they all crushed they both
crushed<00:03:03.840> foolia<00:03:04.349> stage<00:03:04.650> basically<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
crushed foolia stage basically that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.509 
crushed foolia stage basically that
caused<00:03:05.700> Cena<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.360> retain<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.620> title<00:03:08.190> but

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
caused Cena to retain the title but

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.839 
caused Cena to retain the title but
Ryback<00:03:09.120> was<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.989> close<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.290> be<00:03:10.590> seizing<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
debris title for himself but basically

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.560 
debris title for himself but basically
probably<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.480> might<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.690> another<00:03:16.680> match

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570
