that's just for music we also have

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.270 
that's just for music we also have
transitions<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.110> we<00:05:43.140> have<00:05:43.380> cube<00:05:43.740> dissolve

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
transitions and we have cube dissolve

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.400 
transitions and we have cube dissolve
ripple<00:05:44.970> wipe<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:45.690> origami

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
ripple wipe and origami

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.800 
ripple wipe and origami
let's<00:05:46.830> pick<00:05:47.040> origami<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:48.210> start<00:05:48.660> the

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
let's pick origami and start the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.180 
let's pick origami and start the
slideshow<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.940> there<00:05:51.210> we<00:05:51.360> go<00:05:52.190> beautiful

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
slideshow and there we go beautiful

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.430 
slideshow and there we go beautiful
pictures<00:05:53.910> and<00:05:54.210> it<00:05:54.510> will<00:05:54.630> do<00:05:54.750> some<00:05:54.930> really<00:05:55.200> nice

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
pictures and it will do some really nice

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.440 
pictures and it will do some really nice
transitions<00:05:56.130> we'll<00:05:56.310> wait<00:05:56.460> for<00:05:56.669> it<00:05:56.820> we'll<00:05:57.300> play

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
transitions we'll wait for it we'll play

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.520 
transitions we'll wait for it we'll play
music<00:05:58.910> while<00:05:59.910> it's<00:06:00.120> going<00:06:00.270> through<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.810> and

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
music while it's going through this and

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.490 
music while it's going through this and
it<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:02.400> unfolds<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.720> that's<00:06:04.050> why<00:06:04.200> they<00:06:04.320> call

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
it just unfolds and that's why they call

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.340 
it just unfolds and that's why they call
it<00:06:04.530> origami<00:06:05.010> we<00:06:05.580> can<00:06:05.730> take<00:06:05.940> a<00:06:05.970> look<00:06:06.210> at<00:06:06.419> maybe

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
it origami we can take a look at maybe

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.310 
it origami we can take a look at maybe
another<00:06:07.710> transition<00:06:08.600> let's<00:06:09.600> take<00:06:09.810> a<00:06:09.840> look<00:06:10.110> at

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
another transition let's take a look at

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.740 
another transition let's take a look at
I<00:06:10.590> guess<00:06:11.040> cube<00:06:11.430> which<00:06:11.730> is<00:06:11.880> that<00:06:12.240> most<00:06:12.450> of<00:06:12.630> these

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
I guess cube which is that most of these

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.810 
I guess cube which is that most of these
are<00:06:12.900> pretty<00:06:13.020> self-explanatory<00:06:13.610> but<00:06:14.610> let's

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
are pretty self-explanatory but let's

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.270 
are pretty self-explanatory but let's
take<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.030> look<00:06:15.240> at<00:06:15.360> them<00:06:15.570> anyway<00:06:16.010> there<00:06:17.010> you<00:06:17.040> go

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
take a look at them anyway there you go

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.360 
take a look at them anyway there you go
there's<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.580> new<00:06:18.030> Bugatti<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:19.280> again<00:06:20.280> it

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
there's the new Bugatti and again it

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.159 
there's the new Bugatti and again it
just<00:06:20.550> turns<00:06:20.880> and<00:06:21.240> that's<00:06:21.419> that's<00:06:21.750> really<00:06:21.960> all

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
just turns and that's that's really all

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.480 
just turns and that's that's really all
it<00:06:22.200> is<00:06:22.410> very<00:06:22.620> nice<00:06:23.750> looks<00:06:24.750> really<00:06:25.140> nice<00:06:25.490> and

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
it is very nice looks really nice and

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.260 
it is very nice looks really nice and
again<00:06:26.910> we<00:06:27.030> can<00:06:27.150> play<00:06:27.360> music<00:06:27.780> with<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:29.240> due<00:06:30.240> to

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
again we can play music with that due to

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.790 
again we can play music with that due to
copyright<00:06:30.570> things<00:06:31.169> I'm<00:06:31.289> not<00:06:31.410> going<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:31.650> play

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
copyright things I'm not going to play

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.440 
copyright things I'm not going to play
that<00:06:32.039> right<00:06:32.250> now<00:06:32.430> but<00:06:32.700> just<00:06:32.729> thought<00:06:33.030> I'd<00:06:33.180> show

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
that right now but just thought I'd show

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.780 
that right now but just thought I'd show
you<00:06:33.479> that<00:06:33.750> also

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
you that also

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.460 
you that also
that's<00:06:35.970> pretty<00:06:36.240> much<00:06:36.420> it<00:06:36.480> for<00:06:36.810> photos<00:06:37.230> but

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
that's pretty much it for photos but

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.340 
that's pretty much it for photos but
also<00:06:38.160> if<00:06:38.400> you<00:06:38.760> shut<00:06:39.000> this<00:06:39.150> off<00:06:39.360> say<00:06:40.020> you've<00:06:40.170> got

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
also if you shut this off say you've got

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.950 
also if you shut this off say you've got
it<00:06:40.470> in<00:06:40.560> your<00:06:40.680> dock<00:06:40.970> tilt<00:06:41.970> it<00:06:42.120> upright<00:06:42.450> sitting

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
it in your dock tilt it upright sitting

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.000 
it in your dock tilt it upright sitting

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
in the dock like this

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.950 
in the dock like this
if<00:06:44.130> we<00:06:44.310> hit<00:06:44.400> the<00:06:44.550> power<00:06:44.730> button<00:06:44.880> we<00:06:45.600> have<00:06:45.810> to

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
if we hit the power button we have to

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.110 
if we hit the power button we have to
screen<00:06:46.320> show<00:06:46.590> or<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:46.980> slideshow<00:06:47.490> option<00:06:47.640> here

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
screen show or the slideshow option here

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.810 
screen show or the slideshow option here
we<00:06:48.750> hit<00:06:48.900> that<00:06:49.080> it<00:06:49.830> automatically<00:06:50.370> goes<00:06:50.580> into

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
we hit that it automatically goes into

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.910 
we hit that it automatically goes into
the<00:06:50.970> slideshow<00:06:51.210> and<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:52.170> stays<00:06:52.440> in<00:06:52.620> the<00:06:52.710> dock

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
the slideshow and it stays in the dock

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.040
