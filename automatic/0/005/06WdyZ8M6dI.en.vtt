00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.299
 halo film forget and nice that you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.879
 Join the film radio again 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.320
 the westerns felled by sergio leone 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.360
 I usually extremely well 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.850
 but even if it is probably his biggest 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.710
 work so you know now play me 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.800
 the song of death is an italo western 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 by sergio leone from the year 1968 in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 the center of the story is john mccain 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.550
 mother monika frank and talent 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170
 it's about greed and, above all, revenge 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.899
 play me the song of death is one 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.520
 really thick brummer leone has here 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.320
 for the first time for a western one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.269
 really big budget from hollywood 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 and you can see that in the 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.819
 compared to his dollar trilogy too 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.620
 very strong 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.239
 alone the opening scene with the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.460
 many sounds are already 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 so good that you just disbelieve with that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.429
 can shake his head 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 more generally, the film already s.einem 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.179
 modern opera every character has one 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.100
 own signature tune and especially the 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.889
 by Charles Bronson and Claudia 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 Cardinals are incredibly good where I am too 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.489
 directly back to the next point 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 the again mad great soundtrack 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.690
 So everything sounds from ennio morricone 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.340
 ever really great 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.740
 but I have something too 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 criticize the story is interesting 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.710
 and also the tourist in things 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 harmonica and francs field very 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.789
 however i find this western from 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 Leone too polished and too much on 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.509
 highly polished trimmed what certainly with 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 related to the big budget 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.409
 then there's charles bronson who is 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.270
 here also the nameless hero in 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 quotes but has mine 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.969
 opinion after a long time not the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.649
 effect of clint eastwood 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.810
 In that sense, this is really one 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.390
 insanely great movie already like one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 painting of salvador dalÃ­ works 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.380
 somehow really good 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.719
 somehow it's something lazy and it too 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.850
 does not agree with everything 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.250
 I found the film a bit lengthy 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.039
 Nevertheless, the song of death is playing for me 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.590
 already a piece of cultural heritage easy 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.140
 Everybody should have seen the for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.659
 but me not long belted en 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.909
 dag iran play me the song of 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.490
 death lasts 175 minutes currently at 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.950
 nearly 137 thousand reviews on her 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.310
 debut an average rating of 87 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.319
 I go lower one 85 points 85 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.330
 now to you how did you find the film 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.410
 agrees with him because I post it out 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.210
 your opinion 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.590
 We then went to the next film 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.590
 again and until then, I say
