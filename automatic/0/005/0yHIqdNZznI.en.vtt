about<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.829> company<00:00:52.160> for<00:00:52.310> what<00:00:52.399> you<00:00:52.520> works<00:00:52.790> and

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
about the company for what you works and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.090 
about the company for what you works and
I<00:00:53.090> mean<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.270> think<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:54.110> their<00:00:54.320> record<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.829> this

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
I mean I think that their record to this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.430 
I mean I think that their record to this
point<00:00:55.370> speaks<00:00:55.820> pretty<00:00:56.030> pretty<00:00:56.480> highly<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
point speaks pretty pretty highly of the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.500 
point speaks pretty pretty highly of the
game<00:00:57.680> changers<00:00:58.160> that<00:00:58.340> they've<00:00:58.520> introduced<00:00:59.360> to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
game changers that they've introduced to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.240 
game changers that they've introduced to
us<00:00:59.540> so<00:00:59.780> far<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.500> think<00:01:00.739> that's<00:01:00.950> been<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.190> big

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
us so far so I think that's been a big

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.590 
us so far so I think that's been a big
question<00:01:01.700> for<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:01.850> long<00:01:02.000> time<00:01:02.210> here<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:02.510> we've

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
question for a long time here so we've

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.700 
question for a long time here so we've
all<00:01:02.720> been<00:01:02.809> talking<00:01:02.930> about<00:01:03.140> how<00:01:03.230> cheap<00:01:03.500> apple

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
stock is and you know again I think they

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.600

have<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.259> reiterate<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.740> they're<00:01:07.070> not<00:01:07.250> just

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
definitely said the wrist was what was

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.859 
definitely said the wrist was what was
the<00:01:34.070> area<00:01:34.250> they<00:01:34.460> were<00:01:34.520> targeting<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.450> know<00:01:35.570> it

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
the area they were targeting you know it

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.420 
the area they were targeting you know it
was<00:01:35.990> kind<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.200> odd<00:01:36.380> though<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.710> say<00:01:37.280> that

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
was kind of odd though to say that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.940 
was kind of odd though to say that
people<00:01:37.549> who<00:01:37.700> don't<00:01:37.850> need<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.090> wear<00:01:38.180> glasses

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
people who don't need to wear glasses

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.140 
people who don't need to wear glasses
won't<00:01:39.950> wear<00:01:40.159> glasses<00:01:40.369> because<00:01:40.549> I<00:01:40.880> really

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
won't wear glasses because I really

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
fact but as Jason said maybe they're

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.080

relatively<00:03:09.120> new<00:03:09.330> player<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> market<00:03:10.260> you

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
relatively new player to the market you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.480 
relatively new player to the market you
know<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> think<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.890> concern<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.370> take

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
know I think the concern that I take

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.440 
know I think the concern that I take
away<00:03:11.640> from<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.270> they<00:03:12.330> actually

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
away from it was that they actually

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.930 
away from it was that they actually
missed<00:03:12.900> estimates<00:03:13.080> on<00:03:13.500> sales<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.220> mean<00:03:14.610> anyone

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
missed estimates on sales I mean anyone

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.430 
missed estimates on sales I mean anyone
can<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.240> manufacture<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.110> earnings

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
can really manufacture the earnings

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.260 
can really manufacture the earnings
number<00:03:16.680> chris<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.310> sales<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.060> matter

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
number chris it's the sales and matter

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.970 
number chris it's the sales and matter
right<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:19.170> i<00:03:19.200> mean<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.680> will<00:03:19.800> get<00:03:19.890> this

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
right but i mean you will get this

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.170 
right but i mean you will get this
compared<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.340> something<00:03:20.490> like<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.700> whole<00:03:20.910> foods

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
compared to something like a whole foods

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.940 
compared to something like a whole foods
for<00:03:21.330> example<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.930> fresh<00:03:22.440> market<00:03:22.740> has<00:03:22.830> about

for example so fresh market has about

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.010 
for example so fresh market has about
131<00:03:23.730> stores<00:03:24.000> open<00:03:24.360> right<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:24.540> compared<00:03:24.990> to

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
131 stores open right now compared to

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.220 
131 stores open right now compared to
whole<00:03:25.230> foods<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.040> 300<00:03:26.520> plus<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:28.080> is

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
whole foods you know 300 plus this is

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.840 
whole foods you know 300 plus this is
just<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.500> razor<00:03:28.740> thin<00:03:29.070> margin<00:03:29.430> game<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.730> begin

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
just a razor thin margin game to begin

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
just a razor thin margin game to begin
with<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.240> i<00:03:30.270> liked<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.810> company<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:31.410> if

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
with so i liked the company I think if

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.840 
with so i liked the company I think if
you're<00:03:31.560> gonna<00:03:31.650> play<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:32.070> space<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.610> gotta

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
you're gonna play this space you gotta

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.250 
you're gonna play this space you gotta
go<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.270> big<00:03:33.480> dog<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.720> something<00:03:34.140> like<00:03:34.170> a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
go with a big dog and something like a

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.040 
go with a big dog and something like a
whole<00:03:34.470> foods<00:03:34.739> Trina<00:03:35.489> Solar<00:03:35.910> down<00:03:36.360> after<00:03:36.810> first

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
whole foods Trina Solar down after first

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.420 
whole foods Trina Solar down after first
quarter<00:03:37.320> revenue<00:03:37.620> came<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:37.950> lower<00:03:38.190> than

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
quarter revenue came in lower than

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430 
quarter revenue came in lower than
expected<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:39.150> Chinese<00:03:39.540> solar<00:03:39.810> company<00:03:40.230> also

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
expected the Chinese solar company also

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.130 
expected the Chinese solar company also
lost<00:03:40.890> more<00:03:41.310> money<00:03:41.489> than<00:03:42.180> predicted<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.110> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
lost more money than predicted this is a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.840 
lost more money than predicted this is a
pretty<00:03:43.530> tricky<00:03:43.950> space<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.489> think<00:03:44.730> about

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
pretty tricky space if you think about

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.910 
pretty tricky space if you think about
it<00:03:45.030> when<00:03:45.270> it<00:03:45.360> comes<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.570> solar<00:03:45.959> energy<00:03:46.560> yeah

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
it when it comes to solar energy yeah

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.040 
it when it comes to solar energy yeah
this<00:03:47.580> space<00:03:47.760> needs<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.120> rationalize<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> lot

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
this space needs to rationalize a lot

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.750 
this space needs to rationalize a lot
like<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> US<00:03:49.530> airline<00:03:49.860> industry<00:03:50.310> has<00:03:50.520> been

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
like the US airline industry has been

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.920 
like the US airline industry has been
doing<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> mean<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.180> thing<00:03:51.330> about<00:03:51.450> Trina<00:03:51.690> Solar

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
doing I mean the thing about Trina Solar

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.190 
doing I mean the thing about Trina Solar
was<00:03:52.200> volume<00:03:52.620> sales<00:03:53.190> volume<00:03:53.820> was<00:03:54.060> up<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
was volume sales volume was up but you

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.290 
was volume sales volume was up but you
know<00:03:55.290> sales<00:03:55.650> numbered<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.820> know<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.030> dollar

know sales numbered you know the dollar
net<00:03:57.540> was<00:03:57.660> down<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:58.080> prices<00:03:58.410> are

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
net was down because prices are

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.050 
net was down because prices are
following<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.100> much<00:03:59.250> when<00:03:59.459> volumes<00:03:59.820> are<00:03:59.970> up

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
following so much when volumes are up

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.449 
following so much when volumes are up
and<00:04:00.239> prices<00:04:00.540> are<00:04:00.660> down<00:04:00.870> you've<00:04:01.560> got<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.739> supply

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
and prices are down you've got a supply

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.800 
and prices are down you've got a supply
demand<00:04:02.610> problem<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.209> needs<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.450> be<00:04:03.540> solved

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
demand problem that needs to be solved

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
compress a little bit because the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.970 
compress a little bit because the
pricing<00:04:29.820> power<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.330> diminishes<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.740> still

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
pricing power is it diminishes but still

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.440 
pricing power is it diminishes but still
this<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.520> biggest<00:04:32.730> player<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.360> game

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
this is the biggest player in this game

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.420 
this is the biggest player in this game
by<00:04:33.750> factor<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.140> better<00:04:34.290> than<00:04:34.470> two<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.980> so

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
by factor of better than two and so

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.610
