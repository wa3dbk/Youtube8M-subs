00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.800
 well the nice thing about macro photography is that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.470
 you indicate that to a very small level 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.570
 for example, you are going to photograph mosses 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.450
 with you can enjoy it immensely 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.910
