Tamara Rodriguez stay here ready for the
next<00:00:02.220> step<00:00:02.460> we're<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.820> define<00:00:02.970> their

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
next step we're going to define their

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.570 
next step we're going to define their
highlights<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.380> redefine<00:00:04.920> our<00:00:05.100> hot<00:00:05.220> spots

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
highlights and redefine our hot spots

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.519 
highlights and redefine our hot spots
let's<00:00:05.970> get<00:00:06.120> down<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.600> right<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.350> got

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
let's get down to it right now we got

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.549 
let's get down to it right now we got
the<00:00:07.560> Badger<00:00:07.890> Vega<00:00:08.250> 2000<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.530> to

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the Badger Vega 2000 and we're going to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.560 
the Badger Vega 2000 and we're going to
come<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.490> Vega<00:00:11.730> number<00:00:12.120> three<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
come in with this Vega number three and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.660 
come in with this Vega number three and
we're<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> come<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.469> just<00:00:13.670> redefine

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
we're going to come in and just redefine

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.510 
we're going to come in and just redefine
our<00:00:14.849> hot<00:00:15.210> spots<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.630> all<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> highlights

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
our hot spots and all the highlights

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.010 
our hot spots and all the highlights
that<00:00:17.520> are<00:00:17.670> key<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.060> making<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.390> fire<00:00:18.750> look

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that are key to making this fire look

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.779 
that are key to making this fire look
like<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.740> realistic<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:22.160> what<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> did<00:00:23.340> here

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
like it's realistic so what I did here

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.419 
like it's realistic so what I did here
is<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:26.810> got<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:28.109> white<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.800> reduced<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
is I I got some white and I reduced to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.139 
is I I got some white and I reduced to
just<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:29.880> bit<00:00:31.399> with<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.430> water<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
just a little bit with some water and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.110 
just a little bit with some water and
some<00:00:33.329> Windex<00:00:34.399> really<00:00:35.399> doesn't<00:00:35.730> matter<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
some Windex really doesn't matter on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
some Windex really doesn't matter on the
mix<00:00:37.520> 5050<00:00:38.520> fine<00:00:39.230> then<00:00:40.230> we're<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> come

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
mix 5050 fine then we're going to come

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
mix 5050 fine then we're going to come
in<00:00:40.920> cut<00:00:41.190> through<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> middle<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.879> playing

in cut through the middle of playing

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.440 
in cut through the middle of playing
with<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> new<00:00:42.660> layer<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> flame<00:00:44.450> just

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
with the new layer of flame just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:01:19.210 
with the new layer of flame just
redefine<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.200> those<00:00:46.350> hot<00:00:46.530> spots

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.500 

again

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
again

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.660 
again
to<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.230> nice<00:01:22.560> clean<00:01:22.950> job<00:01:22.980> it's<00:01:23.460> very

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to do a nice clean job it's very

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.230 
to do a nice clean job it's very
important<00:01:24.120> to<00:01:24.150> study<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:25.650> anatomy<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
important to study the anatomy of a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870 
important to study the anatomy of a
plane<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> way<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.730> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
plane and the way you do that and just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.730 
plane and the way you do that and just
get<00:01:30.120> yourself<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.570> bunch<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.870> references<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
get yourself a bunch of references and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.220 
get yourself a bunch of references and
just<00:01:31.890> try<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.730> reproduce<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.690> much<00:01:34.050> as

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
just try to reproduce them as much as

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.650 
just try to reproduce them as much as
possible<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.940> that<00:01:36.120> will<00:01:36.270> give<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
possible and that will give you the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.370 
possible and that will give you the
ability<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.230> create<00:01:38.720> virtually<00:01:39.720> any<00:01:39.960> sort<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
ability to create virtually any sort of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
ability to create virtually any sort of
pattern<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.950> flame<00:01:41.510> just<00:01:42.510> because<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> now

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pattern of flame just because you now

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.420 
pattern of flame just because you now
understand<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.010> takes<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:45.600> create<00:01:45.900> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
understand what it takes to create a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.950 
understand what it takes to create a
plane<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.300> study<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> various

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
plane because you study the various

00:01:48.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
plane because you study the various
patterns<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.480> can<00:01:51.660> make

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.309 

so<00:02:06.670> our<00:02:06.790> flames<00:02:07.090> whipping<00:02:07.869> around<00:02:07.960> its

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
so our flames whipping around its

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.900 
so our flames whipping around its
rolling<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:12.400> sure<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.880> that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
rolling want to make sure we have that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.170 
rolling want to make sure we have that
movie<00:02:13.300> going<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.640> one's<00:02:15.850> coming

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
movie going on here so this one's coming

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
movie going on here so this one's coming
up<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.450> flicking<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.840> want<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.080> make

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
up and flicking out you want to make

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:32.550 
up and flicking out you want to make
sure<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.890> makes<00:02:21.130> sense<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.730> this

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.100 

this<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:33.799> here<00:02:33.950> kind<00:02:34.189> of<00:02:34.250> drops<00:02:34.579> down<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:36.019> it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
this one here kind of drops down and it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.920 
this one here kind of drops down and it
flicks<00:02:36.439> over<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.819> shoots<00:02:38.150> out<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.480> top<00:02:38.720> like

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
flicks over and shoots out the top like

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:55.540 
flicks over and shoots out the top like
that

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.740 

ok

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
ok

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.870 
ok
and<00:02:58.320> we're<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.680> redefining<00:02:59.280> all<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.730> hot

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and we're just redefining all the hot

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:22.449 
and we're just redefining all the hot
spots<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.390> more<00:03:00.540> time

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.500 

going<00:03:23.459> right<00:03:23.670> through<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.970> middle<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.390> our

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
going right through the middle of our

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.720 
going right through the middle of our
prior<00:03:25.290> hotspot<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.220> create<00:03:26.490> another<00:03:26.670> layer

prior hotspot to create another layer

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.309 
prior hotspot to create another layer
and<00:03:29.730> we're<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.090> creating<00:03:30.360> following<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
and we're just creating following the

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.730 
and we're just creating following the
movement<00:03:31.770> that<00:03:31.860> we<00:03:32.010> created<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.520> initial

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
movement that we created in the initial
