 Hello friends and subscribers today 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.620
 rented tutorial how to get things in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.020
 congo and getting almost nothing 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.210
 does as well if you are not a believer and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.820
 you don't believe all this nonsense you can 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 just a video for those who are interested 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.699
 can keep looking generally 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.920
 look click play play 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.850
 server search 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 communities here you are in the internet crap in 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:49.020
 Generally here is a tag and a debt like this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.539
 drive just and click update you 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 many different servers are updated i 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.780
 I advise you to choose a server where 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.609
 written on the sling yes that's where 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.539
 written late pavino 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.180
 I already have a server where there is always 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.670
 Well, not always, I generally only yesterday about 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.460
 I found out for this why I am now 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.760
 show here in general, go to 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.040
 This card is loaded pretty 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.750
 quickly because the card is small and in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.460
 In principle, there is nothing especially in it. 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 in general, that's when the map was loaded 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 click continue click goal and in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 In principle, nothing else needs to be done. 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.659
 you can just roll the game to play there to 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.229
 dota game with your anything can 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.420
 go for a walk go to sleep and you just 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.270
 will drop all things true fall out 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.380
 things will not be so straight 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.430
 clothes fell out 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.009
 and randomly there it turns out may not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.800
 may fall on today 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.340
 I gave the night like 1 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.980
 1 star cases are also possibly called 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.060
 different here achivki just a pack I kill 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.970
 these dudes 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.770
 they stand just as well and just wait for 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.350
 they will drop some clothes 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.810
 because this one is just real 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.740
 effective in my experience made sure 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.380
 what is it all effective it works 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.730
 so that those who will write 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.720
 comments it doesn't work 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.650
 just don't believe him myself it 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.190
 it works so just who doesn't believe 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.960
 just pass by and all there too 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.630
 Russian plays the principle of everything I am about it 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.940
 told also i don't know i said and not 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.700
 said here you can bet it achivki 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.310
 just killing enemies and basically 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 so this way we get very 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:56.720
 a lot of things just go out there for a walk 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.520
 or sleep go all done again 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.250
 let me show you what clothes I myself 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.520
 personally saw here in general and see here 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.060
