00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 or 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.110
 what is photosynthesis 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.449
 it's the chemical reaction that allows 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.449
 to push plants 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's the most 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.460
 abundant that occurs on the surface of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.410
 the land from very far away 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 I will also say that it is the most 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.080
 important if there was no 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.270
 photosynthesis 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.860
 there would be no plants there 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.670
 would have no animals and there would be 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670
 so no human beings 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 or 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.950
 for a plant to grow it takes 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.950
 water of mineral salts 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.010
 energy and carbon dioxide 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.750
 let's start with the energy it comes from 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.910
 Sun 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.830
 she arrives roughly at the vertical and 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.630
 so it's normal that a sheet this 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.870
 a horizontal structure since 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.170
 it's a solar collector like energy 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.930
 Solar is fairly low it takes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.480
 sensor standards that means it takes 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.740
 foliar surface standards a big 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.170
 tree like those who are above 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.150
 we are hundreds of hectares of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 surface hundreds of leaves 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.210
 ha 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.550
 obviously we can not move when we have 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.020
 this surface there so it's consistent 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.900
 with the fact that it is plants 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 still water they come from 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.310
 roots she climbs into the rod and she 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.750
 arrives by the tail of the leaf and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.959
 it is distributed in the network of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.420
 ribs and if we turn the leaf on 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.560
 see that it is less green 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.250
 on the other hand but there would be a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 microscope 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.990
 it is riddled with small holes by where 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.060
 enter the carbon dioxide 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.040
 Oh 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.870
 and thanks to the chlorophyll molecule 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.000
 who is in each cell of leaves 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.769
 and which is a green color pigment 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.719
 so that explains why the foliage 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.519
 green thanks to this molecule of 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:40.939
 chlorophyll carbon dioxide co2 is 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.129
 broken in two pieces knows it's at 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.290
 to say the carbon tome it is kept 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.709
 in the plant is the plant uses it 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.900
 to grow as to the o2 it is rejected 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.849
 in the atmosphere it emerges 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.069
 holes through which the gases enter the gas 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.019
 carbonic and that it suits us well 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.799
 because water 2 is really the gas 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.799
 we breathe 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 Oh 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.349
 so that's good for an organization 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.660
 to be photosynthetic because there's 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.360
 no need to move 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.830
 the sun will not be long in arriving there 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.750
 must arrange to not be in the shade 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.000
 here we are in an undergrowth so it's 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.880
 a bit difficult to have sun 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.920
 but if we think of a plant in a 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.380
 clear middle she does not need to 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.680
 move because the Latin sun 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.690
 directly the animals can not 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.870
 do that an animal that wants to feed 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.810
 he has to move precisely to 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.080
 get your food 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.080
 possibly hunting and the solution 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.930
 vegetable one way she is a lot 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.030
 More comfortable 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.459
 that's cold I meet like that of 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.640
 way maybe a little too simple of 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.940
 this prestigious reaction of the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.940
 photosynthesis 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.150
 but it's very important to understand 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.519
 that this kind of complementarity 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.549
 between animals the human being a 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.380
 apart from the plants of the other the water of 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.840
 the oxygen they produce us in 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.210
 we need 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.630
 all life on this planet depends on 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.630
 photosynthesis 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 1 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.370
 Yes
