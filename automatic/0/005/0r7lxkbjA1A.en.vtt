England because we work off September
birthdays<00:01:41.159> rather<00:01:41.520> than<00:01:41.820> January<00:01:42.450> birthdays

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.020 
birthdays rather than January birthdays
we<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.200> mixed<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.710> two<00:01:43.890> teams<00:01:44.100> together<00:01:44.310> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
we are mixed in two teams together so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
we are mixed in two teams together so
it's<00:01:45.149> quite<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.899> very<00:01:46.110> good<00:01:46.200> experience

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's quite it's a very good experience

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.929 
it's quite it's a very good experience
for<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.829> place<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> play<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.610> plays<00:01:47.820> they

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
for our place to play with plays they

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.030 
for our place to play with plays they
don't<00:01:48.090> normally<00:01:48.210> play<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.829> against<00:01:49.829> teams

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
don't normally play with against teams

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.200 
don't normally play with against teams
that<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.280> perhaps<00:01:50.399> more<00:01:50.670> used<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> playing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that are perhaps more used to playing

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.240 
that are perhaps more used to playing
together<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
together so that will put it with one of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.350 
together so that will put it with one of
the<00:01:53.340> main<00:01:53.460> differences<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.000> me<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the main differences for me but the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
the main differences for me but the
level<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.689> very<00:01:55.079> good<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.130> any<00:01:56.340> special

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
level is very good is there any special

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
level is very good is there any special
team<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> made<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> give<00:01:58.049> us<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
team that made you give us the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.580 
team that made you give us the
impression<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.189> you<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:01.140> really

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
impression on you not really

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.959 
impression on you not really
oh<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.460> every<00:02:02.640> team<00:02:02.820> has

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
oh not really I think every team has

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340 
oh not really I think every team has
been<00:02:03.119> being<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> good<00:02:03.719> standard<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.229> know

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
been being of a good standard you know

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.350 
been being of a good standard you know
so<00:02:04.560> again<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.369> don't<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> ages<00:02:06.299> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
so again it you don't know the ages of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
so again it you don't know the ages of
the<00:02:06.450> player<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.079> some<00:02:07.350> groups<00:02:07.770> may<00:02:07.920> bring

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the player so some groups may bring

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.100 
the player so some groups may bring
mainly<00:02:08.550> very<00:02:08.819> young<00:02:09.030> players<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.599> he's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
mainly very young players so he's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.449 
mainly very young players so he's
difficult<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.560> compare<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.280> thought

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
difficult to compare but I thought

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.039 
difficult to compare but I thought
I<00:02:12.489> felt<00:02:12.939> Legia<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.360> be<00:02:13.450> found<00:02:13.689> that<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
I felt Legia to be found that in the

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.839 
I felt Legia to be found that in the
last<00:02:14.260> game<00:02:14.439> there<00:02:14.680> we'd<00:02:15.159> already<00:02:15.310> qualified

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
last game there we'd already qualified

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.880 
last game there we'd already qualified
so<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.329> time<00:02:16.689> to<00:02:16.840> play<00:02:17.049> different<00:02:17.560> people<00:02:17.829> in

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
so we time to play different people in

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.380 
so we time to play different people in
different<00:02:17.920> positions<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.610> give<00:02:18.730> them<00:02:18.879> give

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
different positions that give them give

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.880 
different positions that give them give
them<00:02:19.510> more<00:02:19.659> playing<00:02:19.930> time<00:02:19.989> but<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.709> thought

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
them more playing time but I thought

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.259 
them more playing time but I thought
they<00:02:20.950> were<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:21.069> well-organized<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.000> until

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
they were very well-organized and until

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.550 
they were very well-organized and until
there<00:02:22.420> goes<00:02:22.540> well<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.170> was<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.290> good<00:02:23.409> game

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
there goes well so that was a good game

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.949 
there goes well so that was a good game
and<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.819> competition<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:25.329> general<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.780> the
