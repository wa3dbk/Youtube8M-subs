00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 I'm going to make cod meatballs and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.660
 sauce with prawns we need mirage 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 of well-separated cod we have them 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.620
 we also have salted 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.940
 salty in nothing in three or four hours 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.460
 we have some prawns an egg 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.070
 little almonds toasted parsley 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:36.310
 saffron looks at bread soaking milk 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.900
 peas bread grated onion wine 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:44.040
 white and flour fish fumet oil 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.040
 salt and garlic 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.790
 in a bowl we have put the crumbs 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.000
 cod well drained an egg one 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.010
 clove garlic , minced parsley and chopped 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 crumb of bread that we had soaking in 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.950
 drained milk now we're going to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.620
 mix well to form a 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.680
 Masita and let it rest a bit 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.020
 so that the flavors intermingled as 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 the dough is a little soft because it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.950
 we add bread crumbs 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.050
 let's add it a little bit in little 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 until we see that they can be formed 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.540
 okay the meatballs and it's not 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.310
 excessively soft 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.280
 so now let's remove the bread 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.300
 roll once it has rested a little 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.130
 dough 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.360
 let's go picking up with a spoon 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 lots and making little balls once 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.270
 we have the balls we will pass them by 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.450
 flour and fry them in a pan with 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.450
 hot oil until golden brown 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.410
 and this to the products lower them by 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.410
 flour 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.730
 all the walls 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.240
 in the quarries 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.159
 we have reserved the meatballs 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.369
 golden 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.580
 Now in another pan with clean oil 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:08.590
 so let's fry chopped onions 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.370
 so now once the oil is 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.100
 hot we will introduce it while it 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.250
 we fried the onion in another pan 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.480
 we put a little oil and here 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.700
 let's fry 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.150
 the heads and skins of 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.069
 we have peeled prawns but not 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.010
 we throw the heads and the skins 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.830
 let's fry in that oil and once 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.980
 that we have fried them we will incorporate 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.110
 added to the pan to take the flavor 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.020
 of these heads and bodies of prawns 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.900
 prawns forgiveness 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.710
 we are also in the mortar biting 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.230
 the toasted almonds peeled a tooth 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.240
 garlic and some parsley as 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.460
 we will get it right and then incorporate it into 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.940
 the sauce 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.220
 helping us with a spoon let's go 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.010
 tracing the heads so that they release their 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.230
 juice 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.129
 once we have it already well the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.129

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.530
 the peels with the juice and later what 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.530
 we will fly 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.920
 we already have onion fried now let's go 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:32.980
 to add half a teaspoon of flour 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.190
 let's sautÃ© to remove the flavor 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.780
 raw flour and then we're going to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:45.299
 strain the prawns stock and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.299
 I smoked that we had already prepared 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.790

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.790

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.069

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.540
 now we have finished the sauce well 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.260

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.260

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.730

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.130

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.760
