00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
the valleys so does that the lower

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so the opposites leeward said so they

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.910 
so the opposites leeward said so they
receive<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:45.570> rainfall<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.530> no<00:01:46.740> rain<00:01:46.799> for
