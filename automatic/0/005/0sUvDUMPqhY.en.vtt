00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.590
 When will the effect of reading come out? 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.110
 Psychiatric Medicine Path Fashion Hippo Channel 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:18.500
 Reading books I read many books but I do not need the effect 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:23.690
 I read a book but it enriches my life, business and things like that 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.610
 I do not Some people may think the Fu that Do I think we do not stand in so much role 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.789
 The effect of reading is that number 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.100
 And what appears 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:38.620
 I think that there are two appearances after quite a while 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:44.530
 To solve the problem that everyone's So you way of reading So now suffering in 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:50.050
 I think that there is one is that four in order to there now solve everyone's work on the issues 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.790
 But the other one is that other books and psychology books and such books are read soon after reading 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.860
 There is nothing that will change 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:01.880
 Read the how much the balance of people this is not there is immediately present and very much effect the effect is out 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:07.790
 It is too biased too much but you do you may be referred to as I go 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:11.690
 Read only gold of philosophy at the well immediately to the effect does not appear to effect out this of practical now now 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 That since there is no come grew up because essential part it is also not read just know-how 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.810
 Balance is one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.610
 I think that seems to 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.530
 When I something is or the story that went Science and Technology was a number of different jobs now 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 Of course, after all 10 years it's there is also a part that is chosen this summer source in recent months 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.280
 It is good to talk about the book before 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.320
 It has been working for quite some time now 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.880
 Or it is various experiences about ten years ago That kind of thing is finally now 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.630
 The fact that you are listening is that you are at the mercy of the content of the book you read at that time 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.640
 Really in the sense Tteyuu I can be applied to Fu say such things do's and or anti 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 With a wide spread People who produce a lot are connected with variously with a wide spread 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 It is emerging as an effect 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.829
 It feels like it for about 10 years 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.539
 So I think I'm going to deposit 10 years from now 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:04.530
 I think Fu say and not Ika stacked and wonder if does not come out splashes of say real effect 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:08.259
 Of course it is important to choose so that there is immediate effect, but such things also 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:13.269
 Even if you include it, really enrich your life 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.189
 What I read now or what I do not do is to enrich the future of you for 10 years 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.349
 It is quite the ultra-Kisen of whether come involved it is in or I'm so much 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:25.299
 I like this not think such a thing 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:28.280
 I have read a lot of different books, but now it is now and I read a lot 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:33.350
 So it seems Fu say really Do was good to be 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.430
 Saving money for the future Even if you save money, you know what the money will be in the future 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.050
 No is inflation 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.520
 It may be gone but 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.900
 But the knowledge that is stored like that in books is becoming more and more in us 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.320
 Well, it's bloated and it's growing like it's compound interest money. 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.210
 Life of everybody when it is five years ten years 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.069
 Than I think it is no doubt contribute is to enrich sleep ideas and humanity 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.620
 Looking ahead looking at 10 years What is it that you can do now? 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.620
 I think that there is reading as one of them 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:13.730
