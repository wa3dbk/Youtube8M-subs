should<00:02:04.299> be<00:02:04.509> enough<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.989> water<00:02:14.350> system

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
should be enough for the water system

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.900 
should be enough for the water system
and<00:02:15.579> so<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:15.940> must<00:02:16.150> know<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:18.190> make<00:02:18.370> water<00:02:18.579> on

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
and so we must know to make water on

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.319 
and so we must know to make water on

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.020 
time payload for these distances 20
tonnes<00:04:30.700> so<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:32.200> weight<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:32.740> cars<00:04:33.669> and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
tonnes so the weight of this cars and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.920 
tonnes so the weight of this cars and
all<00:04:34.810> Spears<00:04:35.590> it's<00:04:36.330> nothing<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.479> compare<00:04:37.870> with

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
all Spears it's nothing to compare with

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.800 
all Spears it's nothing to compare with
payload<00:04:39.030> as<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.270> understand<00:04:40.919> yeah<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.810> we're

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
payload as you understand yeah and we're

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.590 
payload as you understand yeah and we're
out<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.560> we<00:04:45.100> had<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.550> first<00:04:45.729> test<00:04:46.510> drive

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
out here and we had the first test drive

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.540 
out here and we had the first test drive
here<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:49.660> looks<00:04:49.960> very<00:04:50.229> very

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
here and it's it looks very very

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.740 
here and it's it looks very very
optimistic<00:04:51.550> because<00:04:51.870> we<00:04:52.950> negotiated<00:04:53.950> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
optimistic because we negotiated the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.510 
optimistic because we negotiated the
pretty<00:04:55.750> steep<00:04:56.050> slopes<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:57.479> blue<00:04:58.479> ice<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.520> the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
pretty steep slopes of blue ice and the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.080 
pretty steep slopes of blue ice and the
cars<00:05:00.790> proved<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.840> be<00:05:02.400> perfect<00:05:03.400> on<00:05:03.580> this

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
cars proved to be perfect on this

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
the Antarctic Plateau between the

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.700 
the Antarctic Plateau between the
mountains<00:05:19.979> will<00:05:20.979> be<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.190> real<00:05:21.610> good<00:05:22.510> test<00:05:22.840> all

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
mountains will be a real good test all

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.540 
mountains will be a real good test all
the<00:05:23.860> cars<00:05:24.130> for<00:05:24.580> people<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.120> equipment<00:05:25.720> and
