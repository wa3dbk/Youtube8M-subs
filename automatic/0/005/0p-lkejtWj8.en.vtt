com today I wanted to talk to you about

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.839 
com today I wanted to talk to you about
how<00:00:08.760> electric<00:00:09.570> cars<00:00:09.840> work<00:00:10.340> when<00:00:11.340> most<00:00:11.490> people

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
how electric cars work when most people

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.730 
how electric cars work when most people
hear<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.150> term<00:00:12.179> alternative<00:00:13.170> vehicle<00:00:13.590> they

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
hear the term alternative vehicle they

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.250 
hear the term alternative vehicle they
usually<00:00:14.070> think<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.370> an<00:00:14.519> electric<00:00:15.109> but<00:00:16.109> there

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
usually think of an electric but there

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.540 
usually think of an electric but there
are<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.590> people<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.070> don't<00:00:17.310> really

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
are a lot of people that don't really

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
are a lot of people that don't really
understand<00:00:18.210> how<00:00:18.539> an<00:00:18.840> electric<00:00:19.260> car<00:00:19.500> or

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
understand how an electric car or

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.019 
understand how an electric car or
vehicle<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:21.270> operates<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.550> wanted<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
vehicle actually operates so I wanted to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.679 
vehicle actually operates so I wanted to
just<00:00:24.180> quickly<00:00:24.480> explain<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.490> an<00:00:26.689> electric

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
just quickly explain that an electric

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.040 
just quickly explain that an electric
vehicle<00:00:27.869> has<00:00:28.349> three<00:00:29.039> basic<00:00:29.519> components<00:00:30.050> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
vehicle has three basic components to

vehicle has three basic components to
its<00:00:31.320> drivetrain<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.480> energy

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
its drivetrain that will be the energy

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
its drivetrain that will be the energy
storage<00:00:34.380> medium<00:00:34.829> which<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.670> batteries

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
storage medium which could be batteries

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.190 
storage medium which could be batteries
hydrogen<00:00:37.110> fuel<00:00:37.350> cell<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.860> tanks<00:00:38.719> any<00:00:39.719> number

combustion engine that provides
electricity<00:00:45.930> rather<00:00:46.410> than<00:00:46.710> propulsion<00:00:47.690> then

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
electricity rather than propulsion then

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
electricity rather than propulsion then
it<00:00:48.809> will<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.410> sort<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> control<00:00:49.980> unit

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it will have some sort of control unit

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
it will have some sort of control unit
which<00:00:50.969> will<00:00:51.210> include<00:00:51.870> things<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.379> an

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
which will include things like an

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
which will include things like an
inverter<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.129> other<00:00:53.489> things<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.180> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
inverter and other things like that it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.430 
inverter and other things like that it
controls<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.640> electricity<00:00:57.210> flow<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:58.230> much

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
controls the electricity flow how much

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.540 
controls the electricity flow how much
of<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.680> used<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.989> when<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.140> used<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of it is used and when it's used then it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
of it is used and when it's used then it
will<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.239> motor<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.379> motor<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
will have a motor and the motor is the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
will have a motor and the motor is the
unit<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:05.850> converts<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
unit that actually converts the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.530 
unit that actually converts the
electricity<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:08.000> mechanical<00:01:09.000> power<00:01:09.180> or

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
electricity to mechanical power or

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.580 
electricity to mechanical power or
movement<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> basic<00:01:12.900> layout<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.320> an

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
movement so the basic layout of an

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.700 
movement so the basic layout of an
electric<00:01:13.890> vehicle<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.409> some<00:01:16.409> sort<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
electric vehicle will have some sort of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.880 
electric vehicle will have some sort of
energy<00:01:17.130> storage<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.659> its<00:01:18.810> batteries<00:01:19.350> which

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
energy storage so if its batteries which

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.230 
energy storage so if its batteries which
will<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> heaviest<00:01:20.610> part<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> vehicle

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
will be the heaviest part of the vehicle

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
will be the heaviest part of the vehicle
at<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> point<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.159> put<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
at that point they will be put on the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
at that point they will be put on the
vehicle<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.380> position<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> would

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
vehicle in a position that would

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.330 
vehicle in a position that would
equalize<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> weight<00:01:27.509> across<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.860> vehicle

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
equalize the weight across the vehicle

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
equalize the weight across the vehicle
that's<00:01:29.880> assuming<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.390> vehicle<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.840> well<00:01:30.869> made

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that's assuming the vehicle as well made

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.730 
that's assuming the vehicle as well made
so<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.299> same<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.840> auto

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
so in the same way that auto

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.069 
so in the same way that auto
manufacturers<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.759> gasoline<00:01:36.390> cars

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
manufacturers that make gasoline cars

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.219 
manufacturers that make gasoline cars
put<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> engine<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.229> drivetrain

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
put the engine and the drivetrain

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.429 
put the engine and the drivetrain
components<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.100> other<00:01:41.700> things<00:01:42.110> along<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
components and other things along the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.990 
components and other things along the
vehicle<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.220> they'll<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> engine<00:01:44.729> up

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
vehicle so they'll put the engine up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.100 
vehicle so they'll put the engine up
front<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.630> they'll<00:01:45.750> put<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
front and then they'll put the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
front and then they'll put the
transmission<00:01:46.710> somewhere<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> center<00:01:47.930> in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
transmission somewhere in the center in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
transmission somewhere in the center in
order<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.409> try<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> equalize<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.280> weight

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
order to try to equalize the weight

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.020 
order to try to equalize the weight
across<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.780> car<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> fuel<00:01:53.640> tank<00:01:53.880> in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
across the car and then the fuel tank in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
across the car and then the fuel tank in
the<00:01:54.060> back<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:54.600> should<00:01:54.899> balance<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.890> weight

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the back which should balance the weight

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.459 
the back which should balance the weight
more<00:01:56.280> or<00:01:56.460> less<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:57.060> electric<00:01:57.930> vehicle<00:01:58.049> will

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
more or less an electric vehicle will

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.980 
more or less an electric vehicle will
have<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> battery<00:01:58.979> slung<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.969> such<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> way

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have the battery slung in such a way

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
have the battery slung in such a way
that<00:02:01.020> they're<00:02:01.320> equalized<00:02:01.890> usually<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.640> or

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that they're equalized usually that's or

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.420 
that they're equalized usually that's or
that<00:02:03.180> down<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> center<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> car<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.219> it's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that down the center of the car so it's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.770 
that down the center of the car so it's
directly<00:02:05.790> underneath<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> driver<00:02:06.600> and

hopefully I've given you an idea of how
an<00:07:17.649> electric<00:07:18.009> car<00:07:18.189> more<00:07:18.610> vehicle<00:07:19.089> works<00:07:19.710> you

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
an electric car more vehicle works you

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.230 
an electric car more vehicle works you
have<00:07:20.889> a<00:07:20.919> little<00:07:21.129> better<00:07:21.370> understanding<00:07:22.089> of

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
have a little better understanding of

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.129 
have a little better understanding of
what<00:07:22.599> a<00:07:23.759> what<00:07:24.759> an<00:07:24.939> electric<00:07:25.330> vehicle<00:07:25.479> can<00:07:25.930> do

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
what a what an electric vehicle can do

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.790 
what a what an electric vehicle can do
and<00:07:26.439> why<00:07:27.009> it<00:07:27.069> may<00:07:27.370> or<00:07:27.520> may<00:07:27.639> not<00:07:27.669> be<00:07:27.849> better<00:07:28.180> than

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
and why it may or may not be better than

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.790 
and why it may or may not be better than
internal<00:07:29.800> combustion<00:07:30.839> so<00:07:31.839> this<00:07:32.289> is<00:07:32.319> aaron

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
internal combustion so this is aaron

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.790
