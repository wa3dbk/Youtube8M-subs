00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.100
 is it 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.500
 and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.500
 and 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.050
 yes 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.610
 good 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
 t 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.360
 yes 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.830
 do not 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.840
 and 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.660
 and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.250
 so it's basically the light of two 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.409
 metal pieces one of them that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.100
 constitute the suction as half of 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:49.159
 take the pumping and another is the pipe that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.220
 comes from the plant the help of this 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.799
 supply infrastructure 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.110
 drinking water called in this case a 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.700
 brush what he does is raise the water 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.700
 from a lower level 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.250
 is a preventive type activity is 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.190
 to guarantee the quality of the water that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.050
 we deliver to users 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.819
 resulting and consists in the washing of 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.150
 the walls and floor to lead 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.280
 the process of water misfortunes the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.620
 chemicals can go over 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.349
 101 waste in the water that is going 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.599
 sedimenting on the tank floor and 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:39.810
 precisely the truth that is for 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:44.359
 remove these sediments these 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.359
 activities generate help to the plant 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:57.000
 which impacts certain sectors of 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:03:00.209
 medellín envigado itagüí and the star 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.519
 around storage or 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.489
 suspension of service can be between 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.069
 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Saturday, the 11th 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.129
 October until 2 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.830
 Sunday October 12 approximately 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.970
 100,000 installations 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.710
 in population are approximately 430,000 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.990
 implies that we would not have to imposture 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.300
 enough for this area also not 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.790
 supply the drinking water and stop 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.120
 the dispersion of the public aqueduct of 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.120
 much
