a comment on my best gaming achievement
abe's<00:00:18.240> exoddus<00:00:18.420> video<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.550> so<00:00:20.550> instead<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
abe's exoddus video and so instead it

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.330 
abe's exoddus video and so instead it
was<00:00:21.210> based<00:00:21.480> off<00:00:21.689> rhythm<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.289> music<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
was based off rhythm and music and that

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.500 
was based off rhythm and music and that
told<00:00:23.550> us<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.789> turned<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.269> totally

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510

level the music changes there's a sound
for<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> grab<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.500> goal<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.040> since

for when you grab the goal and since

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.880 
for when you grab the goal and since
it's<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.239> based<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> music<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
running is always constant every single

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
running is always constant every single
level<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.800> no<00:00:41.010> matter<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> play

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
level is the same no matter how you play

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030 
level is the same no matter how you play
it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> remember<00:00:43.140> ization<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:43.800> able

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it and just to remember ization I'm able

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
it and just to remember ization I'm able
to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.149> I'll<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.539> start<00:00:45.780> by<00:00:45.899> doing

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to do that so I'll just start by doing

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.670 
to do that so I'll just start by doing
level<00:00:46.530> 1<00:00:46.680> -<00:00:46.860> 1<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> starts<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
level 1 - 1 and now the way it starts is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.880 
level 1 - 1 and now the way it starts is
there's<00:00:53.270> measures<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.510> music<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.170> there's<00:00:55.559> 8

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
there's measures of music and there's 8

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
there's measures of music and there's 8
measures<00:00:56.629> until<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> first<00:00:57.960> jumped<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
measures until it first jumped now the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
measures until it first jumped now the
jump<00:00:58.859> sound<00:00:59.070> does<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.489> come<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.059> time<00:01:00.840> for

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
jump sound does not come in time for

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
jump sound does not come in time for
that's<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.430> jump<00:01:02.609> that's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that's not when you have to jump that's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
that's not when you have to jump that's
when<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.030> complete<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> jump<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.049> have

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
when you complete the jump so you have

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:14.270 
when you complete the jump so you have
to<00:01:04.409> jump<00:01:04.589> before<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:08.570> four<00:01:10.250> five<00:01:11.600> six<00:01:13.280> seven

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to jump before that four five six seven

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:29.420 
to jump before that four five six seven
first<00:01:15.150> up

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.210 

mr.<00:01:30.430> Pisa<00:01:30.640> :

next<00:01:39.220> month<00:01:39.370> offbeat<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.250> through

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
next month offbeat now and just through

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.860 
next month offbeat now and just through
memorization<00:01:48.910> I'm<00:01:49.180> able<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.510> pass<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.840> first

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
memorization I'm able to pass the first

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:58.650 
memorization I'm able to pass the first
but<00:01:50.260> they're<00:01:56.730> still<00:01:57.730> working<00:01:57.910> on<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.330> time<00:01:58.510> we

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
but they're still working on the time we

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.630 
but they're still working on the time we
put<00:01:58.810> out<00:01:58.930> one<00:01:59.110> piece<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.530> gold<00:02:01.980> so<00:02:02.980> in<00:02:03.220> levels

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
put out one piece of gold so in levels

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640 
put out one piece of gold so in levels
like<00:02:03.790> one<00:02:04.030> desktube<00:02:04.570> there<00:02:04.900> are<00:02:05.140> certain

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
like one desktube there are certain

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.140 
like one desktube there are certain
areas<00:02:05.980> where<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.400> jump<00:02:06.670> on<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.970> higher

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
areas where you can jump on to higher

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.500 
areas where you can jump on to higher
levels<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.960> more<00:02:08.230> power-ups<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:09.790> figured

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
levels to get more power-ups I figured

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.940 
levels to get more power-ups I figured
this<00:02:10.630> out<00:02:10.780> when<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:10.990> friend<00:02:11.260> told<00:02:11.350> me<00:02:11.650> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
this out when a friend told me and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.030 
this out when a friend told me and
through<00:02:12.910> YouTube<00:02:13.330> videos<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:14.020> discovered<00:02:14.890> that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
through YouTube videos I discovered that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.620 
through YouTube videos I discovered that
there's<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.580> certain<00:02:15.850> place<00:02:16.030> reeking<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
there's a certain place reeking in the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.940 
there's a certain place reeking in the
power-ups<00:02:17.140> where<00:02:17.350> they're<00:02:17.500> placed<00:02:17.770> but

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
power-ups where they're placed but

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
power-ups where they're placed but
throughout<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.310> level<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.690> still<00:02:19.930> haven't

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
throughout the level and I still haven't

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.170 
throughout the level and I still haven't
memorized<00:02:20.650> exactly<00:02:21.250> how<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.460> get<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.030> that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
memorized exactly how to get on to that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.620 
memorized exactly how to get on to that
top<00:02:22.390> level<00:02:22.690> yet<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.730> trial<00:02:25.030> there<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.360> will

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
top level yet just to trial there I will

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.840 
top level yet just to trial there I will
figure<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.140> out<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.490> get<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> pretty

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
figure it out but I can get a pretty

00:02:27.850 --> 00:03:06.420 
figure it out but I can get a pretty
good<00:02:28.060> score<00:02:28.240> on<00:02:28.360> level<00:02:28.570> 1<00:02:28.720> -<00:02:28.900> 2

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.010 

see<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.460> still<00:03:07.880> have<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.270> gotten<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.750> level

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
see I still have not gotten that level

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:38.130 
see I still have not gotten that level
right<00:03:09.050> there<00:03:09.170> yet<00:03:28.180> pretty<00:03:29.180> successful

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.660 

now<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.200> aspect<00:03:39.740> that<00:03:39.800> comes<00:03:40.040> in<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.370> level<00:03:40.640> 1

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
now the aspect that comes in the level 1

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.870 
now the aspect that comes in the level 1
-<00:03:41.030> 3<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.930> have<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.230> duck<00:03:42.440> under<00:03:42.770> stuff<00:03:43.010> now

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
- 3 is you have to duck under stuff now

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.420 
- 3 is you have to duck under stuff now
the<00:03:43.940> trick<00:03:44.450> about<00:03:44.690> those<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.320> they<00:03:45.830> do<00:03:45.890> not

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
the trick about those is they do not

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.550 
the trick about those is they do not
come<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.000> downbeat<00:03:47.510> like<00:03:48.320> this

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
come on the downbeat like this

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.250 
come on the downbeat like this
accessible<00:03:49.220> sound<00:03:49.550> for<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.850> jump<00:03:50.150> does<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.630> have

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
accessible sound for a jump does I have

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.820 
accessible sound for a jump does I have
to<00:03:51.440> duck<00:03:51.800> on<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:53.090> downbeat<00:03:53.600> for<00:03:54.290> instance<00:03:54.710> for

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
to duck on the downbeat for instance for

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.560 
to duck on the downbeat for instance for
a<00:03:54.920> jump<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.310> have<00:03:55.490> to<00:03:55.700> jump<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.090> before<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
a jump I have to jump just before the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.930 
a jump I have to jump just before the
downbeat<00:03:56.750> on<00:03:57.050> ducking<00:03:58.010> acted<00:03:58.280> up<00:03:58.490> just<00:03:58.790> before

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
downbeat on ducking acted up just before

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.220 
downbeat on ducking acted up just before
the<00:03:59.500> downbeat<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.950> if<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.670> makes<00:04:01.850> sense<00:04:02.230> so

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
the downbeat if if that makes sense so

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.080 
the downbeat if if that makes sense so
and<00:04:03.710> a<00:04:03.980> lot<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.460> times<00:04:04.640> I'll<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:04.940> hold

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
and a lot of the times I'll just hold

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.790 
and a lot of the times I'll just hold
the<00:04:05.270> down<00:04:05.420> button<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.930> makes<00:04:06.110> sure<00:04:06.320> I<00:04:06.350> can

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
the down button that makes sure I can

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.120 
the down button that makes sure I can
make<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.550> through<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.760> duck<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.930> I've<00:04:09.830> got<00:04:10.040> it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
make it through the duck but I've got it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:22.300 
make it through the duck but I've got it
a<00:04:10.160> perfect<00:04:10.460> on<00:04:10.580> 1-3

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:05:23.110 

four<00:04:23.840> five<00:04:24.840> six

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.790 

now<00:05:24.120> before<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.509> start<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:25.020> bonus<00:05:25.319> level<00:05:25.680> let

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
now before I start the bonus level let

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.580 
now before I start the bonus level let
me<00:05:25.860> talk<00:05:26.069> about<00:05:26.099> that<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:27.090> there's<00:05:27.750> no<00:05:27.990> music

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
me talk about that is there's no music

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.510 
me talk about that is there's no music
to<00:05:28.710> tell<00:05:28.979> me<00:05:29.360> when<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:31.009> jump<00:05:32.009> over<00:05:32.219> the<00:05:32.310> first

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
to tell me when to jump over the first

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.390 
to tell me when to jump over the first
object<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:34.590> way<00:05:34.740> I've<00:05:34.860> discovered<00:05:35.189> that

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
object and the way I've discovered that

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.550 
object and the way I've discovered that
I<00:05:35.490> can<00:05:35.699> move<00:05:35.909> basically<00:05:36.599> get<00:05:37.020> perfect<00:05:37.379> timing

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
I can move basically get perfect timing

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.980 
I can move basically get perfect timing
and<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.889> is<00:05:38.039> on<00:05:38.310> when<00:05:38.819> the<00:05:38.939> clip<00:05:39.120> bonus<00:05:39.719> level

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
and it is on when the clip bonus level

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.659 
and it is on when the clip bonus level
starts<00:05:40.259> I<00:05:40.349> start<00:05:40.590> mashing<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:41.189> jump<00:05:41.430> button

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
starts I start mashing the jump button

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.920 
starts I start mashing the jump button
until<00:05:42.360> he<00:05:42.840> can<00:05:43.710> jump<00:05:43.949> for<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.189> first<00:05:44.370> time<00:05:44.639> and

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
until he can jump for the first time and

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.510 
until he can jump for the first time and
after<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:46.169> hear<00:05:46.409> him<00:05:46.560> jump<00:05:46.860> for<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.039> first<00:05:47.250> time

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
after I hear him jump for the first time

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.469 
after I hear him jump for the first time
then<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.330> know<00:05:48.539> the<00:05:49.529> basic<00:05:50.400> amount<00:05:50.909> of<00:05:51.060> timing

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
then I know the basic amount of timing

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.749 
then I know the basic amount of timing
until<00:05:51.930> after<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.259> first<00:05:52.439> object<00:05:52.860> now<00:05:53.520> after

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
until after the first object now after

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.850 
until after the first object now after
the<00:05:53.849> first<00:05:54.000> object<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.509> beeping<00:05:54.870> starts<00:05:55.319> then

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
the first object the beeping starts then

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.920 
the first object the beeping starts then
I<00:05:55.979> can<00:05:56.129> count<00:05:56.279> the<00:05:56.430> amount<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.729> beeps<00:05:57.060> before<00:05:57.900> I

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
I can count the amount of beeps before I

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.990 
I can count the amount of beeps before I
have<00:05:58.139> to<00:05:58.259> jump<00:05:58.469> again<00:05:58.620> of<00:05:59.310> course<00:05:59.490> I<00:05:59.699> only<00:05:59.729> get

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
have to jump again of course I only get

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.879 
have to jump again of course I only get
to<00:06:00.090> practice<00:06:00.300> this<00:06:00.659> every<00:06:01.439> once<00:06:01.650> in<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.860> while

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
to practice this every once in a while

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.290 
to practice this every once in a while
and<00:06:02.159> I<00:06:02.189> get<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.340> perfect<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:02.909> I<00:06:02.939> don't<00:06:03.150> get<00:06:03.240> to

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
and I get a perfect so I don't get to

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.749 
and I get a perfect so I don't get to
practice<00:06:03.479> it<00:06:03.779> is<00:06:03.900> often<00:06:04.169> so<00:06:04.949> it's<00:06:05.520> gonna<00:06:05.610> be

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
practice it is often so it's gonna be

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:14.830 
practice it is often so it's gonna be
very<00:06:05.969> hard<00:06:06.180> to<00:06:06.300> keep<00:06:06.389> beat<00:06:06.629> up<00:06:06.750> on<00:06:06.870> this<00:06:06.990> level

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.629

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
ah he's still working on the timing

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.039 
ah he's still working on the timing
there
