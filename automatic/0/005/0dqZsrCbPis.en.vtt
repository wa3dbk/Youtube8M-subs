silky where

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.089 
silky where
I've<00:02:13.180> noticed<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.409> kind<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> human

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
I've noticed that with the kind of human

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.880 
I've noticed that with the kind of human
hair<00:02:15.280> texture<00:02:15.909> it<00:02:16.390> starts<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.200> drop<00:02:17.530> after

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
hair texture it starts to drop after

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.830 
hair texture it starts to drop after
while<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.580> maybe<00:02:18.819> because<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.629> this

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
while so maybe because it is this

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.559 
while so maybe because it is this
texture<00:02:20.349> things<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.370> kind<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.269> sit

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
texture things you know kind of sit

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.050 
texture things you know kind of sit

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
ulation with this hair I mean I just had

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.890 
ulation with this hair I mean I just had
to<00:03:06.040> go<00:03:06.159> like<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.400> because<00:03:06.609> it's<00:03:06.849> curly<00:03:07.269> but

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
to go like that because it's curly but

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.080 
to go like that because it's curly but
the<00:03:08.049> only<00:03:08.260> thing<00:03:08.470> i<00:03:08.799> don't<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.370> about<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.819> is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the only thing i don't like about it is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.119 
the only thing i don't like about it is
that<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.569> hair<00:03:10.810> looks<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.170> bit<00:03:11.290> more<00:03:11.470> fly<00:03:11.859> away

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
that the hair looks a bit more fly away

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.979 
that the hair looks a bit more fly away
so<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.609> looks<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:13.299> bit<00:03:13.540> frizzy

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
so it looks a little bit frizzy

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.370 
so it looks a little bit frizzy
sometimes<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.099> i<00:03:15.730> don't<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.989> put<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.200> lot

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
and you do notice after a day it gets

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.809 
and you do notice after a day it gets
very<00:03:31.629> very<00:03:31.959> tacky<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.739> top<00:03:32.980> wearers<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
very very tacky on top wearers with a

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.210 
very very tacky on top wearers with a
human<00:03:34.180> haired<00:03:34.419> wig<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:35.379> don't<00:03:35.560> really<00:03:35.769> tend

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
human haired wig you don't really tend

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.789 
human haired wig you don't really tend
to<00:03:36.430> feel<00:03:36.609> until<00:03:36.970> after<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> few<00:03:37.450> days<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.530> mean

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
to feel until after a few days so I mean

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.210 
to feel until after a few days so I mean
by<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.190> end<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.579> last<00:03:39.790> week<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:40.959> so<00:03:41.769> greasy

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
by the end of last week it was so greasy

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.890 
by the end of last week it was so greasy
and<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:42.609> think<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:42.940> because<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.569> silk

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
and I think it's because of that silk

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.439 
and I think it's because of that silk
texture<00:03:44.470> that's<00:03:44.949> the<00:03:45.129> only<00:03:45.699> thing<00:03:46.000> i<00:03:46.329> don't

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
texture that's the only thing i don't

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:51.689 
texture that's the only thing i don't

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
subtle with the hair color but enough to

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.550 
subtle with the hair color but enough to
kind<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.569> make<00:04:07.569> people<00:04:07.599> realize<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.470> you
