00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
the racetrack simulation has developed

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.400 
the racetrack simulation has developed
tremendously<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.780> an<00:01:55.870> incredibly

important part of racing now you know
you've<00:01:58.330> got<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.600> heartbeat<00:01:59.140> you've<00:01:59.410> got<00:01:59.590> the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
you've got the heartbeat you've got the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.160 
you've got the heartbeat you've got the
concentration<00:02:00.520> levels<00:02:00.910> you've<00:02:01.570> got<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
concentration levels you've got the the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.590 
concentration levels you've got the the
movement<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.220> going<00:02:03.550> around<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.880> circuit<00:02:04.330> so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
movement of going around the circuit so

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.930 
movement of going around the circuit so
he<00:02:05.410> can't<00:02:05.650> get<00:02:05.770> in<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.980> racing<00:02:06.340> car<00:02:06.370> yay<00:02:06.760> you
