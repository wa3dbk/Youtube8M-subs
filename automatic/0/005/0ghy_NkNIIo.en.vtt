the try cell casein and a regular casein

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.570 
the try cell casein and a regular casein
protein<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.210> micelle<00:00:24.840> XL<00:00:25.260> technology<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
protein is the micelle XL technology and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.830 
protein is the micelle XL technology and
that's<00:00:26.670> basically<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.300> break<00:00:27.630> up

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that's basically just a way to break up

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.839 
that's basically just a way to break up
the<00:00:28.230> molecules<00:00:28.830> even<00:00:29.070> further<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the molecules even further so it

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.450 
the molecules even further so it
increases<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.810> digestion<00:00:31.230> time<00:00:31.619> slower

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
increases the the digestion time slower

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.889 
increases the the digestion time slower
digestion<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.180> gonna<00:00:33.270> give<00:00:33.480> those<00:00:33.630> amino

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
digestion it's gonna give those amino

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.780 
digestion it's gonna give those amino
acids<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.500> time<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.950> continue<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> fill<00:00:35.550> fuel

casein<00:00:38.760> protein<00:00:39.180> you're<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.570> gonna<00:00:39.690> get

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
casein protein you're really gonna get

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.500 
casein protein you're really gonna get
that<00:00:40.020> anti<00:00:40.379> catabolic<00:00:41.030> muscle<00:00:42.030> building<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that anti catabolic muscle building so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
that anti catabolic muscle building so
it's<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.780> gonna<00:00:42.960> break<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.530> muscles

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's not gonna break down your muscles

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.869 
it's not gonna break down your muscles
as<00:00:43.920> fast<00:00:44.100> instead<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.460> gonna<00:00:44.520> help<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
as fast instead it's gonna help you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
as fast instead it's gonna help you
build<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.360> muscles<00:00:45.780> while<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.050> sleep<00:00:46.379> or

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
build up muscles while you sleep or

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.549 
build up muscles while you sleep or
between<00:00:46.950> meals<00:00:47.250> casings<00:00:48.149> often<00:00:48.480> often<00:00:49.140> taken

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
between meals casings often often taken

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
between meals casings often often taken
before<00:00:50.430> bed<00:00:50.610> time<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:51.180> between<00:00:51.480> meals<00:00:51.809> when

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
before bed time or between meals when

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.360 
before bed time or between meals when
you're<00:00:52.170> gonna<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> long<00:00:52.920> period<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> time

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you're gonna go a long period of time

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're gonna go a long period of time
without<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.969> protein<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.140> great<00:00:55.410> great

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
without that protein it's a great great

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
without that protein it's a great great
source<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> protein<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.600> gonna

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
source of protein because it's gonna

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
source of protein because it's gonna
enhance<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.739> absorption<00:00:59.219> over<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
enhance that absorption over time so the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
enhance that absorption over time so the
amino<00:01:00.600> acids<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.079> released<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.250> every

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
amino acids are released you know every

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
amino acids are released you know every
hours<00:01:03.030> every<00:01:03.270> few<00:01:03.449> hours<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.320> are

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hours every few hours so you really are

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.050 
hours every few hours so you really are
building<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.920> muscle<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.489> faster<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
building that muscle a lot faster and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.719 
building that muscle a lot faster and
with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> micelle<00:01:07.229> XL<00:01:07.950> technology<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
with the micelle XL technology the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.770 
with the micelle XL technology the
molecules<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.299> actually<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.659> bit

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
molecules are actually a little bit

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
molecules are actually a little bit
bigger<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.369> released

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bigger so they are going to be released

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
bigger so they are going to be released
a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:11.909> slower<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.900> really

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
a little slower so you can really

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
a little slower so you can really
stretch<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> benefits<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.670> you're

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
stretch out the benefits that you're

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
stretch out the benefits that you're
getting<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> casein<00:01:15.630> protein<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
getting from the casein protein and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.929 
getting from the casein protein and
casein<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.250> excellent<00:01:17.640> way<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
casein really is an excellent way to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
casein really is an excellent way to
just<00:01:18.330> keep<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.600> body<00:01:18.720> anabolic<00:01:19.530> even<00:01:20.130> after

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
just keep your body anabolic even after

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
just keep your body anabolic even after
a<00:01:20.460> workout<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.390> obviously<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.290> some

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a workout you obviously want to get some

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.749 
a workout you obviously want to get some
kind<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> whey<00:01:22.890> protein<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
kind of whey protein you want to get to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.640 
kind of whey protein you want to get to
a<00:01:23.820> medium<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.180> acid<00:01:24.540> delivery<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
a medium you know acid delivery you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.749 
a medium you know acid delivery you
could<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:25.890> mix<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.670> about

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
could actually mix just think about

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.420 
could actually mix just think about
mixing<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.509> scoop<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> casein<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> scoop<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mixing a scoop of casein with a scoop of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.530 
mixing a scoop of casein with a scoop of
whey<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.150> only<00:01:30.180> give<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
whey that's going to not only give you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
whey that's going to not only give you
that<00:01:30.659> Ameena<00:01:30.960> immediate<00:01:31.470> amino<00:01:31.799> acid

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that Ameena immediate amino acid

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.069 
that Ameena immediate amino acid
delivery<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.180> also<00:01:33.360> gonna<00:01:33.600> give<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
delivery it's also gonna give you that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
delivery it's also gonna give you that
sustained<00:01:34.619> release<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.729> body<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
sustained release that way your body is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
sustained release that way your body is
gonna<00:01:36.299> stay<00:01:36.479> anabolic<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.740> gonna

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
gonna stay anabolic and are gonna

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
gonna stay anabolic and are gonna
continue<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.400> feed<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.610> muscles<00:01:38.729> after<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
continue to feed your muscles after a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.999 
continue to feed your muscles after a
couple<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> hours<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.770> able<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
couple of hours so if you're not able to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.770

casein<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> great<00:01:49.049> protein<00:01:49.409> because

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
casein really is a great protein because

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
casein really is a great protein because
it's<00:01:49.920> got<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> amino<00:01:50.430> acid<00:01:50.759> l-theanine<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.479> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
it's got the amino acid l-theanine in it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
it's got the amino acid l-theanine in it
that<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.560> help<00:01:52.680> relax<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> body<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.549> it's
