00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
this is a bait that has been in

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.730 
this is a bait that has been in
development<00:00:06.939> for<00:00:07.419> a<00:00:07.629> long<00:00:07.870> long<00:00:08.139> time<00:00:08.200> and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
development for a long long time and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.850 
development for a long long time and
this<00:00:09.299> literally<00:00:10.299> I<00:00:10.809> mean<00:00:11.049> people<00:00:11.500> talk<00:00:11.709> about

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
this literally I mean people talk about

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.939 
this literally I mean people talk about
prototypes<00:00:12.580> I'll<00:00:13.150> let<00:00:13.389> this<00:00:13.539> fish<00:00:13.779> go<00:00:14.080> but

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:14.949 
prototypes I'll let this fish go but

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.179 
prototypes I'll let this fish go but
this<00:00:15.189> is<00:00:15.670> the<00:00:16.330> purest<00:00:17.170> form<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.619> a<00:00:17.740> prototype

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
this is the purest form of a prototype

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.890 
this is the purest form of a prototype
this<00:00:18.609> literally<00:00:19.090> is<00:00:19.510> a<00:00:20.500> bait<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:21.039> was<00:00:21.900> glued

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
this literally is a bait that was glued

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.840 
this literally is a bait that was glued
together<00:00:23.170> put<00:00:23.680> together<00:00:23.860> I<00:00:24.160> mean<00:00:24.400> this<00:00:24.550> is<00:00:24.760> an

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
together put together I mean this is an

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.260 
together put together I mean this is an
advanced<00:00:25.330> sample<00:00:26.289> and<00:00:26.850> you<00:00:27.850> know<00:00:27.940> by<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.119> time

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
advanced sample and you know by the time

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.000 
advanced sample and you know by the time
this<00:00:28.449> show<00:00:28.660> airs<00:00:28.690> we'll<00:00:29.350> have<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.590> polished

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
this show airs we'll have the polished

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.859 
this show airs we'll have the polished
beautiful<00:00:30.369> versions<00:00:30.760> but<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.270> whole<00:00:31.480> theory

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
beautiful versions but the whole theory

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.689 
beautiful versions but the whole theory
behind<00:00:31.960> this<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:32.739> think<00:00:33.010> about<00:00:33.100> it<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.430> mean<00:00:33.520> we

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
behind this is think about it I mean we

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.340 
behind this is think about it I mean we
all<00:00:33.820> use<00:00:34.000> crank<00:00:34.300> baits<00:00:34.570> in<00:00:34.690> their<00:00:34.809> rounds

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
all use crank baits in their rounds

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.969 
all use crank baits in their rounds
right<00:00:35.559> well<00:00:36.370> those<00:00:37.329> same<00:00:37.569> crank<00:00:37.960> baits<00:00:38.260> that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:38.979 
right well those same crank baits that

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.799 
right well those same crank baits that
are<00:00:39.069> round<00:00:39.249> are<00:00:39.640> supposed<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.909> imitate<00:00:40.089> bait

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
are round are supposed to imitate bait

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.419 
are round are supposed to imitate bait
fish<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:41.409> are<00:00:41.499> actually<00:00:41.769> long<00:00:41.979> and<00:00:42.219> skinny

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
fish that are actually long and skinny

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.729 
fish that are actually long and skinny
so<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.420> only<00:00:43.569> makes<00:00:43.839> sense<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.409> folks<00:00:44.620> that

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
so it only makes sense the folks that

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.410 
so it only makes sense the folks that
live<00:00:44.859> target<00:00:45.219> figured<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:45.670> out<00:00:45.760> we've<00:00:46.030> all<00:00:46.210> had

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
live target figured it out we've all had

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.809 
live target figured it out we've all had
it<00:00:46.449> wrong<00:00:46.839> for<00:00:47.199> years<00:00:47.379> and<00:00:47.649> years<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:48.370> doesn't

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
it wrong for years and years it doesn't

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.759 
it wrong for years and years it doesn't
imitate<00:00:49.030> when<00:00:49.389> a<00:00:49.420> fish<00:00:49.659> sees<00:00:49.899> that<00:00:50.139> shape<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.679> a

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
imitate when a fish sees that shape of a

imitate when a fish sees that shape of a
crank<00:00:51.010> bait<00:00:51.159> it<00:00:51.399> doesn't<00:00:51.940> think<00:00:52.089> it's<00:00:52.299> one

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
crank bait it doesn't think it's one

crank bait it doesn't think it's one
bait<00:00:52.899> fish<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.559> thinks<00:00:53.920> it's<00:00:54.039> multiple<00:00:54.519> bait

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
bait fish it thinks it's multiple bait

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.309 
bait fish it thinks it's multiple bait
fish<00:00:54.909> and<00:00:55.149> they're<00:00:55.510> trying<00:00:55.749> to<00:00:55.809> break<00:00:56.079> that
