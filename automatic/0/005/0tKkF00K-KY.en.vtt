this video of the Answer Man racing
Chuckie<00:00:13.740> starter<00:00:14.309> box<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.059> box<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
Chuckie starter box and box now this is

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
Chuckie starter box and box now this is
in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> limelight<00:00:18.270> today<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.170> we're<00:00:19.350> gonna

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
in the limelight today and we're gonna

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.410 
in the limelight today and we're gonna
do<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> quick<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> boxing<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.150> as

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
do a quick out a boxing of it this is as

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.019 
do a quick out a boxing of it this is as
I<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.570> said<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> chalky<00:00:22.380> slider<00:00:22.769> box<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
I just said the chalky slider box and so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.140 
I just said the chalky slider box and so
that<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.810> four<00:00:25.019> models<00:00:25.380> 1x<00:00:25.980> scaling<00:00:26.490> size<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
that is four models 1x scaling size and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.299 
that is four models 1x scaling size and
it<00:00:27.210> has<00:00:27.240> 2<00:00:27.689> motors<00:00:29.090> 750<00:00:30.090> size<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.679> got<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it has 2 motors 750 size so it's got the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
it has 2 motors 750 size so it's got the
bigger<00:00:32.550> motors<00:00:32.940> inside<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.930> double

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
bigger motors inside there and double

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.330 
bigger motors inside there and double
motors<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.040> four<00:00:35.430> engines<00:00:36.410> 21<00:00:37.410> size<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
motors as well four engines 21 size and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
motors as well four engines 21 size and
upwards<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> motive<00:00:40.469> power

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
upwards so this is the motive power

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
upwards so this is the motive power
starter<00:00:41.219> box<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.180> displayed

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
starter box and it's very nice displayed

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.860 
starter box and it's very nice displayed

tie the batteries onto the casing onto
the<00:01:31.680> holders<00:01:32.070> there's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.939> few<00:01:33.150> specifications

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the holders there's a few specifications

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.270 
the holders there's a few specifications
on<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.530> want<00:01:34.680> having<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.130> those

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
on here if you want having really those

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.020 
on here if you want having really those
you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.390> technical<00:01:36.990> data<00:01:38.030> something

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you can do the technical data something

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can do the technical data something
I<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.390> noticed<00:01:39.750> actually<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.229> contrasts

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I just noticed actually there contrasts

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
I just noticed actually there contrasts
what's<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> box<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.000> says<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
what's on the box it says here that it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
what's on the box it says here that it
can<00:01:43.740> take<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.070> input<00:01:44.460> voltage<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
can take an input voltage of up to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.270 
can take an input voltage of up to
fourteen<00:01:45.600> point<00:01:45.930> four<00:01:46.259> volts<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> guess

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
fourteen point four volts so I guess

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.240 
fourteen point four volts so I guess
actually<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.820> could<00:01:48.030> run<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.479> 14<00:01:49.439> point<00:01:49.619> 1<00:01:49.950> volt

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually you could run a 14 point 1 volt

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually you could run a 14 point 1 volt
lipo<00:01:50.850> over<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.299> maybe<00:01:52.250> fourteen<00:01:53.250> point<00:01:53.549> two

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
lipo over here maybe fourteen point two

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
lipo over here maybe fourteen point two
I'd<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:56.310> I've<00:01:56.430> never<00:01:56.610> be

I'd like off there yeah I've never be
interesting<00:01:57.450> I've<00:01:57.570> seen<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.290> happens<00:01:58.500> there

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
interesting I've seen what happens there

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
interesting I've seen what happens there
and<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.810> course<00:02:00.840> here's<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:01.350> these

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and of course here's all these

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.380 
and of course here's all these
specifications<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.850> obviously

this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.869> largest<00:02:04.229> otterbox<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> two

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
this is the largest otterbox of the two

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
this is the largest otterbox of the two
and<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:05.790> powerful<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.540> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and the more powerful one because it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.290 
and the more powerful one because it's
for<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> larger<00:02:07.619> engines<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> actually

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
for the larger engines but I actually

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.580 
for the larger engines but I actually
recommend<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.140> you're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
recommend if you're going to get a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.860 
recommend if you're going to get a
slider<00:02:10.890> box<00:02:11.129> why<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.879> get<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.270> larger

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
slider box why not just get the larger

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.490 
slider box why not just get the larger
one<00:02:12.900> because

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
one because

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
one because
obviously<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:15.270> powerful<00:02:15.930> one

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
obviously if you have a powerful one

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.540 
obviously if you have a powerful one
that<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.800> be<00:02:16.890> able<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> start<00:02:17.310> any

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that is going to be able to start any

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.210 
that is going to be able to start any
size<00:02:17.880> engine<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> less<00:02:19.770> powerful

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
size engine if you get the less powerful

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.740 
size engine if you get the less powerful
one<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.610> you're<00:02:20.910> only<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.210> able<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.390> start<00:02:21.600> the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
one and you're only be able to start the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.910 
one and you're only be able to start the
engines<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.520> point<00:02:23.880> 21<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.690> size<00:02:25.020> so

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
engines up to the point 21 in size so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.680 
engines up to the point 21 in size so
we've<00:02:26.550> had<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> quick<00:02:26.910> look<00:02:26.940> at<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.240> manual<00:02:27.570> I'm

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
we've had a quick look at the manual I'm

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.820 
we've had a quick look at the manual I'm
already<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> look<00:02:28.320> through<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
already going to look through it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.610 
already going to look through it
I'm<00:02:29.430> sure<00:02:29.670> there's<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.390> there<00:02:30.620> now

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
I'm sure there's not much in there now

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.199 
I'm sure there's not much in there now
what<00:02:31.860> we're<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.190> do<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.580> take<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
what we're going to do is take the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.630 
what we're going to do is take the
starter<00:02:33.660> box<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.260> polythene<00:02:34.560> bag<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
starter box out of the polythene bag and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.490 
starter box out of the polythene bag and
open<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.209> up<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.540> take<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> look<00:02:36.959> you'll<00:02:37.320> have

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
open it up and take a look you'll have

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.740 
open it up and take a look you'll have
to<00:02:37.620> excuse<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.340> box<00:02:38.670> being<00:02:38.940> black<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
to excuse the box being black and the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.560 
to excuse the box being black and the
background<00:02:40.320> being<00:02:40.590> black<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.640> won't<00:02:42.300> change

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
background being black I won't change

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.260 
background being black I won't change
the<00:02:42.780> background<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.320> white<00:02:43.500> now<00:02:43.820> but<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.209> you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
the background to white now but here you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.199 
the background to white now but here you
can<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> nice<00:02:46.140> little<00:02:46.500> unit<00:02:46.820> nice<00:02:47.820> in

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
can see it's a nice little unit nice in

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.470 
can see it's a nice little unit nice in
size<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.989> see<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.590> these<00:02:50.180> grips<00:02:51.180> on

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
size you can see we have these grips on

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.060 
size you can see we have these grips on
the<00:02:51.570> top<00:02:51.750> pair<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.560> vehicle<00:02:52.950> will

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
the top pair so that the vehicle will

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.740 
the top pair so that the vehicle will
actually<00:02:53.430> grip<00:02:53.730> onto<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.360> top<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.660> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
actually grip onto the top of the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.180 
actually grip onto the top of the
surface<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.410> you're<00:02:55.530> trying<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.800> start<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
surface when you're trying to start the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.910 
surface when you're trying to start the
engine<00:02:56.489> we<00:02:56.910> have<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.330> large<00:02:57.660> flywheel<00:02:58.380> opening

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
engine we have a large flywheel opening

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.890 
engine we have a large flywheel opening
then<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.310> key<00:02:59.580> because<00:02:59.790> some<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
then this is key because some of the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.479 
then this is key because some of the
starter<00:03:01.200> boxes<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.739> I've<00:03:01.890> been<00:03:02.070> looking<00:03:02.370> at

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
starter boxes that I've been looking at

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.370 
starter boxes that I've been looking at
recently<00:03:02.720> before<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.750> ordered<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.170> one

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
recently before I ordered this one

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.949 
recently before I ordered this one
actually<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.280> very<00:03:05.730> small<00:03:06.120> openings<00:03:06.720> so

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
actually have very small openings so

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.500 
actually have very small openings so
it's<00:03:07.110> only<00:03:07.350> suitable<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.800> some<00:03:08.610> engines<00:03:09.060> this

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it's only suitable for some engines this

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.440 
it's only suitable for some engines this
one<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.290> much<00:03:10.560> larger<00:03:11.220> okay<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.270> will

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
one is a much larger okay and the will

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
one is a much larger okay and the will
is<00:03:12.830> abnormally<00:03:13.830> narrow<00:03:14.130> as<00:03:14.550> well<00:03:14.790> which<00:03:14.970> is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
is abnormally narrow as well which is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.760 
is abnormally narrow as well which is
nice<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:15.570> if<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.020> gap<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.709> your

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
nice so if you have a gap in your

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.370 
nice so if you have a gap in your
chassis<00:03:17.400> which<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.760> only<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.630> wide

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
chassis which is only like this wide

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.250 
chassis which is only like this wide
this<00:03:20.010> will<00:03:20.370> still<00:03:20.730> fit<00:03:21.299> in<00:03:21.570> there<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.110> is

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
this will still fit in there so this is

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.660 
this will still fit in there so this is
highly<00:03:22.470> recommended<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.370> one<00:03:23.580> of

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
highly recommended if you have one of

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.050 
highly recommended if you have one of
those

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
those

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.630 
those
Sassy's<00:03:24.930> which<00:03:25.110> only<00:03:25.410> has<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> small<00:03:26.070> opening

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
Sassy's which only has a small opening

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.360 
Sassy's which only has a small opening
or<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.450> very<00:03:28.410> thin<00:03:28.920> or<00:03:29.130> small

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
or you have a very thin or small

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.180 
or you have a very thin or small
flywheel<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.750> your<00:03:30.810> engine<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.799> this

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
flywheel on your on your engine so this

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.820 
flywheel on your on your engine so this
is<00:03:32.340> nice<00:03:32.519> as<00:03:32.730> well<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:34.140> actually<00:03:34.590> pushes

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
is nice as well and it actually pushes

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.520 
is nice as well and it actually pushes
down<00:03:35.190> fairly<00:03:35.790> long<00:03:36.120> way<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.810> again<00:03:37.200> if<00:03:37.410> you

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
down fairly long way so again if you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.320 
down fairly long way so again if you
have<00:03:37.560> one<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.070> those<00:03:38.190> engines<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.269> are

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
have one of those engines that are

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.199 
have one of those engines that are
raised<00:03:40.019> quite<00:03:40.470> far<00:03:40.799> off<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.250> chassis<00:03:41.459> this

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
raised quite far off the chassis this

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.509 
raised quite far off the chassis this
will<00:03:42.420> stick<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:43.170> up<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.680> connect<00:03:44.160> onto<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
will stick right up and connect onto the

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.789 
will stick right up and connect onto the
flywheel<00:03:44.790> properly<00:03:45.570> we<00:03:46.200> have<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.380> few<00:03:46.650> nice

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
flywheel properly we have a few nice

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.890 
flywheel properly we have a few nice

inside you can access the connectors the
cables<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.110> course<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.470> batteries<00:04:04.980> let's

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
cables and of course the batteries let's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.520 
cables and of course the batteries let's
take<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> look<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:06.269> remove<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.750> one<00:04:07.110> screw

can actually use it off the 12-volt

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.740 
can actually use it off the 12-volt
battery<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:52.050> around<00:04:52.349> this<00:04:52.560> size<00:04:53.479> we<00:04:54.479> have

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
battery and around this size we have

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.469 
battery and around this size we have
some<00:04:55.379> this<00:04:55.979> is<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.250> holder<00:04:56.639> here<00:04:56.849> for<00:04:57.180> the

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
some this is the holder here for the

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.510 
some this is the holder here for the
simple<00:04:58.050> two<00:04:58.440> volt<00:04:58.650> batteries<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.370> have<00:04:59.490> a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
simple two volt batteries and you have a

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.240 
simple two volt batteries and you have a
few<00:04:59.729> screws<00:05:00.060> pads<00:05:00.509> metal<00:05:00.960> pads<00:05:01.169> etc<00:05:01.710> except<00:05:02.009> in

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
few screws pads metal pads etc except in

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.809 
few screws pads metal pads etc except in
there

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
there

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:08.120 
there
and<00:05:02.909> here<00:05:03.900> we<00:05:04.080> have<00:05:04.319> a<00:05:05.659> loop<00:05:06.659> connector<00:05:07.590> okay

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
and here we have a loop connector okay

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.309 
and here we have a loop connector okay
so<00:05:08.669> if<00:05:08.759> you're<00:05:08.909> just<00:05:09.120> using<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.840> crocodile

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
so if you're just using the crocodile

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.890 
so if you're just using the crocodile
clips<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:11.099> loops<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.789> round<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.449> can

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
clips this loops it round so you can

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.439 
clips this loops it round so you can
just<00:05:13.139> use<00:05:13.560> one<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:14.130> me<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> connector<00:05:14.759> but<00:05:15.150> if

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
just use one to me a connector but if

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.820 
just use one to me a connector but if
you're<00:05:15.569> going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.840> using<00:05:15.960> two<00:05:16.289> batteries

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
you're going to be using two batteries

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.110 
you're going to be using two batteries
then<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:18.240> simply<00:05:18.690> remove<00:05:18.870> this<00:05:19.349> one<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.940> that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
then you simply remove this one so that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.950 
then you simply remove this one so that
you<00:05:21.270> have<00:05:21.710> two<00:05:22.849> Sameer<00:05:23.849> connectors<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.539> there

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
you have two Sameer connectors on there

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.200 
you have two Sameer connectors on there
so<00:05:25.469> you<00:05:25.530> can<00:05:25.680> connect<00:05:26.009> 17.2<00:05:26.849> your<00:05:26.969> old<00:05:27.090> battery

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
so you can connect 17.2 your old battery

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.659 
so you can connect 17.2 your old battery
to<00:05:27.509> this<00:05:27.629> one<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.110> obviously<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.310> other<00:05:29.430> one

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
to this one and obviously the other one

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.120 
to this one and obviously the other one
to<00:05:30.180> this<00:05:30.300> one<00:05:30.539> so<00:05:30.990> it's<00:05:31.110> very<00:05:31.169> nice<00:05:31.500> setup<00:05:31.800> and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.860 
nice I'm just gonna tilt this one up now
and<00:05:38.280> we'll<00:05:38.550> take<00:05:38.789> a<00:05:38.819> closer<00:05:39.210> look<00:05:39.330> at<00:05:39.690> the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
and we'll take a closer look at the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.219 
and we'll take a closer look at the
motor

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
motor

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.589 
motor
we're<00:05:40.919> now<00:05:41.009> looking<00:05:41.159> directly<00:05:41.580> inside<00:05:42.360> these

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
we're now looking directly inside these

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.779 
we're now looking directly inside these
starter<00:05:43.080> box<00:05:43.289> and<00:05:43.590> it's<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.919> very<00:05:44.130> nice<00:05:44.250> clean

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
starter box and it's a very nice clean

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.820 
starter box and it's a very nice clean
setup<00:05:45.509> here<00:05:45.750> there's<00:05:45.990> no<00:05:46.139> cables<00:05:46.620> running

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
setup here there's no cables running

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.659 
setup here there's no cables running
everywhere<00:05:47.449> here<00:05:48.449> we<00:05:48.539> have<00:05:48.719> two<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.770> these<00:05:49.919> 750

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
everywhere here we have two of these 750

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.740 
everywhere here we have two of these 750
motors<00:05:51.000> so<00:05:51.270> one<00:05:51.509> 750<00:05:52.199> and<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:52.919> 750<00:05:53.599> it's<00:05:54.599> a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
motors so one 750 and it to 750 it's a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.629 
motors so one 750 and it to 750 it's a
push<00:05:55.020> down<00:05:55.229> spring<00:05:55.650> system<00:05:56.130> so<00:05:56.400> basically

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
push down spring system so basically

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.689 
push down spring system so basically
when<00:05:56.849> you<00:05:56.880> push<00:05:57.120> this<00:05:57.300> down<00:05:57.360> there's<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.699> metal

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
when you push this down there's a metal

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.370 
when you push this down there's a metal
thingy<00:06:00.330> on<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.509> bottom<00:06:00.870> there<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.139> this

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
thingy on the bottom there and this

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.870 
thingy on the bottom there and this
could<00:06:01.590> lease<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.949> circuit<00:06:02.430> there<00:06:02.669> for

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
could lease the circuit there for

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
could lease the circuit there for
turning<00:06:03.659> on<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:04.169> motors<00:06:04.710> and<00:06:05.669> here<00:06:06.539> we<00:06:06.659> have

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
turning on the motors and here we have

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.249 
turning on the motors and here we have
the<00:06:07.490> belts<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.699> they've<00:06:08.909> run<00:06:09.060> itself<00:06:09.569> okay

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
the belts and they've run itself okay

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.589 
the belts and they've run itself okay
this<00:06:10.529> is<00:06:10.680> one<00:06:10.889> less<00:06:11.099> I<00:06:11.219> just<00:06:11.430> said<00:06:11.669> by<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:11.969> belt

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
this is one less I just said by a belt

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.620 
this is one less I just said by a belt
joining<00:06:13.349> on<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.529> two<00:06:13.979> pinion<00:06:14.789> gears<00:06:15.029> on<00:06:15.270> there

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
joining on the two pinion gears on there

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.140 
joining on the two pinion gears on there
and<00:06:15.930> that<00:06:16.380> basically<00:06:16.800> is<00:06:16.919> all<00:06:17.400> there<00:06:17.550> is<00:06:17.729> to<00:06:18.000> it

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
and that basically is all there is to it

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.209 
and that basically is all there is to it
there's<00:06:18.330> a<00:06:18.419> large<00:06:18.960> area<00:06:19.229> in<00:06:19.590> here<00:06:19.800> for<00:06:20.009> you<00:06:20.069> to

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
there's a large area in here for you to

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.249 
there's a large area in here for you to
install<00:06:20.460> your<00:06:20.759> battery<00:06:21.180> if<00:06:21.599> you<00:06:21.750> used<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:21.990> find

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
install your battery if you used to find

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.999 
install your battery if you used to find
a<00:06:22.560> fairly<00:06:23.550> small<00:06:23.909> 12<00:06:24.330> volts<00:06:24.779> and<00:06:25.740> in<00:06:25.919> a

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
a fairly small 12 volts and in a

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.890 
a fairly small 12 volts and in a
motorcycle<00:06:26.759> battery<00:06:27.060> etc<00:06:27.419> it<00:06:27.539> would<00:06:27.659> probably

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
motorcycle battery etc it would probably

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.999 
motorcycle battery etc it would probably
fit<00:06:28.289> very<00:06:28.560> nicely<00:06:28.770> inside<00:06:29.490> here<00:06:29.789> as<00:06:29.909> well

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
fit very nicely inside here as well

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.070 
fit very nicely inside here as well
overall<00:06:32.009> it's<00:06:32.250> a<00:06:32.340> very<00:06:32.370> nice<00:06:32.699> unit<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.569> I<00:06:33.870> will

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
overall it's a very nice unit and I will

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.070 
overall it's a very nice unit and I will
be<00:06:34.199> posting<00:06:34.680> some<00:06:34.860> videos<00:06:34.889> of<00:06:35.370> it's<00:06:35.520> starting

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
be posting some videos of it's starting

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.610 
be posting some videos of it's starting
21<00:06:37.080> engines

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
21 engines

18 engines and

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.580 
18 engines and
we'll<00:06:38.980> be<00:06:39.130> try<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.580> bit<00:06:39.970> block<00:06:40.330> 32<00:06:41.320> anything

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
we'll be try a bit block 32 anything

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.080 
we'll be try a bit block 32 anything
that<00:06:41.740> I<00:06:41.800> would<00:06:41.980> try<00:06:42.190> to<00:06:42.220> get<00:06:42.340> hold<00:06:42.550> off<00:06:42.730> soon

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
that I would try to get hold off soon

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.240 
that I would try to get hold off soon
just<00:06:43.390> for<00:06:43.540> testing<00:06:43.900> purposes<00:06:44.320> for<00:06:44.980> they

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
just for testing purposes for they

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.850 
just for testing purposes for they
starter<00:06:45.760> box<00:06:45.910> see<00:06:46.210> how<00:06:46.390> well<00:06:46.630> it<00:06:46.870> turns<00:06:47.200> over<00:06:47.500> a

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
starter box see how well it turns over a

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.740 
starter box see how well it turns over a
an<00:06:48.580> Jian<00:06:48.970> with<00:06:49.120> loads<00:06:49.390> and<00:06:49.540> loads<00:06:49.570> of

an Jian with loads and loads of
compression<00:06:50.350> before<00:06:50.950> we<00:06:51.250> end<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.430> video<00:06:51.520> I

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
compression before we end the video I

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.640 
compression before we end the video I
should<00:06:52.060> mention<00:06:52.240> that<00:06:52.450> this<00:06:52.720> is<00:06:52.960> actually<00:06:53.470> my

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
should mention that this is actually my

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.650 
should mention that this is actually my
second<00:06:54.190> starter<00:06:54.580> box<00:06:54.730> the<00:06:55.030> first<00:06:55.210> one<00:06:55.510> I<00:06:55.540> did

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
second starter box the first one I did

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.540 
second starter box the first one I did
have<00:06:56.050> to<00:06:56.170> send<00:06:56.470> back<00:06:56.650> because<00:06:56.710> of<00:06:57.250> a<00:06:57.310> defect

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
have to send back because of a defect

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.450 
have to send back because of a defect
that<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.060> had<00:06:58.270> it<00:06:59.230> had<00:06:59.260> a<00:06:59.770> problem<00:07:00.100> with<00:07:00.340> the

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
that it had it had a problem with the

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.060 
that it had it had a problem with the
motors<00:07:00.820> they<00:07:01.060> were<00:07:01.120> not<00:07:02.110> running<00:07:02.440> powerfully

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
motors they were not running powerfully

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.350 
motors they were not running powerfully
enough<00:07:03.130> there's<00:07:03.490> a<00:07:03.580> fault<00:07:03.850> with<00:07:04.030> one<00:07:04.150> of<00:07:04.240> these

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
enough there's a fault with one of these

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.180 
enough there's a fault with one of these
motors<00:07:04.750> here<00:07:04.930> so<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.080> did<00:07:05.290> have<00:07:05.440> to<00:07:05.500> return<00:07:05.980> it

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
motors here so I did have to return it

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.040 
motors here so I did have to return it
just<00:07:06.700> something<00:07:06.970> to<00:07:07.120> look<00:07:07.150> out<00:07:07.510> for<00:07:07.810> if<00:07:07.930> you're

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
just something to look out for if you're

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.500 
just something to look out for if you're
planning<00:07:08.410> buying<00:07:08.650> one<00:07:08.890> of<00:07:08.920> these<00:07:09.300> you<00:07:10.300> should

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
planning buying one of these you should

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.430 
planning buying one of these you should
consider<00:07:11.820> just<00:07:12.820> last<00:07:13.360> thing<00:07:13.630> before<00:07:13.930> we<00:07:14.170> go<00:07:14.320> it

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 
consider just last thing before we go it

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.860 
consider just last thing before we go it
also<00:07:14.620> has<00:07:14.950> a<00:07:14.980> convenient<00:07:15.580> carrying<00:07:16.180> handle<00:07:16.270> on

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
also has a convenient carrying handle on

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.830 
also has a convenient carrying handle on
the<00:07:17.140> side<00:07:17.320> there<00:07:17.620> so<00:07:18.360> yeah<00:07:19.360> it's<00:07:19.510> a<00:07:19.600> fairly

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
the side there so yeah it's a fairly

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.330 
the side there so yeah it's a fairly
heavy<00:07:20.020> unit<00:07:20.440> to<00:07:20.530> be<00:07:20.650> cutting<00:07:20.980> around<00:07:21.100> the

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
heavy unit to be cutting around the

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.000 
heavy unit to be cutting around the
field<00:07:21.580> but<00:07:21.850> of<00:07:22.030> course<00:07:22.240> if<00:07:22.360> you<00:07:22.450> have<00:07:22.660> the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
field but of course if you have the

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.230 
field but of course if you have the
