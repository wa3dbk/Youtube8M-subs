 I will record the whole event and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.279
 try as much as possible 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.990
 analyze and become my own 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 to bring in little opinion so you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.750

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 the announcement store in the construction 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.460
 shown and besides it says that itself 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 Microsoft at this announcement of the wii 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.680
 hardware specializes and the tons 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.890
 wheat at games follow only on the e3 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.629
 2013 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.460
 and it should be tons of exclusive 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.410
 We can be games for everyone 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 Fall times where you look forward to the whole 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.770
 i can follow xbox live 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
 unfortunately not yet but I type 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.090
 to the xbox live event player at the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.859
 Last year you can already see the e3 2012 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.480
 could be synonymous if with me at the moment 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.010
 this is displayed at the moment no 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.360
 another event is imminent 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.549
 look your best in the next 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.110
 two days makes xbox live and see if 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.979
 he finds any new app there and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.450
 then I have something for you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.250
 this year's gamescom visitors below 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 you microsoft will in contrast to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.790
 represented at gamescom last year 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 and she is there other features 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.189
 and we will play games best times 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 continue with gta 5 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.119
 rockstar announced that gta 5 is not 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.130
 will be announced at e3 2013 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.610
 instead you want to have your own events 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 put 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.159
 But there is a small consolation 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.229
 Still, we have four more 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 screenshots are delivered on it 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.920
 recognizes my successes said with franklin 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 on a dirtbike a car theft 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 of fleeing strike and a diver 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.320
 next to a submarine under water 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.909
 And besides, I have a really cool 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.159
 fan action found you with 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.229
 safety might be there were fans 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.579
 the gta 5 trailer of michael in gta 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.960
 san andreas re-enacted 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.189
 Here is a small excerpt and I have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.939
 both trailer times in the video 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.939
 description packed 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.759
 a thing that I do not like so much 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.290
 is what now Ubisoft said after 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.460
 The developers with Assassin's creed and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.140
 every year a new graduate 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.060
 they want to publish the whole thing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.989
 still with far cry and further ubisoft 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.819
 play 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.530
 I think this money make or call 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.330
 of duty tact pretty shitty and me 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.350
 Just want to have your opinion in the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.360
 Comments read the new one 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.590
 handheld console nvidia shell got 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.540
 a rough appointment for the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.069
 American market missed the june 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.140
 This year it should be but that 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.630
 whole is not necessarily so cheap 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.830
 the americans are to be proud of 349 dollars 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.150
 to flip on the table 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.769
 when you are in germany right now 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.269
 appears is not yet known to 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.269
 but let us back another video 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.310
 many of you probably already have 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.069
 a little insight in ubisoft 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.180
 masterpiece hot dogs seen before circa 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.860
 One week we were with a new one 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.019
 Gameplay brings which 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.760
 Vengeance by the cargo takes her 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.980
 Know where you find the link together 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.100
 with the profiling and hedging of the people 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.989
 around you where most games with 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.160
 we stop the simulation 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.320
 just now 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.329
 we simulate the data to everyone 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.530
 remember me interested capcom has in 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.420
 play a story-trailer 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.799
 she misses out pretty cool and the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.640
 link to this is in the video description 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.640
 's hospice 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.850
 2011 and it's nokias 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.650
 The energy is also a trailer 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.910
 we got from the vampire game day 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.170
 the trailer shows the different ones 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.940
 Skills skills in the game 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.710
 can use and the game comes by the way 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.460
 only in the summer out so we still have 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.460
 long time until then 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.850
 to take 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.620
 and for all of you always that 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.180
 have plasma cutter of dead space 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.500
 wanted a fan has it 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.870
 has dealt with it 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.650
 made such a replica and he 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.200
 made it 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.240
 This has a reload can 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.400
 Wood provided with burn holes by laser 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.140
 and can the rotational movements as in the game 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.910
 around 200 hours of work are behind it 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.320
 but personally I'm pretty horny 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 and last but not least a little 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.270
 google is right for you 37 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.680
 jubilee of ataris breakout was the 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.200
 google picture search with a mini-game 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 provided you just give it small and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.860
 without hyphen atari breakout in the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.540
 google picture search on or go on 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.790
 the link in the video description and 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.800
 then see for yourself and that's it too 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.970
 already at the end of this game report if 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.350
 you liked it and you 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.820
 has informed it shows your gambler 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.160
 colleagues and friends and evaluates that 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.900
 video with a thumb up or with 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.460
 a thumb down writes how the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.210
 comments on what I should improve what 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.830
 to change 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.570
 Of course, just a lot of fun 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.900
 when gambling even if the weather is not 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.560
 is absolutely suitable from as much 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.560
 fun
