00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
bandwidth which means that my server was

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.090 
bandwidth which means that my server was
creating<00:01:13.600> too<00:01:13.780> much<00:01:13.870> bandwidth<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.560> creating

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
it so I couldn't go back onto my old

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.440 
it so I couldn't go back onto my old
server<00:01:32.260> get<00:01:32.440> all<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.710> old<00:01:32.860> maps<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.970> it's

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
server get all the old maps so it's

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.640 
server get all the old maps so it's
really<00:01:34.720> really<00:01:35.050> crap<00:01:35.230> but<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.410> know<00:01:35.500> that's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
really really crap but you know that's

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.290 
really really crap but you know that's
how<00:01:35.740> that's<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.160> anyway<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.760> this<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.090> new

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
how that's it anyway so this is the new

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.640 
how that's it anyway so this is the new
server<00:01:37.510> now<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.020> if<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.140> go<00:01:38.230> back<00:01:38.350> up<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.620> the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
server now so if you go back up to the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.330 
server now so if you go back up to the
spawn<00:01:38.980> Oh<00:01:39.220> type<00:01:40.120> in<00:01:40.240> spawn<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.250> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
spawn Oh type in spawn so this is the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.160

the new guys spawn which means you'll

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.370 
the new guys spawn which means you'll
need<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> register<00:01:46.420> before<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:46.810> can<00:01:46.960> play<00:01:47.140> and

and<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:47.580> can't<00:03:47.790> prove<00:03:47.940> myself<00:03:48.090> right<00:03:48.390> now<00:03:48.450> but

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and I can't prove myself right now but

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.190 
and I can't prove myself right now but
as<00:03:48.960> um<00:03:50.690> yeah<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.720> don't<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.170> that

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
as um yeah I don't really do that

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.720 
as um yeah I don't really do that
because<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.770> quick<00:03:53.280> episode<00:03:53.400> to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
because it's just a quick episode to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.180 
because it's just a quick episode to
tell<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:53.970> guys<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.350> my<00:03:55.350> new<00:03:55.590> server<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.070> up

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
tell you guys that my new server is up

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.580 
tell you guys that my new server is up
and<00:03:56.430> running<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> beast<00:03:57.870> server<00:03:58.200> it's

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
and running it is a beast server it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.980 
and running it is a beast server it's
got<00:03:59.460> a<00:03:59.490> lot<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.970> bandwidth<00:04:00.420> got<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.750> lot<00:04:00.960> of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
got a lot of the bandwidth got a lot of

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.920 
got a lot of the bandwidth got a lot of
our<00:04:01.200> CPU<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.450> think<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
our CPU it's on a I think it's not a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.330 
our CPU it's on a I think it's not a
dedicated<00:04:04.350> server<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.800> time<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.220> it's

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
dedicated server this time so it's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.400 
dedicated server this time so it's
actually<00:04:05.700> quite<00:04:06.270> you<00:04:07.050> shouldn't<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.380> any

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
actually quite you shouldn't have any

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.840 
actually quite you shouldn't have any
lag<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.980> he<00:04:08.100> where<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> world<00:04:08.520> because

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
lag and he where in the world because

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.460 
lag and he where in the world because
it's<00:04:08.970> based<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.390> them<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.990> based<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
it's based in them it's based in the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.840 
it's based in them it's based in the
u.s.<00:04:10.770> so<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.190> might<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.490> little<00:04:11.640> bit<00:04:11.820> of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
u.s. so you might have a little bit of

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.790 
u.s. so you might have a little bit of
lag<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.180> Europe<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.510> happen<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.350> everywhere

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
lag in Europe and happen and everywhere

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.350 
lag in Europe and happen and everywhere

creation by mini watteau just before I
leave<00:04:51.960> he<00:04:52.960> made<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.170> massive<00:04:53.770> structure<00:04:54.610> it<00:04:54.790> is

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
leave he made a massive structure it is

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.120 
leave he made a massive structure it is
awesome<00:04:55.930> i'm<00:04:56.020> pretty<00:04:56.260> sure<00:04:56.410> it's<00:04:56.560> called<00:04:56.770> sky

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
awesome i'm pretty sure it's called sky

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.100 
awesome i'm pretty sure it's called sky
point<00:04:57.460> so<00:04:58.240> if<00:04:58.390> we<00:04:58.540> can<00:04:58.690> warp<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.200> score<00:04:59.560> point

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
point so if we can warp to score point

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.940 
point so if we can warp to score point
warp<00:05:02.370> sky<00:05:03.370> point<00:05:04.290> i'm<00:05:05.290> pretty<00:05:05.620> sure<00:05:05.740> it's<00:05:05.920> just

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
warp sky point i'm pretty sure it's just

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.440 
warp sky point i'm pretty sure it's just
point<00:05:06.490> ah<00:05:08.430> let's<00:05:09.430> go<00:05:09.520> walk<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:10.030> get<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.210> list

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
point ah let's go walk and get the list

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.320 
point ah let's go walk and get the list
for<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.460> sky<00:05:12.730> point<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.290> walk

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
for that and it is sky point to walk

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.740 
for that and it is sky point to walk
skypoint<00:05:17.010> all<00:05:18.010> right<00:05:18.460> now<00:05:19.210> have<00:05:19.420> a<00:05:19.450> look<00:05:19.540> at

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
skypoint all right now have a look at

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.810 
skypoint all right now have a look at
this<00:05:19.840> creation<00:05:20.590> so<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.250> obviously<00:05:21.400> mini

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
this creation so this is obviously mini

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.480 
this creation so this is obviously mini
