00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
let me have a few more sips of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.499 
let me have a few more sips of
industrial<00:01:39.410> waste<00:01:44.860> maybe<00:01:45.860> maybe<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:47.000> can<00:01:47.300> turn

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
industrial waste maybe maybe I can turn

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.050 
industrial waste maybe maybe I can turn
them<00:01:47.750> cancers<00:01:48.259> against<00:01:48.560> one<00:01:48.830> another<00:01:49.190> that's

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
them cancers against one another that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.520 
them cancers against one another that's
what<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.390> got<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.570> hope<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.200> know<00:01:51.320> that

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
what you got a hope for you know that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.290 
what you got a hope for you know that
you<00:01:51.619> get<00:01:51.740> more<00:01:51.950> than<00:01:52.009> one<00:01:52.190> cancer<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.030> they<00:01:53.150> eat

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
you get more than one cancer so they eat

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.870 
you get more than one cancer so they eat
each<00:01:53.330> other<00:01:53.690> up<00:01:53.780> instead<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.759> fact<00:01:55.759> the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
each other up instead of you fact the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.640 
each other up instead of you fact the
way<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.030> look<00:01:56.330> at<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.930> more<00:01:57.080> can<00:01:57.350> see<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650
