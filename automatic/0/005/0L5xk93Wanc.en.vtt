them almost every time and backside 180s

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.580 
them almost every time and backside 180s
you're<00:01:11.729> gonna<00:01:11.910> need<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> learn<00:01:12.360> those<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you're gonna need to learn those and a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're gonna need to learn those and a
lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> people<00:01:14.430> many<00:01:14.700> learned<00:01:14.910> back<00:01:15.060> sideways

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
lot of people many learned back sideways

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620 
lot of people many learned back sideways
they<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.369> half<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
they go with the half way and then a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600 
they go with the half way and then a
little<00:01:18.960> revert<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.649> looks<00:01:20.070> cool<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.399> you<00:01:20.490> can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
little revert it looks cool if you can

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.080 
little revert it looks cool if you can
do<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> recommend<00:01:21.570> learning<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> full<00:01:23.090> pop

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
do but I recommend learning the full pop

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.029 
do but I recommend learning the full pop
180<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:25.080> helps<00:01:25.410> a<00:01:25.500> lot<00:01:25.709> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> trick<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:28.039> the

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
180 it helps a lot in this trick but the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.830 
180 it helps a lot in this trick but the
key<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> reason<00:01:29.970> why<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.690> learn

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
key the reason why you want to learn

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.270 
key the reason why you want to learn
back<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.289> it<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.830> good<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.190> this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
back when it is really good in this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
back when it is really good in this
trick<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.580> because<00:01:33.149> one<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.509> makes<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.810> half

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
trick is because one it makes up half

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.510 
trick is because one it makes up half
the<00:01:34.170> trick<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.640> two<00:01:36.590> we<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.740> back<00:01:37.920> 180s<00:01:38.429> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the trick and two we do back 180s in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.400 
the trick and two we do back 180s in
order<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.819> land<00:01:38.970> them<00:01:39.179> really<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.660> decent

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
order to land them really good decent

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.109 
order to land them really good decent
height<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:41.399> need<00:01:41.429> to<00:01:41.640> keep<00:01:41.789> your<00:01:41.850> back

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
height you need to keep your back

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
height you need to keep your back
straight<00:01:42.149> I'd<00:01:42.990> say<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.319> lot<00:01:43.410> in<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.740> my

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
straight I'd say this a lot in all my

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.949 
straight I'd say this a lot in all my
videos<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.580> lean<00:01:44.910> forward<00:01:45.420> don't<00:01:45.780> lean

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
videos don't lean forward don't lean

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.499 
videos don't lean forward don't lean
back<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.590> straight<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> nice<00:01:48.209> clean

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
back then straight down get a nice clean

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.010 
back then straight down get a nice clean
pop<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.429> back<00:01:50.580> 180<00:01:50.940> because<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.929> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pop and do the back 180 because if you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.249 
pop and do the back 180 because if you
lean<00:01:52.259> forward<00:01:52.289> when<00:01:53.160> you're<00:01:53.340> doing<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
lean forward when you're doing a

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.930 
lean forward when you're doing a
backside<00:01:55.259> flip<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:56.340> most<00:01:56.459> likely<00:01:56.729> going

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
backside flip you're most likely going

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.339 
backside flip you're most likely going

center of the tail that's fine pretty
much<00:02:21.930> set<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.290> back<00:02:22.470> foot<00:02:22.709> however<00:02:23.099> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
much set up your back foot however you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.920 
much set up your back foot however you
would<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.489> back<00:02:23.700> 180<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.360> however<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.780> feel

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
would do a back 180 and however you feel

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.110 
would do a back 180 and however you feel
comfortable<00:02:24.989> with<00:02:25.470> doing<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:26.790> front

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
comfortable with doing it and my front

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.510 
comfortable with doing it and my front
foot<00:02:27.350> my<00:02:28.350> normal<00:02:28.650> kickflip<00:02:29.010> position<00:02:29.400> is

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
foot my normal kickflip position is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.060 
foot my normal kickflip position is
rather<00:02:29.760> flat<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.570> flush<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.050> board<00:02:31.350> but

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
rather flat and flush with the board but

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.140 
rather flat and flush with the board but
when<00:02:32.160> i'm<00:02:32.250> doing<00:02:32.340> backside

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
when i'm doing backside

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
when i'm doing backside
flips<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.659> tend<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.379> angle<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.189> more

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
flips I tend to angle it a little more

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.190 
flips I tend to angle it a little more
and<00:02:35.519> move<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> down<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.360> helps<00:02:36.629> me<00:02:36.750> get<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.019> pop

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
and move it down it helps me get the pop

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
and move it down it helps me get the pop
and<00:02:37.230> flick<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.739> lot<00:02:37.860> more<00:02:38.069> easier<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:39.390> like<00:02:39.720> I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
and flick a lot more easier but like I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
and flick a lot more easier but like I
said<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.110> all<00:02:40.230> preference<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.129> want

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
said it's all preference so if you want

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.800 
said it's all preference so if you want
to<00:02:41.370> try<00:02:41.519> learning<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.879> there<00:02:42.030> first<00:02:42.360> or<00:02:42.629> go

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
to try learning it there first or go

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.030 
to try learning it there first or go
right<00:02:43.019> back<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.379> your<00:02:43.500> regular<00:02:43.739> capable

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
right back to your regular capable

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.280 
right back to your regular capable
position<00:02:44.400> by<00:02:44.579> all<00:02:44.730> means<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.290> it's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
position by all means you can it's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.270 
position by all means you can it's
pretty<00:02:46.470> much<00:02:46.530> wherever<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:47.040> front<00:02:47.250> foot

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
pretty much wherever your front foot

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130 
pretty much wherever your front foot
feels<00:02:47.640> comfortable<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.360> awkward<00:02:48.599> but<00:02:49.019> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
feels comfortable not awkward but is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.699 
feels comfortable not awkward but is
able<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.439> flip<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> board<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> pretty

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
able to flip the board and so pretty

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.890 
able to flip the board and so pretty
much<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.819> key<00:02:54.090> thing<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.599> remember

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
much the key thing you got to remember

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.190 
much the key thing you got to remember
with<00:02:55.590> backside<00:02:56.250> flips<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:57.079> you're<00:02:58.079> not

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
with backside flips is you're not

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.140 
with backside flips is you're not
combined<00:02:58.829> in<00:02:58.980> both<00:02:59.159> motions<00:02:59.519> at<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.970> same

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
combined in both motions at the same

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.839 
combined in both motions at the same
time<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.650> you're<00:03:02.099> pretty<00:03:02.340> much<00:03:02.489> going

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
time it's like you're pretty much going

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.240 
time it's like you're pretty much going
to<00:03:02.909> back<00:03:03.269> 180<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.140> halfway<00:03:04.620> through<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.099> back

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
to back 180 and halfway through the back

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
to back 180 and halfway through the back
180<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:05.790> when<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.060> start<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.389> flick<00:03:06.599> out<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
180 is when you start to flick out the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.080 
180 is when you start to flick out the
board<00:03:07.019> for<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> kickflip<00:03:07.849> that's<00:03:08.849> how<00:03:08.970> you're

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
board for the kickflip that's how you're

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.160 
board for the kickflip that's how you're
going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.269> land<00:03:09.420> them<00:03:09.510> nice<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.019> nice

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
going to land them nice and get a nice

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.379 
going to land them nice and get a nice
pop<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.799> laying<00:03:11.370> them<00:03:11.459> fairly<00:03:11.819> easy<00:03:12.120> it's

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
pop and laying them fairly easy it's

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.819 
pop and laying them fairly easy it's
weird<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.900> explain<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.459> really<00:03:14.970> easy<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
weird to explain but it's really easy to

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.670 
weird to explain but it's really easy to
mentally<00:03:18.170> associate<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.409> when<00:03:19.560> you're

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
mentally associate with when you're

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.710 
mentally associate with when you're
doing<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:19.980> trick<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.250> say<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:21.269> you're<00:03:21.629> gonna

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
doing the trick to say so you're gonna

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.530 
doing the trick to say so you're gonna
pop<00:03:22.250> if<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.400> would<00:03:23.579> with<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> regular<00:03:23.879> ollier

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
pop if you would with a regular ollier

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.479 
pop if you would with a regular ollier
kick<00:03:24.810> flipper<00:03:25.170> backside<00:03:25.590> 180<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.099> this<00:03:26.250> case

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
kick flipper backside 180 in this case

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.830 
kick flipper backside 180 in this case
and<00:03:27.049> when<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.079> board<00:03:28.379> gets<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:29.040> hear

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
and when the board gets about to hear

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.530 
and when the board gets about to hear
like<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.170> little<00:03:31.590> bit<00:03:31.709> before<00:03:31.829> half<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.540> that's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
like a little bit before half way that's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.229 
like a little bit before half way that's
when<00:03:33.780> your<00:03:33.900> front<00:03:34.230> foot<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:35.459> going<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.819> flick

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
when your front foot is going to flick

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.970 
when your front foot is going to flick
off<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:37.079> board<00:03:37.489> causing<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.669> to<00:03:38.879> kick<00:03:39.660> foot

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
off the board causing it to kick foot

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.080 
off the board causing it to kick foot
and<00:03:40.980> also<00:03:41.280> making<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.760> 180<00:03:42.090> 180<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:44.699> lot

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and also making the 180 180 so I a lot

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.720 
and also making the 180 180 so I a lot
easier<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> that's<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.220> key<00:03:47.430> thing<00:03:47.459> to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
easier so that's the key thing to

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.759 
easier so that's the key thing to
remember<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.389> trick<00:03:48.629> at<00:03:48.840> all<00:03:48.900> times<00:03:49.470> is

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
remember with this trick at all times is

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.729 
remember with this trick at all times is
to<00:03:50.430> pop<00:03:50.819> get<00:03:51.389> halfway<00:03:51.659> and<00:03:52.139> then<00:03:52.199> flick<00:03:52.560> out

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
to pop get halfway and then flick out

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.089 
to pop get halfway and then flick out
because<00:03:53.639> if<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.060> pop<00:03:54.449> and<00:03:54.780> flick<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.889> try<00:03:56.040> and

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
because if you pop and flick and try and

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.460 
because if you pop and flick and try and
smit<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.489> same<00:03:56.669> time<00:03:56.909> it's<00:03:57.480> two<00:03:57.720> motions<00:03:57.959> your

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
smit the same time it's two motions your

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.500 
smit the same time it's two motions your
feet<00:03:58.680> are<00:03:58.829> going<00:03:58.949> to<00:03:59.040> go<00:03:59.159> crisscrossing<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
feet are going to go crisscrossing and

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.819 
feet are going to go crisscrossing and
you're<00:04:00.780> not<00:04:00.870> going<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.079> land<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.409> really<00:04:01.650> good

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
you're not going to land it really good

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.530 
you're not going to land it really good
or<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.220> gonna<00:04:02.280> be<00:04:02.459> really<00:04:02.579> sloppy<00:04:02.970> or<00:04:03.299> really

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
or it's gonna be really sloppy or really

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.930 
or it's gonna be really sloppy or really
bad<00:04:03.659> or<00:04:03.720> whatever<00:04:04.129> so<00:04:05.129> just<00:04:05.519> remember<00:04:05.669> that

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
bad or whatever so just remember that

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.149 
bad or whatever so just remember that
you<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.209> pop<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.900> when<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.169> feel<00:04:07.440> your<00:04:07.590> back

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
you can pop and when you feel your back

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.860 
you can pop and when you feel your back
like<00:04:08.639> tail<00:04:08.970> leave<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.359> ground<00:04:09.599> when<00:04:09.780> you're

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
like tail leave the ground when you're

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.869 
like tail leave the ground when you're
doing<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.109> 180<00:04:10.409> that's<00:04:11.069> pretty<00:04:11.519> much<00:04:11.669> when

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
doing the 180 that's pretty much when

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.689 
doing the 180 that's pretty much when
you're<00:04:11.940> gonna<00:04:12.060> flick<00:04:12.329> out<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:14.069> that's<00:04:14.639> really

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
you're gonna flick out and that's really

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.029 
you're gonna flick out and that's really
at<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.060> backside<00:04:15.419> flips<00:04:15.720> um<00:04:16.049> keep<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:16.859> mind

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
at the backside flips um keep in mind

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.300 
at the backside flips um keep in mind
that<00:04:17.159> this<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.729> fairly<00:04:18.530> hard<00:04:19.530> trick<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.159> get

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
that this is a fairly hard trick to get

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.110 
that this is a fairly hard trick to get
down<00:04:20.549> because<00:04:21.889> with<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:22.979> kickflip<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
down because with the kickflip and the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.000 
down because with the kickflip and the
backside<00:04:24.690> flip<00:04:24.900> it's<00:04:25.050> very<00:04:25.320> easy<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.710> lean

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
backside flip it's very easy to lean

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.330 
backside flip it's very easy to lean
forward

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
forward

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.030 
forward
out<00:04:27.550> from<00:04:27.760> underneath<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.770> recommend

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
out from underneath you so I recommend

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.100 
out from underneath you so I recommend
not<00:04:30.400> living<00:04:30.699> near<00:04:30.910> extreme<00:04:31.240> lots<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.690> cars<00:04:31.900> go

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
not living near extreme lots of cars go

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.900 
not living near extreme lots of cars go
by<00:04:32.169> because<00:04:32.530> I've<00:04:32.889> had<00:04:33.070> my<00:04:33.220> board<00:04:33.460> run<00:04:33.639> over

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
by because I've had my board run over

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.120 
by because I've had my board run over
and<00:04:34.090> I<00:04:34.150> tried<00:04:34.360> learning<00:04:34.540> these<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.470> there's<00:04:36.040> a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
and I tried learning these so there's a

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.520 
and I tried learning these so there's a
little<00:04:36.220> key<00:04:36.550> tip<00:04:36.760> for<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.350> that's<00:04:38.350> about

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
little key tip for you and that's about

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.370 
little key tip for you and that's about
it<00:04:38.680> um<00:04:39.330> remember<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.510> practice<00:04:40.690> practice

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
it um remember to practice practice

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.200 
it um remember to practice practice
practice<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.949> these<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.430> don't<00:04:42.760> get<00:04:42.910> mad<00:04:43.060> at

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
practice with these and don't get mad at

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.370 
practice with these and don't get mad at
them<00:04:43.360> because<00:04:43.389> they<00:04:43.690> do<00:04:43.750> take<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.020> while<00:04:44.229> to

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
them because they do take a while to

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.200 
them because they do take a while to
come<00:04:44.560> some<00:04:45.310> people<00:04:45.340> think<00:04:45.729> it<00:04:45.850> up<00:04:45.970> with<00:04:46.090> like

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
come some people think it up with like

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.820 
come some people think it up with like
four<00:04:46.419> tries<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.990> probably<00:04:47.320> get<00:04:47.530> my<00:04:47.620> laundry

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
four tries the probably get my laundry

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.129 
four tries the probably get my laundry
dries<00:04:48.130> is<00:04:48.400> this<00:04:48.610> on<00:04:49.419> your<00:04:49.479> ability<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:52.139> grasp

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
dries is this on your ability to grasp

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.490 
dries is this on your ability to grasp
the<00:04:53.410> concept<00:04:53.919> of<00:04:53.979> how<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.160> do<00:04:54.400> fairly<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:56.110> like

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
the concept of how to do fairly and like

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.980 
the concept of how to do fairly and like
I<00:04:56.530> said<00:04:56.710> like<00:04:57.030> don't<00:04:58.030> be<00:04:58.540> one<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.720> those<00:04:58.810> we've

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
I said like don't be one of those we've

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.870 
I said like don't be one of those we've
learned<00:04:59.470> how<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.710> do<00:04:59.860> a<00:04:59.889> kickflip<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.639> it's

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
learned how to do a kickflip and it's

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.909 
learned how to do a kickflip and it's
very<00:05:01.120> sloppy<00:05:01.510> you've<00:05:02.020> landed<00:05:02.200> like<00:05:02.440> three<00:05:02.800> of

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
very sloppy you've landed like three of

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.770 
very sloppy you've landed like three of
them<00:05:03.100> get<00:05:03.669> your<00:05:03.850> kick<00:05:04.060> flips<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.479> your<00:05:04.600> back

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
them get your kick flips and your back

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.510 
them get your kick flips and your back
180s<00:05:05.350> down<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:05.889> trick<00:05:06.220> should<00:05:06.430> be

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
180s down and this trick should be

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.280 
180s down and this trick should be
fairly<00:05:06.790> simple<00:05:07.270> for<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.630> understand<00:05:08.110> and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
fairly simple for you to understand and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.500 
fairly simple for you to understand and
get<00:05:08.380> down<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:10.590> think<00:05:11.590> that's<00:05:11.889> about<00:05:12.010> it

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
get down and I think that's about it

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.500 
get down and I think that's about it
troubleshooting<00:05:13.510> for<00:05:13.720> this<00:05:13.840> trick<00:05:14.080> would<00:05:14.290> be

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
troubleshooting for this trick would be

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.070 
troubleshooting for this trick would be
landing<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:17.820> guess<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.970> landing<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.630> full<00:05:19.870> thing

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
landing I guess I landing the full thing

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.230 
landing I guess I landing the full thing
and<00:05:20.440> screaming<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.039> board<00:05:21.250> out<00:05:21.460> doesn't<00:05:22.210> mean

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
and screaming the board out doesn't mean

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.090 
and screaming the board out doesn't mean
you're<00:05:22.450> leaning<00:05:22.750> forward<00:05:23.169> too<00:05:23.320> much<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:23.950> when

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
you're leaning forward too much so when

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.710 
you're leaning forward too much so when
you're<00:05:24.220> landing<00:05:24.400> your<00:05:24.669> kind<00:05:24.910> of<00:05:25.000> swing<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.539> one

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
you're landing your kind of swing to one

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.170 
you're landing your kind of swing to one
side<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.199> you're<00:05:26.650> off<00:05:26.830> balance<00:05:27.070> so<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.000> member

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
side and you're off balance so I member

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.150 
side and you're off balance so I member
to<00:05:28.300> bend<00:05:28.630> straight<00:05:29.080> down<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.620> pop<00:05:29.830> straight

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
to bend straight down and pop straight

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.529 
to bend straight down and pop straight
up<00:05:32.160> another<00:05:33.160> problem<00:05:33.850> in<00:05:33.970> this<00:05:34.030> trick<00:05:34.300> I<00:05:34.389> could

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
up another problem in this trick I could

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.320 
up another problem in this trick I could
maybe<00:05:34.720> see<00:05:35.020> is<00:05:35.820> actually<00:05:36.820> yeah<00:05:37.120> this<00:05:37.150> is

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
maybe see is actually yeah this is

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.629 
maybe see is actually yeah this is
pretty<00:05:37.479> common<00:05:37.780> is<00:05:38.410> if<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.860> flip<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
pretty common is if you flip it and the

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.120 
pretty common is if you flip it and the
board<00:05:39.880> goes<00:05:40.090> like<00:05:40.270> out<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:40.870> here<00:05:41.139> and<00:05:41.650> you're

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
board goes like out to here and you're

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.260 
board goes like out to here and you're
back<00:05:42.370> here<00:05:42.700> um<00:05:44.460> like<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.580> said<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.880> remember

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
back here um like I said to remember

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.570 
back here um like I said to remember
it's<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.080> pop<00:05:47.620> straight<00:05:47.889> down<00:05:48.160> that's<00:05:48.430> half

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
it's the pop straight down that's half

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.550 
it's the pop straight down that's half
the<00:05:48.610> problem<00:05:48.760> and<00:05:49.660> your<00:05:49.780> second<00:05:50.110> problem<00:05:50.289> is

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
the problem and your second problem is

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.219 
the problem and your second problem is
you're<00:05:50.800> not<00:05:50.830> looking<00:05:51.669> out<00:05:51.910> half<00:05:52.780> way<00:05:52.810> when<00:05:53.139> the

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
you're not looking out half way when the

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.690 
you're not looking out half way when the
board<00:05:53.410> rotates<00:05:53.770> because<00:05:54.099> if<00:05:54.280> you're<00:05:54.460> flicking
