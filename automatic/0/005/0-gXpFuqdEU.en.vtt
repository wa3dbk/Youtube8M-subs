but let's go back to our normal view and
that's<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:31.209> very<00:03:31.390> simple<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:35.530> this

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that's it it it's very simple now this

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.929 
that's it it it's very simple now this
is<00:03:35.829> interesting<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.549> see<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.760> inside

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
is interesting you get to see the inside

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.030 
is interesting you get to see the inside
of<00:03:37.180> some<00:03:37.689> houses<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.469> can<00:03:38.650> maybe<00:03:38.799> only

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
of some houses that you can maybe only

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.750 
of some houses that you can maybe only
what<00:03:39.609> do<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.760> see<00:03:40.030> from<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.389> outside<00:03:41.760> let's

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
what do I see from the outside let's

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.030 
what do I see from the outside let's
refresh<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.569> see<00:03:43.780> did<00:03:43.989> find<00:03:44.260> any<00:03:44.379> closer<00:03:44.709> for

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
refresh you see did find any closer for
