00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.330
 Welcome to YOULOAD 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.720
 we are here in our siege Smash them 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.659
 on the design will percent before the first penalty instance 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.560
 the little battle he's watching is Crash Pug 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.179
 just before the bus 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.259
 because the two colossi in the background are also dead 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.589
 the Firmlinge breaks through the gate by hand and ported this large behind us 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.819
 sealed so the 4 are included in this area 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.349
 All players must first meet with their vehicles and with them 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.610
 arrive 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.770
 and the standard of being killed at Kunduz 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.230
 how a battle "train over itself can see on the left are 25 men 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.440
 Raid for this we have Case 4 Siege Weapons for those five 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.530
 Missed about two persecutors money 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.559
 what you take is relatively free 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.150
 and is not mandatory on this underground 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.810
 only important is that we have one or two shoppers with one person each 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.890
 are busy and can distribute it until behind 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.050
 of the other vehicles are also MÃ¼nster two each 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.380
 exist 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.020
 so that the individual roles are fulfilled 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.900
 we could see that the flame lamppost therefore come pure and the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.960
 The fight starts as soon as a fight is based on a very simple strategy 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.030
 this is that the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.780
 current goal of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.710
 in flames over there simply distance ahead of this runs similar to the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.910
 Coulin looked from rank three followed that still knows 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.920
 that is a randomly selected player 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.200
 So gets a Leader share over his vehicle 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.650
 and then goes off accordingly for 30 seconds from the flames 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.110
 after exactly 30 seconds the target changes 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 and a second player is tracked 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.369
 the current patch is primarily planning-related and 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.200
 referred before 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.670
 which are the slowest 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.790
 the vehicles are 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.360
 and 2 and thus have the hardest to get away from him anyway 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 with sufficient distance to give 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.360
 do not pose a problem 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.770
 Both the windows and Blaguss machines floodlit the driver 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.519
 were introduced 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.799
 In our case Hochtief, the Kosor also had the task here 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.639
 that foxes an application folder rail 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.079
 these pictures and profiles can fire with rockets in the air and with 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.349
 Grenades could see more forward 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.229
 When sweetened as it behaves similarly 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.499
 So all players can fire while watching the Leviathan 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.989
 But attack does not do that much damage before me 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.079
 second tactic 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.559
 because we can see the protection of the surface machinery 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.399
 not all yet fired from the air by Turid better on the ground 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:45.259
 land 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:50.679
 which misses from the protection of one that in turn can be collected and 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.879
 then I can refer to it without being referenced 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.389
 as soon as the board is there, the driver can point that out 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.519
 who set the troop on fire at 8 7 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.150
 if the mud is never pulled there thereafter 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.389
 suffers the considerable damage 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.099
 Danny should be no problem then the Leviathan in the Easy 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.129
 To cheat fashion 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.299
 For the well fought also another option 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.479
 because more and more women can do it 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.889
 but you have to park in advance ready at least four players 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.569
 the one on the foot had previously taken fifth place among these 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.829
 Players should have a healer and Ralf Henn fighter 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.159
 the players can then be protected in the 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.599
 that relegated the loading while driving and the driver of the VW is that 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.629
 Then she can close Gruber on the stove 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.279
 Once there, they can destroy the kicks and then the brakes 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.489
 to step 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.189
 This has two advantages, one could be the Leviathan directly 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.590
 to come to a standstill in the fire causing immense damage and to 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.919
 to change 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.129
 that reduces a viable speed the longer the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.929
 Leviathan drives through the area 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.380
 the faster it gets 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.630
 and that means that the goodwill of the vehicles in any case 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.149
 Face when he is haunted 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.409
 but as I said for the local place, you do not necessarily have to do that 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.500
 instead of the four players he would place on the windows I could 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.430
 also easy 2 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.510
 Vehicles take more and thus the judges open 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.820
 By the way, the Simor launched here in the sea instance entrance 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.530
 bring Ron Hubbard, however, Brady talks to the Keeper of the teachings of 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.610
 Organon is such a ghost 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.979
 Fritz Amann clear 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.400
 then you are automatically in Hartmut 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.669
 for this you can then before 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.110
 also the four best 2 0 TSI and way 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.999
 destroy three of them to reduce the level of difficulty 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.189
 but we come to a hospital in the video
