 fall into error 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.699

 from the front track 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:41.399
 or even the moment it locks the stopwatch covers itself numbered and also 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.329
 this can lead to error 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.939
 step we send the judges recognizing the great commitment that they put us in 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.939
