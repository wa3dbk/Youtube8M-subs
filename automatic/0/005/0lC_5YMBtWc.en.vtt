00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.830 
out with like a test shot so I just
usually<00:01:45.619> take<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.009> just<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.780> get<00:01:47.780> an

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
usually take it just so I can get an

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.200 
usually take it just so I can get an
idea<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.200> how<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.470> lighting<00:01:48.740> is

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.730 

so<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> first<00:01:54.600> test<00:01:54.810> shot<00:01:55.020> wasn't<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.560> bad

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so the first test shot wasn't so bad

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.190 
so the first test shot wasn't so bad
actually

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually
Lighting's<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.440> good<00:01:59.270> swing<00:02:00.270> something

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
Lighting's pretty good swing something

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.850 
Lighting's pretty good swing something
like<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.320> yeah

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
like that yeah

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
like that yeah
so<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.460> give<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.760> model<00:02:02.910> some<00:02:03.120> kind

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so you want to give the model some kind

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.060 
so you want to give the model some kind
of<00:02:03.690> direction<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.890> want<00:02:05.010> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
of direction but you don't want to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
of direction but you don't want to
direct<00:02:05.280> her<00:02:05.400> too<00:02:05.580> much<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.960> usually

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
direct her too much so I just usually

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
direct her too much so I just usually
