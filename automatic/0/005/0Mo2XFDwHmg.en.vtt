00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello friends I have told many 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 about gi substrate methods but growing 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.670
 but today I will show you the types of substrate and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.509
 secrets of his preparation of the substrate 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.650
 can be divided into nutritious and empty 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.420
 empty or inert substrate 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 used in some hydroponic 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.680
 systems, but I will stop in more detail 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 it is on the nutrient substrate first 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.920
 decide on the pot it can be 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.369
 plastic buckets 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.710
 basins either flower pots or 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.280
 I personally grow fabric pots 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 I recommend it and they are also 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.790
 like plastic 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.219
 but the process is better in them and 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 air exchange and drainage and most importantly 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.870
 in the tomb of the gods there is aerial 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.370
 trimming the roots and it increases 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 yield only minus 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.760
 fabric pots is fast 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.320
 drying of the substrate 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 it is therefore important to monitor the level 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.090
 humidity now want to share with you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.399
 my recipe for substrate preparation 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 I will say at once recipes as components 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.260
 very many each picks up their 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 needs and type of plants the main thing is that in the morning 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.510
 should have the following qualities 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 be breathable retain moisture 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 and fertilizer 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.680
 and then give them to the plant I 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.509
 will tell 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 universal formula for all types 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.970
 plants first i will pour coconut 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 briquette 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.250
 water while he entertains I mix 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.689
 earth with perlite and vermiculite 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 some add only vermiculite 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.759
 to increase the moisture content of the substrate 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.920
 perlite also makes these airy substrates 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.439
 supplements are not necessary but 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.329
 superfluous certainly not when coconut 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.140
 sufficiently absorbed the moisture we 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:50.610
 get it out of the bucket and mix it in the ground 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.180
 mix the coconut well with our land 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.670
 substrate 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.600
 ready in such a substrate is necessary 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.760
 nutrients 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 so the first time the plants can 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.770
 pour clean water on the empty substrate 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.900
 fertilizer is applied continuously on the map 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.950
 feeding hydroponics is important to maintain 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.930
 substrate page 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 especially after fertilization 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.520
 page substrate indicators are in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.620
 from 6 to six and a half in 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.569
 depending on the stage of your plant and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.730
 so the three basic rules of good 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.170
 substrate substrate should be good 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.200
 absorb and release moisture 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.380
 have good breathability and have 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.950
 correct ph level of success at home 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.950
 growing
