Tessa had a lot of lines to her hair and
this<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.020> just<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.740> first<00:04:41.270> application<00:04:42.270> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
this is just the first application that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.320 
this is just the first application that
we<00:04:42.900> used<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.650> we<00:04:44.190> eliminated<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.090> lines

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
we used and we eliminated the lines

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.950 
we used and we eliminated the lines
because<00:04:45.870> we<00:04:46.080> can<00:04:46.320> isolate<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:47.700> root<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.390> as

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
because we can isolate the root and as

00:04:48.960 --> 00:05:17.920 
because we can isolate the root and as
you<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.290> see<00:04:49.530> once<00:04:50.040> again<00:04:50.190> it's<00:04:50.730> seamless

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930
