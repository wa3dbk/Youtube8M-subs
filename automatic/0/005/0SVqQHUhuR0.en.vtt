00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.700 
give a review about the irulu here it is
you<00:00:23.759> could<00:00:23.909> turn<00:00:24.089> it<00:00:24.239> this<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.419> if<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.349> see

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you could turn it this way if you see

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.339 
you could turn it this way if you see
you<00:00:25.919> could<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.729> reflection<00:00:26.909> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.839> mean<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
you could see my reflection so I mean I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.630 
you could see my reflection so I mean I
guess<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.710> kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> works<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> could

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
guess it kind of works but you could

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.479 
guess it kind of works but you could
turn<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.909> sideways<00:00:30.149> you<00:00:30.599> could<00:00:30.720> turn<00:00:30.839> it<00:00:30.989> up

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
turn it sideways you could turn it up

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
turn it sideways you could turn it up
upward<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.420> basically<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.440> like

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
upward like that but basically it's like

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.660 
upward like that but basically it's like
a<00:00:34.590> generic<00:00:35.040> iPad<00:00:35.490> um<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:38.370> works

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
