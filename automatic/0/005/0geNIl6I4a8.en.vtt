Whitney Young magnet school that's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.990

actually where Michelle Obama went to
school<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:25.109> first<00:00:25.350> thought<00:00:25.529> he'd<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
school so I at first thought he'd be a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
school so I at first thought he'd be a
great<00:00:26.279> fit<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> Milwaukee<00:00:27.029> Bucks

great fit with the Milwaukee Bucks

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
great fit with the Milwaukee Bucks
because<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:27.990> kind<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:28.980> bit

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
because they kind of have a little bit

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
because they kind of have a little bit
of<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.429> neat<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.789> center<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.590> he<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:31.859> have

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
of a neat at center and he they have

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.680 
of a neat at center and he they have
shot<00:00:32.250> block<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> four<00:00:33.270> with

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
shot block in there at the four with

shot block in there at the four with
John<00:00:33.899> Henson<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.829> thought<00:00:35.190> he'd<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> good

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
John Henson so I thought he'd be a good

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060 
John Henson so I thought he'd be a good
fit<00:00:35.940> he<00:00:36.180> lives<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.540> near<00:00:37.020> Milwaukee<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
Chicago shibari partners from Chicago

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and went to do so I thought that'd be

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
and went to do so I thought that'd be
good<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.960> him<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.800> anyway<00:00:44.070> he<00:00:44.250> measured<00:00:44.550> at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
good for him but anyway he measured at

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.889 
good for him but anyway he measured at
611<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.649> 75<00:00:47.340> wingspan<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.329> last<00:00:48.539> time<00:00:48.750> he

611 and a 75 wingspan the last time he

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
611 and a 75 wingspan the last time he
was<00:00:49.050> measured<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:50.010> maybe<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> hoop

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789

free<00:01:44.759> throw<00:01:45.000> shooting<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:46.049> bad<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
free throw shooting was really bad as

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
free throw shooting was really bad as
you<00:01:47.009> saw<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> tournament<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.000> he<00:01:48.540> kind<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you saw in the tournament and he kind of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.950 
you saw in the tournament and he kind of
struggles<00:01:49.290> defending<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.540> with<00:01:51.540> effort

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
struggles defending in with effort

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.920 
struggles defending in with effort
sometimes<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.909> hurt<00:01:54.270> his<00:01:54.420> draft<00:01:54.600> stock

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
sometimes so that's hurt his draft stock

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
sometimes so that's hurt his draft stock
a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> his<00:01:56.490> tendencies<00:01:57.030> right

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
a little bit and his tendencies right

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.230 
a little bit and his tendencies right
here<00:01:57.860> I'll<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.130> talk<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.579> comparison

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
here I'll just talk about a comparison

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.660 
here I'll just talk about a comparison
that<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.750> use

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
that I use

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.870 
that I use
for<00:02:02.330> his<00:02:02.630> tendencies<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.290> made<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.680> blend<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.400> did

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
for his tendencies I made a blend I did

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.030 
for his tendencies I made a blend I did
the<00:02:05.060> tendencies<00:02:05.509> as<00:02:05.689> like<00:02:05.900> a<00:02:05.930> blend<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.590> Al

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
the tendencies as like a blend of Al

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.940 
the tendencies as like a blend of Al
Jefferson<00:02:07.430> Tim<00:02:08.390> Duncan<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.110> DeMarcus

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
Jefferson Tim Duncan and DeMarcus

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.620 
Jefferson Tim Duncan and DeMarcus
Cousins<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.759> thought<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.090> worked<00:02:11.450> out

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
Cousins so I thought that worked out

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.080 
Cousins so I thought that worked out
pretty<00:02:11.690> well<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.500> here's<00:02:13.400> his<00:02:13.580> signature

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
pretty well and here's his signature

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.530 
pretty well and here's his signature
right<00:02:14.330> here<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:15.319> his<00:02:15.950> signature<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.790> did<00:02:17.330> look

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
right here so his signature I did look

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.470 
right here so his signature I did look
at<00:02:17.750> his<00:02:18.080> actual<00:02:18.650> jump<00:02:19.040> shot<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:20.209> pretty

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
at his actual jump shot and it's pretty

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.620 
at his actual jump shot and it's pretty
smooth<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:23.000> few<00:02:23.030> years<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
smooth and I think in a few years in the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.420 
smooth and I think in a few years in the
leak<00:02:23.840> he'll<00:02:24.170> be<00:02:24.290> able<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.530> develop<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.130> jump

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
leak he'll be able to develop that jump

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.650 
leak he'll be able to develop that jump
shot<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.940> know<00:02:26.030> he<00:02:26.180> doesn't<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.630> it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
shot you know he doesn't have it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.259 
shot you know he doesn't have it
consistently<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.739> mid-range<00:02:27.920> right<00:02:28.370> now<00:02:28.580> but

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
consistently for mid-range right now but

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.180 
consistently for mid-range right now but
in<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.630> couple<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.989> years<00:02:30.050> down<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.530> road<00:02:30.560> it'll

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
in a couple of years down the road it'll

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.040 
in a couple of years down the road it'll
be<00:02:31.280> nice<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.790> think<00:02:32.180> it'll<00:02:32.360> look<00:02:32.480> good<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.900> him

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
be nice I think it'll look good for him

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.449 
be nice I think it'll look good for him
so<00:02:33.860> yeah<00:02:34.459> that's<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:36.190> now<00:02:37.190> let<00:02:37.340> me<00:02:37.370> just

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.970 
so yeah that's that now let me just
talked<00:02:37.760> about<00:02:38.030> his<00:02:38.209> badges<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:38.720> too<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.500> like

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
end up going to as New York although

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.009 
end up going to as New York although
their<00:03:35.150> defense<00:03:35.870> would<00:03:36.190> suffer<00:03:37.190> immensely

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
their defense would suffer immensely

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.979 
their defense would suffer immensely
also<00:03:39.019> if<00:03:39.320> they're<00:03:39.820> Timberwolves<00:03:40.820> you<00:03:41.359> know<00:03:41.480> if

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
also if they're Timberwolves you know if

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.020 
also if they're Timberwolves you know if
they<00:03:42.200> did<00:03:42.560> something<00:03:42.829> with<00:03:43.070> Pekovic<00:03:43.700> if<00:03:43.910> they

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
they did something with Pekovic if they

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.699 
they did something with Pekovic if they
decide<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.540> trade<00:03:44.870> him<00:03:45.079> because<00:03:45.380> he's<00:03:45.530> been

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
decide to trade him because he's been

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.530 
decide to trade him because he's been
dealing<00:03:45.829> with<00:03:46.010> nagging<00:03:46.519> injuries<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.180> they

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
dealing with nagging injuries and they

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.300 
dealing with nagging injuries and they
started<00:03:47.870> gorgey<00:03:48.260> dang<00:03:48.440> at<00:03:48.620> before<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.010> also

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
started gorgey dang at before I also

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.849 
started gorgey dang at before I also
think<00:03:49.609> that'd<00:03:49.819> be<00:03:50.000> very<00:03:50.030> interesting<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
think that'd be very interesting the

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.590 
think that'd be very interesting the
Lakers<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.579> don't<00:03:52.880> think<00:03:53.060> he's<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
Lakers I don't think he's going to the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.509 
Lakers I don't think he's going to the
Lakers<00:03:53.959> because<00:03:54.290> Julius<00:03:54.799> Randle<00:03:55.190> doesn't

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
Lakers because Julius Randle doesn't

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.640 
Lakers because Julius Randle doesn't
protect<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.910> rim<00:03:56.120> either<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.810> most<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.500> his

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
protect the rim either and most of his

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.920 
protect the rim either and most of his
offensive<00:03:57.980> game<00:03:58.160> relies<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.090> him<00:03:59.569> being<00:03:59.750> in

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
offensive game relies on him being in

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.170 
offensive game relies on him being in
the<00:04:00.019> paint<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.889> yeah<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:01.670> don't<00:04:01.880> think<00:04:02.090> he's

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180
