00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 welcome to the lane stretches 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.440
 remember that both of the lane is for 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.899
 share with the three best 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.130
 champions to go in single club 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.019
 solo qualifiers there will be a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 champion chosen by the subscribers the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.630
 which is decided by a vote in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.429
 facebook and on twitter 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.080
 This vote was initiated when a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 new patch and some have 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
 rpp draw or some video game 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 we started a top and the first low of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 this smoke patch there is someone who should leave 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.650
 his third place for rallies this leaves 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 a second free position and second place 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.360
 would be busy if now 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.280
 he wants he has put the batteries and returns 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.469
 to this podium again he is a champion 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.809
 keep in mind when going alone 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.629
 on the other hand bukom remains as the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.070
 master of the lane in top ride is also 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.590
 maintains as the champion of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 subscribers ok now we move to the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 jungle where he looked where he abandons that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 third place and yield to word 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.199
 week a friendlier champion at the time 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 of making jungle hamburg stays in 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.850
 the second place and branches continues as the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 master of the lane in jungle leasing also 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.610
 he remains as the champion of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.739
 subscribers 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.170
 now we pass on to those of the changes not 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.940
 they have allowed themselves to see everything remains the same 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.280
 Katharina is still the master of the lane 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.740
 in mid although the lower leagues ar and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.050
 I could observe the first place you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 what the sub-sectors say 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.590
 have decided to change yasuo as the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 champion of the subscribers and now the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.820
 new champion of the subscribers is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 eric this the truth is a surprise 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 I expected to see yasuo but I think the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.690
 subscribers have been able to see teach in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.460
 youtube I'm glad it's the turn of the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.500
 stands here yes we have had 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 changes the first change is for lion to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.750
 who to leave the third place and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.460
 leave for area are currently being 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.610
 pretty strong if they have the opportunity 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.380
 to choose area do it and nobody 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 leave second place and now what 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.479
 would take morgan to fault finally morgana 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 is degraded from office and his reign as 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.180
 master of the lane has finished the new 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.100
 lane model for support is jana jean 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 in these moments it provides much more 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.300
 utility and more when in the team 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 enemy this grass or leasing 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 on the other hand lion to abandon his 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.850
 put as the champion of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.310
 subscribers why 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.209
 morgana is the new champion of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.530
 subscribers and finally the ads 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.840
 probably this part is the subject of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.450
 discussion in the comments we'll see 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.640
 to make things easier and for 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.319
 the nerves in this patch we're going to 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.690
 erase everything to the fuck all of the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.150
 podium and since it's clean we started 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.020
 by the beginning the third place is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.010
 for tristan to if it's dreaming took away the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.850
 crown the second place is for york and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.069
 obviously he took advantage of the blacks and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.769
 finally the new master of the lane for 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.280
 Make your bets make the bets 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.980
 desire 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.670
 to see if Latinas the new rail 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.250
 to say it's hicks after the nerds 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 Lucian and tristana yq has become 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.810
 extremely strong compared to 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.000
 how is it because right now some others 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.090
 ads were also increased in the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.489
 list but these are pretty 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.019
 balanced for the moment the champion 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.840
 of the subscribers has also changed 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 so he tristana must leave 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980
 and the new champion of the destroyers 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.810
 is advertised here and if they have 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.280
 disappointed a bit I think not 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.470
 they knew how to see is to generate faith in light 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.750
 that although it is not very big changes its 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.550
 performance these have been the masters of 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.790
 lane you have to remember that this top of 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.500
 champions is to play in solo q 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.510
 solo qualifiers this is not 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.610
 a viable composition to play as 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.500
 team is likely to change your top 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.090
 little by the patches that stripes could 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.610
 be however in the next chapter 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.120
 we will be up to date luck and until the 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.379
 next 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.379
 chao chao
