00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
treating it more like a deadlift and

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.000 
treating it more like a deadlift and
you're<00:03:08.930> pulling<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.350> off<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.470> ground<00:03:09.739> really

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010

so<00:03:22.310> that's<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.579> first<00:03:22.760> mistake<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.540> little

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
so that's the first mistake and a little

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.580 
so that's the first mistake and a little
fix<00:03:24.500> for<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.890> yeah<00:03:25.690> once<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.170> get<00:03:27.440> the

fix for you yeah once we do get the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.860 
fix for you yeah once we do get the
barbell<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.400> knees<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.209> next<00:03:29.690> biggest

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
barbell to the knees the next biggest

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.380 
barbell to the knees the next biggest
mistake<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.500> off<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.829> seat<00:03:31.070> it's<00:03:31.760> early<00:03:32.150> arm

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
mistake that off the seat it's early arm

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.440 
mistake that off the seat it's early arm
bends<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:32.840> we're<00:03:32.989> trying<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:34.070> muscle<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
bends so we're trying to muscle the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.690 
bends so we're trying to muscle the
weight<00:03:35.660> overhead<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.470> before<00:03:37.280> we<00:03:37.370> let<00:03:37.549> that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
weight overhead so before we let that

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.840 
weight overhead so before we let that
Hicks<00:03:37.940> do<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.239> work<00:03:38.680> oftentimes<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:40.250> see

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.920 
over here not muscle in that bar up as
high<00:05:25.070> as<00:05:25.130> we<00:05:25.340> can<00:05:25.370> we<00:05:26.150> got<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.330> start<00:05:26.570> dropping

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
once we get that bar to the hips bars

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.350 
once we get that bar to the hips bars
moving<00:05:36.530> up<00:05:36.800> we<00:05:37.370> want<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.669> drop<00:05:37.850> underneath<00:05:38.180> the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
underneath the bar it's going to allow

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.770 
underneath the bar it's going to allow
us<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.140> do<00:05:45.950> more<00:05:46.100> weight<00:05:46.340> plus<00:05:46.729> it's<00:05:47.540> going<00:05:47.660> to

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
us to do more weight plus it's going to

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.540 
us to do more weight plus it's going to
make<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.020> movement<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.160> lot<00:05:49.370> faster<00:05:49.880> okay<00:05:50.260> so
