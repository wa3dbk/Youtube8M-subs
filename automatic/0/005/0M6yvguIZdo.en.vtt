00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.840

 just very nice 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.870
 and it's a taupe color, I think 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.370
 easy to combine 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.170

 often visible as a type of blezer and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.540
 I really like that one 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.620

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.780

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.150
 beautiful turquoise one of my favorites 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.080
 is the same model as team pink 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.210
 another search for model 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.730
 what falls longer say but this is also 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.890
 a very nice jacket with blue and white black 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.850
 shades in it so again a bit of 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.090
 that hunt knit 80a brooklyn material and 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.300
 it is very nicely fitted 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.860
 will find music and so and yes shop grime 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.900
 and I think this is mine 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.510
 favorite jacket is this one of the week 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.240
 and it really is a beautiful beautiful one 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.880
 cobalt blue color and has such 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.800
 water birds 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.510
 and I just get out because he is 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.540
 not really much nicer never do you see 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.950
 is really super nice shaman then 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.170
 the flaps will be a bit too bad 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.960
 outside and so then I have a jacket here 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.180
 did not necessarily find it very nice one 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.800
 little of that dust material say yes 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.620

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.150
 marie vinck nice for internship and me 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.260
 find those stripes in the lining 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.380
 nice because you have that with the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.030
 sleeves and he also has 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.740
 elbow bed and I like that too 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.930
 detail you here a beautiful 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.240
 dark green blezer really finds a nice one 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:33.370
 color that also of that nice one 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.100
 buttons and he has those here too 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.260
 buttons and so I really have a nice color 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.760
 I come here very nice rust brown 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.400

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.420
 longer model but you can do it 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.060
 taill because you are inside here 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.800
 but from those strings and other wrinkle 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.240
 team at the back and it says so 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.590
 very nice 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.360
 and I really wear this color a lot 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.190
 like it went well this is the same as 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.930
 the green one you just saw but then 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.000
 also color a scene in a kind 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.000
 very dark purple reddish 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.189
 there is a stain here you need the storm 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.919
 pay attention and has again 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.839
 the same button is the green one 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.339
 and I really like to go into this one 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.289
 fall and who has this same 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:18.240
 model like that orange that I just gave you 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.499
 showed that bright color so also one 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.080
 somewhat shorter 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.209
 with those smocked sleeves and this one 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.860
 I think yes quite neat and sick 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:29.659
 and that I also find useful then you can 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.659
 beautiful also about dresses and so wear 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.569
 i just zoom to show it 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.879
 the fault very happy with it and that 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.469
 dark blue that I bed with elbow 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.499
 I also have a black city because of me 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.240
 so liked for internship and such 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.339
 so this one also has those stripes 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.649
 and also that elbow pair and then I have 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.429
 my beautiful leather jacket in hallways because 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:49.080
 Yes 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:51.029
 I also do just show it and 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.319
 this is just like the suede jacket of the 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.169
 Who 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.550
 and from very nice stitching and oblique 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.179
 zipper 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.519
 am really through here on 19 wide 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:04.080
 Sleeves also like those zippers as you 

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:05.789
 sick own never wear it but me 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.169
 I thought let it show 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.180
 this is gray and therefore like the 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.059
 very first bleser who really bought for it 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.729
 10 euros fold in the sale and yes yes 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:16.979
 I think it's a bit too solid 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.569
 by that color and by the model 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.759
 so yes i think i will soon 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.459
 but get away will do 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.559
 and this is the second remained jury bought this 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:27.959
 is a black 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:30.149
 and long model is a bit trine 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.499
 actually very simple 

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:33.209
 but I think it 's a bit tight 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:35.039
 or so I don't know what it was anymore 

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:37.139
 I don't wear them that often anymore either 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.729
 then my sleeveless jackets from that 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.669
 I also really like it 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.740
 this one is from the new yorker this is so fake 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:46.709
 fur waistcoat you say if I also whole 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.479
 very nice about a leather jacket or stand 

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:50.540
 about their tasty white sweaters 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.570
 so and 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.460
 and this is a kind of military style 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.570
 jacket say 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.450
 and you may have one 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.160
 seen in my shoplog a while back 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:05.360
 and then i also really love it anyway 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.910
 I like that army style and so do I 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.550
 you will find a nail jacket indispensable 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.870
 this one has vanilla ravel details 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.900
 I've had it for a while and I like it 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.780
 really nice in summer and spring 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.410
 so its yes well I'm closing for it 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.810
 the video 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.820
 because I really want to thank you 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.730
 because I have the 400 followers this weekend 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.200
 got rid of the no's and there I really am 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.910
 very happy with it 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.460

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.830

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.530
 have reached the 500 followers until I get one 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.360
