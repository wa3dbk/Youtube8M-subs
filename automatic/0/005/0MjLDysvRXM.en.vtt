00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
comes with a tester and what we do is we

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
comes with a tester and what we do is we
take<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.229> alligator<00:01:22.619> clip<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> we'll<00:01:23.280> clip

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
take this alligator clip and we'll clip

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.990 
take this alligator clip and we'll clip
that<00:01:23.729> directly<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> ground<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.000> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that directly to the ground like so and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
that directly to the ground like so and
then<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.600> take<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> pointed<00:01:28.350> end<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
then we could take the pointed end and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
then we could take the pointed end and
probe<00:01:29.460> each<00:01:29.640> individual<00:01:30.150> wire<00:01:30.329> until<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.229> find

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
probe each individual wire until we find

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
probe each individual wire until we find
the<00:01:31.560> wire<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> we're<00:01:32.460> looking<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.880> I'm

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the wire that we're looking for I'm

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.999
