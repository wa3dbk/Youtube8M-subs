00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello it's welcome in recipes 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.120
 roulettes the recipe of the day and the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.010
 sea mussels for two people 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.690
 you need kilos of mussels 25 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 centilitres of white wine 20 g of butter 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.880
 a big branch of celery 2 onions 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.560
 and half a bunch of parsley before any 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.910
 I cleaned the mussels well 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 that is to say that I put them in a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.099
 big tub of cold water and I brewed 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.250
 brew and brew and brewed to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.359
 that she loses well during this one ever 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.619
 has one that stays open it's not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.940
 normal it is cleaner to the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.739
 consumption since when we put shock 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.200
 normally they close section 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.300
 alive this operation will allow you to 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.290
 remove any residual sand if one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.489
 really a lot and bah you 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 repeat a second time in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.340
 first removing the mussels so the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.750
 sand falls to the bottom alive in the water in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 delivering water and in fact in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 the operation because if you remove 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.809
 the water as it goes the sand it will stay 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.430
 go I 'll take care of the fate of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.739
 the onion and celery I'm going to chop 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 finely before getting them back into 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010
 the bar 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.980
 I cook on medium heat for 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.040
 about 5 minutes the idea is really 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.520
 that onion and celery are well 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.830
 tender 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.830
 go we add the white wine the balls 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.720
 and above all we cover but above all life 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.850
 do not hesitate to put from time to time 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 like that and idc they're cooked 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.110
 when they are open 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.290
 we still have a few moments 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.790
 to cut parsley 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.920
 whatever you can do it with 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.659
