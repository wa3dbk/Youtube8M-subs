00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
the same way on all three printers three

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.040 
the same way on all three printers three
different<00:00:31.000> techniques<00:00:31.210> we're<00:00:31.599> going<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.779> use

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
different techniques we're going to use

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.139 
different techniques we're going to use
and<00:00:32.290> that's<00:00:32.980> going<00:00:33.130> to<00:00:33.220> be<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.970> first

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
and that's going to be the first

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.000 
and that's going to be the first
technique<00:00:34.600> would<00:00:34.780> be<00:00:34.840> through<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.320> menu<00:00:35.680> the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
technique would be through the menu the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.740 
technique would be through the menu the
second<00:00:36.340> way<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.640> use<00:00:36.790> a<00:00:36.969> lint-free<00:00:37.270> cloth

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
second way is to use a lint-free cloth

pertain to a climate change so we're
gonna<00:01:00.070> talk<00:01:00.309> about<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.640> three<00:01:00.820> techniques

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
gonna talk about the three techniques

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.070 
gonna talk about the three techniques
right<00:01:01.449> now<00:01:02.819> okay<00:01:03.819> once<00:01:04.059> we<00:01:04.269> have<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.750> printer

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
right now okay once we have the printer

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.960 
right now okay once we have the printer
in<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.320> safe<00:01:05.560> environment<00:01:05.680> meaning<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.730> we're
