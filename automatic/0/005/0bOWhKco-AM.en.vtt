simple tasks together in the right order

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.949 
simple tasks together in the right order
and<00:01:42.069> you<00:01:42.280> get<00:01:42.429> something<00:01:42.880> close<00:01:43.179> to<00:01:43.240> coherent

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
and you get something close to coherent

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.109 
and you get something close to coherent
gameplay<00:01:44.409> well<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.189> concept<00:01:45.579> is<00:01:45.700> novel

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
gameplay well the concept is novel

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.639 
gameplay well the concept is novel
though<00:01:46.299> these<00:01:46.509> aren't<00:01:46.750> really<00:01:47.079> games<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.560> way

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
you are I know them

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.330 
you are I know them
novelties<00:01:49.840> yes<00:01:50.409> but<00:01:50.829> I<00:01:50.860> don't<00:01:50.979> know<00:01:51.189> how

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
novelties yes but I don't know how

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.160 
novelties yes but I don't know how
accurate<00:01:51.819> a<00:01:51.880> high<00:01:52.030> score<00:01:52.479> can<00:01:52.720> be<00:01:52.750> when<00:01:53.079> the

and<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.750> suppose<00:01:56.049> that's<00:01:56.259> natural<00:01:56.470> as<00:01:56.950> you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
and I suppose that's natural as you

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.130 
and I suppose that's natural as you
can't<00:01:57.310> really<00:01:57.579> build<00:01:57.819> force-feedback<00:01:58.630> into<00:01:59.079> a

feels<00:02:01.149> more<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:01.840> flailing<00:02:02.439> than<00:02:02.860> gaming

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
feels more like flailing than gaming

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.999 
feels more like flailing than gaming
whether<00:02:03.729> because<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.750> lack<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.319> collision
