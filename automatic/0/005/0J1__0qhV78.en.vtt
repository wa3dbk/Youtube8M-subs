00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
step up and that's what my plan does so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.230 
step up and that's what my plan does so
just<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.140> be<00:04:58.260> clear<00:04:58.370> I'm<00:04:59.370> not<00:04:59.430> gonna<00:04:59.670> sign<00:04:59.970> any

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
just to be clear I'm not gonna sign any

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.340 
just to be clear I'm not gonna sign any
package<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:01.700> somehow<00:05:02.700> prevents<00:05:03.420> the<00:05:04.110> top

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
package that somehow prevents the top

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.490 
package that somehow prevents the top
rate<00:05:05.310> from<00:05:05.340> going<00:05:05.850> up<00:05:05.970> for<00:05:06.240> folks<00:05:06.510> at<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.290> top

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
rate from going up for folks at the top

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.050 
rate from going up for folks at the top
2%<00:05:08.180> but<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.210> do<00:05:09.390> remain<00:05:10.320> optimistic<00:05:10.830> that<00:05:11.580> we

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
2% but I do remain optimistic that we

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.700 
2% but I do remain optimistic that we
can<00:05:12.090> get<00:05:12.420> something<00:05:12.660> done<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.260> good<00:05:13.440> for

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
can get something done that is good for

families like this ones and that is good

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.960 
families like this ones and that is good
