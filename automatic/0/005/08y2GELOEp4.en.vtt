00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and welcome to the app 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.910
 junkie today i want to give you the gaming 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.660
 performance of macbook air 2013 13 inches 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.410
 with intel age the 5000 graphics card 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 show with the help of minecraft and about that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 I still have a shaders mod 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.769
 really installed the last one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.410
 from the graphics card of the new macbook 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 to bring out and the whole I do 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.220
 for you the purchase decision 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 a bit easier if you so 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.160
 to find out if the macbook air 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 Also suitable for your gaming purposes 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 then stay tuned and if you are 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 then have decided for the product 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.920
 you can find the amazon link in the video 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 description I take the whole again 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.840
 with my iphone 5 on for if i did 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.789
 another program would run around 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.539
 then take the video 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.280
 that the performance of minecraft resp 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.170
 the performance of macbook air is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.620
 pretty restrictive and that's why 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.750
 we do the whole thing via mobile phone 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.250
 and as you can see i have here in the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.189
 shader spot the version 10 installed 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.700
 and let's see what it looks like 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.700
 in game 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.600
 So these are the light reflections 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.600
 water I tried a bit more 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 sharper at the camera and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 my impression is the whole is pretty 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.930
 The sun tries again here fluently 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 to catch a bit now is the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 sun right now that they are so through the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.710
 trees then breaks through the sun 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.990
 Let 's take a look from above 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.319
 I'm not a minecraft player because of that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.489
 the whole thing will not be a gameplay now 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.660
 but I'll give you a little more 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.660
 the performance show the game 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.670
 Let's go up the mountain here 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:50.440
 it is where the sun is doing now 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.530
 maybe I can hide too 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.530
 a different shaders version 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530
 turn on 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.000
 that's ultra I think right now 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.849
 maybe there again the water reflexes 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:17.739
 If I am here again a kind 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:20.079
 by the way , beach is the macbook 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.239
 air is not quite as loud as it is 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.680
 the fan is already working 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.600
 but the microphone is very nice too 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.739
 the volume is sensitive 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.739
 actually quite good to endure 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.470
 maybe the sunset if we 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.470
 to be lucky 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.560
 So, as you can see I have none here 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.560
 great jerk 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.850
 it is noticeably slower than when 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:12.030
 I turn off the shader if we too 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:14.670
 let's see then that's from 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.240
 the framerate he still a lot 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.240
 is faster 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.300
 and now again for comparison 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.990
 So it's fast but you notice 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:01.070
 the movement is not quite as fluid 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.070
 as if without signs 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.699
 and again with ultra 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:37.710
 really slowest with ultras 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.660
 I think if you minecraft without shader 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.720
 then you can play the macbook 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.020
 buy air without restriction if you can 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.150
 play with a mediocre shader 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.820
 I would like to play quality, too 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.110
 still say is absolutely sufficient none 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.500
 noticeable printer at ultra yes there will 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.390
 already a bit jerky so on 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.070
 then possibly the fun of playing 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.780
 be a bit clouded 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.060
 could if you look for the macbook 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.790
 Decides then you will find in the video 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.370
 description an amazon link and there 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:16.100
 can you then the macbook air for 1000 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.100
 euro and a few crushed purchase
