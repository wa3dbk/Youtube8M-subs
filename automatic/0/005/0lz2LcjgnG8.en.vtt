00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 how are you good night good night 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.609
 shot well in good interview is the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.230
 ortiz cat and our companions 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.389
 multimedia today in monterrey and santiago 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.590
 forcada and the order eyes to entered the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.570
 criminal that is on the outskirts of each 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.120
 right and good because they could make it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 this interview to the cat that already has the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 ortiz cat that already has a little more than 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.380
 a year prisoner talks about very 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.670
 interesting but what he called more the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 attention of the media that documented 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.990
 today practically everywhere was the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.240
 issue that says that he spent many 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 anti-doping tests at least four says 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.170
 without being detected until it fell 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.210
 but when I was in Colombia in a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 party of the liberators cup if you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 it seems we are going to listen a little bit what 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340
 that we have later in the version 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.150
 extended interview 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 I do 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:49.220
 if I did something to affect me 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.690
 they touched me like around 45 doping 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.390
 here in Mexico and nothing came out 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.390
 then I trust you trust me what 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
 I kept taking the time to go play 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 colombia the liberators cup I have the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.490
 doping and that's where where really 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.900
 if they do the test where it comes out positive 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 by taking oxymetholone 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.100
 to what he said it was to generate 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 muscle he did not think it to improve in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.900
 the performance but because he was stuck 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 I really need the gym to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.080
 obviously having that musculature that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 You must follow still behind by 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 course if they did quickly we're going to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 see this where he talks about his 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.860
 innocence about what he defends as 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.860
 His innocence 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.720
 you tell me why I consider myself 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.670
 innocent 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 and I did it very confident because what are 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:48.290
 the arguments that you have to say 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.580
 good arguments and evidence that to the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.580
 people who 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 with which they are not involving you are 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.820
 harmed was to people that I lived with 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.790
 them a long time that the only thing that I 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.220
 I can tell you is 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.670
 is to thank him for everything they did for 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.100
 me then the people who were always at 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.720
 pending of me and my family and that in 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.950
 no time I would be able to 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.950
 to have done them some damage
