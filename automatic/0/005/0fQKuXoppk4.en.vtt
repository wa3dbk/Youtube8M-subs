00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590 
here so now we're ready to assemble the
salad<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.640> if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> wooden<00:02:18.420> bowl

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
salad so if you have a wooden bowl

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.790 
salad so if you have a wooden bowl
that's<00:02:18.810> traditionally<00:02:19.320> how<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.500> Caesar

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that's traditionally how the Caesar

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.270 
that's traditionally how the Caesar
salad<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.630> served<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.560> we're<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> take

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
salad is served and we're going to take

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.990 
salad is served and we're going to take
our<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:24.780> garlic<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.460> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.640> rub<00:02:26.910> it

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
our have garlic and just kind of rub it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.910 
our have garlic and just kind of rub it
along<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.270> side<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.750> it'll<00:02:27.930> work<00:02:28.200> well<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.830> our

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
along the side so it'll work well in our

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.090 
along the side so it'll work well in our
metal<00:02:29.190> bowl<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
metal bowl but if you have you know a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.560 
metal bowl but if you have you know a
wooden<00:02:32.520> bullet<00:02:32.820> will<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.120> kind<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.360> like

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
wooden bullet will just kind of like

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.090 
wooden bullet will just kind of like
soaked<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.080> fold<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.500> there<00:02:34.620> even<00:02:34.770> better

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
soaked and fold in there even better

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.040 
soaked and fold in there even better
obviously<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.700> metal<00:02:35.970> won't<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.330> hold<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
obviously the metal won't like hold a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
obviously the metal won't like hold a
flavor<00:02:37.320> as<00:02:37.650> well<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.959> wooden<00:02:40.320> bowl<00:02:40.800> would

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
flavor as well as the wooden bowl would

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.560 
flavor as well as the wooden bowl would
so<00:02:41.820> we're<00:02:41.910> not<00:02:42.000> going<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.209> leave<00:02:42.330> these<00:02:42.510> in

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
so we're not going to leave these in

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.880 
so we're not going to leave these in
here<00:02:42.810> which<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.050> rubbing<00:02:43.380> them<00:02:43.500> along<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
here which is rubbing them along the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.460 
here which is rubbing them along the
side<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.540> giving<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.570> nice<00:02:45.750> little<00:02:45.989> essence
