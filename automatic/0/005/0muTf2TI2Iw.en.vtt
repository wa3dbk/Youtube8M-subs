00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello here is everything from epo.de and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.880
 Today, take a look at the new 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.679
 Torino appears to be acting 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.309
 this is a community project 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.340
 from thalia world picture hugendubel the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.720
 German telecom bertelsmann 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.310
 It is basically the first German e 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 book reader of it technically with the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.199
 can compete with the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 competition coburg in detroit 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.289
 He has a 6 inch display with 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.350
 it can represent 16 gray scales as you like 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.730
 also knows it from the other devices 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 Also included is one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
 lighting so that you can stay in the dark 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.850
 can read or worse 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.039
 light conditions 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 The internal memory is 4 gigabytes 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.440
 but only 2 gb for the user 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 to be available 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.930
 the processing of the berliner sparkle is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.629
 really good so the first one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.610
 impression is excellent 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.530
 the device does not crack is not that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.700
 nothing wobbles so there is really 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.680
 nothing to complain about 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 the edges and gap dimensions are all 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 evenly so is on very 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.400
 high level 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.869
 the input is via the infrared 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.189
 Touchscreen the one from the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.680
 it is therefore hardly provocative 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.060
 reflections on the screen so that is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.619
 also on a very low level 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.630
 level is not better at the moment 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.710
 We activate the device by using the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.320
 many controls on the left side above 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 press and land very fast 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.009
 at the start screen as you can see 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.320
 this is very simple so that 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.310
 No problems around here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.780
 find your way 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.659
 up here you can see the last three 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 read books down here you can see 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.600
 the partner shop in the case of 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.729
 You can talk about the world 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.250
 get into the library here 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.869
 There are different views here 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.810
 the cover view and the next ones 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.110
 view can always count that too 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.090
 everything works very fast you can 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.980
 furthermore the e-books sort by 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.380
 Actual title author last read 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.150
 you can delete e-books you can 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.790
 update the library and you can 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.740
 Also check the device for e-books 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.810
 here also appears at the bottom 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.000
 screen automatically the keyboard 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.000
 which thanks android substructure really 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.040
 very fast and works very well 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.690
 so you see there are no problems here 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.300
 it remains to be hoped that one more 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.820
 memo function will be submitted then 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.190
 also with the keyboard the inputs 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.570
 can do 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.370
 he switches back to homescreen and 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.570
 open a book as you can see 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.640
 works but that very quickly 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.130
 you can scroll with one 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.700
 simple antique to the right or 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:13.140
 left side of the screen or with 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.459
 a wipe on the display so synonymous 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.090
 You already know that from others 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.780
 devices 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.040
 but that works very reliable 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.690
 with a tap in the middle in the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.370
 middle part of the display you can do that 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.959
 call optionsmodell here you can see 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.590
 down the side the page can be fast 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:37.739
 change with a simple change and 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.450
 Here you can see the font size 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.070
 you can remember how you can see 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.040
 now safely borrowed 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.790
 the kindle pepper white the one 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.640
 similar a similar settings menu 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.290
 It offers a total of five font 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.799
 you had to choose or 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.970
 just the publisher standard and 7 speaks 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.489
 sizes there are unfortunately no 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.620
 Settings for line and wall distance 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.260
 or here we hope that still 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.299
 will be handed down as you can see above 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.769
 can see you can put these signs 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.480
 This symbol is really on everyone 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.430
 only when you press it will it 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.730
 filled in and bookmark set 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.770
 It is a pity that you are here 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.959
 So this symbol always has in view 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.239
 that too should come with one 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.590
 Software update not repaired 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.699
 so that's not always in the right 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.130
 The upper corner can be seen otherwise 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.099
 It remains to say that you are up here 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.810
 the brightness can be activated 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.810
 this is most likely to be seen now 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.770
 not in good outdoor lighting 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.289
 really I already have it in 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.630
 darkness tried and the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.960
 Lighting is equally something 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.250
 bluish as the coupe and in the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.800
 but still no childcare 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.650
 problem so you see the brownish 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.530
 china only in direct comparison the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.880
 read darkness well then that im 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.280
 I finally have to work 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.720
 However, the report still shows, however 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.009
 according to experience, really with the others 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.770
 There should be no problems here 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.860
 give 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.990
 As far as the display quality is concerned, there are 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.069
 yes, nothing to complain about the contrast 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.380
 is really good 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.690
 the measurements were also done in 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.330
 Review 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.199
 and also with activated lighting 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.550
 the contrast remains 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.530
 Contrast ratio very good so 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.550
 not somehow labeled washed out 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:35.370
 or something that unfortunately not 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.300
 can do is next to these and 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.699
 dictionaries, 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.070
 So you see when you for years to 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.449
 it just does not happen what you hear 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.500
 also can not do that is 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.699
 attitude to the page change one can 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.360
 no complete change of time 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.240
 force 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.800
 the success must every fifth page when 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:58.710
 I saw that correctly 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.599
 problem with it as always just that gets 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.000
 it gives a slight ghosting effect 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.830
 which can be quite disturbing for some 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.330
 So here should definitely be 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.990
 be improved so that the 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.909
 You can also make adjustments yourself 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:16.229
 otherwise there is one more 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:18.030
 integrated internet browser calls the 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.449
 man on the settings menu on that 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.500
 you can see here 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.319
 also the internet browser used 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.940
 of course, android as a substructure for that 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.139
 all other operating system, a 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.210
 works very well 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.210
 we wait for the wlan 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:42.180
 is connected and then land already on 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:45.770
 we still look at the google homepage 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.770
 we can call our page 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.610
 and that works fine as well 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.610
 you can see so here 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:13.789
 scrolling tenderly down works 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.789
 gradually as you can see 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.830
 yes that was it already with the 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.690
 quick and short insight into the 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.000
 Function of the turbine 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:30.140
 We'll get back to you shortly 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.540
 one includes their video and one 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.620
 test report then he on our 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.160
 homepage and until then until 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.160
 next time
