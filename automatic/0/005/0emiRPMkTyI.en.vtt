00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
called a delta update which means it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
called a delta update which means it
only<00:00:43.710> downloads<00:00:44.340> half<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.969> files<00:00:45.180> they

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
needs so updates usually around on

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060 
needs so updates usually around on
iTunes<00:01:24.990> usually<00:01:25.350> around<00:01:25.530> eight<00:01:25.770> hundred

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
iTunes usually around eight hundred

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469 
iTunes usually around eight hundred
twenty<00:01:26.280> four<00:01:26.460> megabytes<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.390> see

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
twenty four megabytes now as you can see

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.890 
twenty four megabytes now as you can see
from<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> picture<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.770> only<00:01:28.890> 103

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
from that picture there there only 103

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.510 
from that picture there there only 103
133<00:01:30.900> megabytes<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> could<00:01:31.829> change<00:01:31.890> when

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
133 megabytes so this could change when

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.190 
133 megabytes so this could change when
it<00:01:32.640> actually<00:01:32.790> comes<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.780> doubt<00:01:34.020> I'll

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it actually comes out but I doubt I'll

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
it actually comes out but I doubt I'll
be<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.500> bigger<00:01:34.740> than<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.030> saving

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
be much bigger than that so it's saving

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
be much bigger than that so it's saving
you<00:01:36.509> almost<00:01:36.780> 700<00:01:37.530> megabytes<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you almost 700 megabytes with a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
you almost 700 megabytes with a
downloading<00:01:38.990> another<00:01:39.990> thing<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> note<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
downloading another thing to note is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.469 
downloading another thing to note is
