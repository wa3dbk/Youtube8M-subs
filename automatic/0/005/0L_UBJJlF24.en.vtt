completely went off target and yeah
that's<00:03:24.480> pretty<00:03:24.540> much<00:03:24.720> how<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> game<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> we

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
that's pretty much how the game in it we

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.860 
that's pretty much how the game in it we
draw<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> game<00:03:26.459> 2-2<00:03:26.910> because<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.359> didn't<00:03:27.750> go

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
draw the game 2-2 because we didn't go

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.110 
draw the game 2-2 because we didn't go
into<00:03:28.049> extra<00:03:28.470> times<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.069> after<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.639> we<00:03:29.849> move

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
into extra times so after that we move

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.089 
into extra times so after that we move
on<00:03:30.299> into<00:03:30.720> another<00:03:31.139> game<00:03:31.319> but<00:03:31.500> before<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.949> we

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
on into another game but before that we

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.740 
on into another game but before that we
apply<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> healing<00:03:32.760> contact<00:03:33.120> quickly<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.629> also

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
apply a healing contact quickly and also

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.839 
apply a healing contact quickly and also
a<00:03:33.870> contact<00:03:34.319> card<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> woloson<00:03:35.370> because<00:03:35.609> he<00:03:35.699> was

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
a contact card to woloson because he was

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.819 
a contact card to woloson because he was
running<00:03:36.239> out<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.389> them<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:36.840> after<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.199> we<00:03:37.680> go

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
running out of them and after that we go

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.470 
running out of them and after that we go
to<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.129> third<00:03:38.370> game<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.879> episode<00:03:39.239> where
