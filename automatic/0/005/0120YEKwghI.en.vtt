00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.729 

guys<00:02:25.459> if<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.540> guys<00:02:26.689> fill<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.319> easy

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
guys if you guys fill it the easy

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.229 
guys if you guys fill it the easy
running<00:02:28.099> slow<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.430> internet<00:02:28.790> browser<00:02:29.000> it's

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
running slow on internet browser it's

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.430 
running slow on internet browser it's
because<00:02:29.540> people<00:02:29.810> are<00:02:29.870> not<00:02:29.989> closing<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
because people are not closing the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.140 
because people are not closing the
applications<00:02:31.010> correctly<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.000> like<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
applications correctly so it's like a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.460 
applications correctly so it's like a
computer<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.930> analyze<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
computer when you analyze the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.660 
computer when you analyze the
applications<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.099> that's<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.489> slow

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
applications like that's going to slow

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.659 
applications like that's going to slow
it<00:02:34.819> down<00:02:34.849> that's<00:02:35.209> why<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> may<00:02:35.599> be
