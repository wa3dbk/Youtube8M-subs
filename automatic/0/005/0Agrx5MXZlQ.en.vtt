set up very well at all but dark sectors

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.130 
set up very well at all but dark sectors
is<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.640> closest<00:02:42.030> thing<00:02:42.180> we've<00:02:42.329> had<00:02:42.540> actual

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
is the closest thing we've had actual

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.360 
is the closest thing we've had actual
enjoyable<00:02:44.129> pvp<00:02:44.579> in<00:02:44.790> warframe<00:02:45.629> so<00:02:46.079> it's<00:02:46.620> closer

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
enjoyable pvp in warframe so it's closer

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.740 
enjoyable pvp in warframe so it's closer
still<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.760> lot<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.879> problems<00:02:48.209> with<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.480> but

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
still a lot of problems with it but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.690 
still a lot of problems with it but
there's<00:02:49.290> hope<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.129> they<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.489> work

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
there's hope and I think they will work

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
there's hope and I think they will work
it<00:02:50.879> out<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.239> PvP<00:02:51.780> might<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.170> big<00:02:52.409> thing<00:02:52.440> so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it out and PvP might be a big thing so

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.699 
it out and PvP might be a big thing so
