00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
yeah this is something that a screen

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.640 
yeah this is something that a screen
printer<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.660> gonna<00:00:09.809> come<00:00:10.019> across<00:00:10.349> like<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
printer is gonna come across like a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.509 
printer is gonna come across like a
billion<00:00:11.309> times<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:12.420> year<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.349> yeah<00:00:14.190> might<00:00:14.490> as

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
billion times a year so yeah might as

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.700 
billion times a year so yeah might as
well<00:00:14.580> learn<00:00:14.880> how<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.410> see

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
well learn how to do it so as we can see

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
well learn how to do it so as we can see
as<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.130> zoom<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:18.109> somebody<00:00:19.109> tried<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.410> clean

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
as we zoom in somebody tried to clean

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400 
as we zoom in somebody tried to clean
this<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.060> looking<00:00:21.510> pretty<00:00:21.810> lumpy<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this up but it's looking pretty lumpy to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.070 
this up but it's looking pretty lumpy to
me<00:00:22.850> yeah<00:00:23.880> depending<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.449> how<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.660> resolve

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
me yeah depending on how you resolve

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.259 
me yeah depending on how you resolve
your<00:00:25.170> screens<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.890> know<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.310> might<00:00:26.699> not<00:00:26.730> come

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
your screens you know it might not come

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.410 
your screens you know it might not come
out<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.689> obvious<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:30.000> easy<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
out that obvious but it's really easy to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
out that obvious but it's really easy to
fix<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.199> might<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.470> well<00:00:31.560> go<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:32.009> doing

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
fix so we might as well go about doing

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.170 
fix so we might as well go about doing
that<00:00:32.780> first<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> address<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
that first thing I want to address is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
that first thing I want to address is
I'm<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.360> use<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.829> blur<00:00:37.829> technique<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> I've

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I'm gonna use a blur technique and I've

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.220 
I'm gonna use a blur technique and I've
got<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> problem<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.750> where<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:39.989> looks<00:00:40.050> like

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
got a problem here where it looks like

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
got a problem here where it looks like
somebody<00:00:40.920> accidentally<00:00:41.430> cropped<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> off<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
somebody accidentally cropped this off a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.880 
somebody accidentally cropped this off a
little<00:00:42.480> too<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.379> might<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.680> just

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
little too much so we might as well just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.959 
little too much so we might as well just
fix<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> canvas<00:00:44.730> size<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:46.430> all<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
fix the canvas size first all right so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.549 
fix the canvas size first all right so
I'm<00:00:48.090> anchoring<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.629> canvas<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> left

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I'm anchoring the canvas to the left

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.299 
I'm anchoring the canvas to the left
extend<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.879> white<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.050> width<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.500> 14

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
extend it out with white the width is 14

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
extend it out with white the width is 14
something<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.360> let's<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.840> make<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
something right now let's just make this

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.189 
something right now let's just make this
like<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:56.190> 15<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> quarter<00:00:58.070> boom<00:01:00.199> there

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
like about 15 and a quarter boom there

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.410 
like about 15 and a quarter boom there
we<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.559> you've<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.760> extra<00:01:03.000> space

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
we go you've got a little extra space

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
we go you've got a little extra space
there<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:05.549> might<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.939> well<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.570> mean<00:01:07.040> there's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
there so I might as well I mean there's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
there so I might as well I mean there's
no<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.549> magically<00:01:08.790> bring<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> back

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
no way to just magically bring that back

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.469 
no way to just magically bring that back
so<00:01:10.439> I'm<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.700> my<00:01:11.880> brush<00:01:12.150> tool

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so I'm just gonna get out my brush tool

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
so I'm just gonna get out my brush tool
and<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> paint<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:14.010> make

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and just kind of paint one in let's make

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.210 
and just kind of paint one in let's make
sure<00:01:14.189> we're<00:01:14.520> 100%<00:01:14.909> hard<00:01:15.890> don't<00:01:16.890> take<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
sure we're 100% hard don't take that the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.109 
sure we're 100% hard don't take that the
wrong<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:18.979> yeah<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
wrong way yeah we're just gonna kind of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.530 
wrong way yeah we're just gonna kind of
just<00:01:21.330> estimate<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.850> something<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
just estimate this to be something like

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.969 
just estimate this to be something like
that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.880 
that
we'll<00:01:26.939> follow<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.810> eraser<00:01:28.380> also

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
we'll follow it up with an eraser also

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.899 
we'll follow it up with an eraser also
very<00:01:29.490> hard<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:31.430> nip<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:32.640> these

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
very hard so that we can nip off these

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.340 
very hard so that we can nip off these
little<00:01:33.030> shark<00:01:33.420> fins<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.079> we've<00:01:34.229> got<00:01:34.530> here

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
little shark fins that we've got here

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.450 
little shark fins that we've got here
all<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.409> cool

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
all right cool

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.810 
all right cool
I<00:01:38.490> mean<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.240> could<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.630> around<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I mean we could go around like this and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.340 
I mean we could go around like this and
really<00:01:42.479> clean<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.579> but<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.790> would<00:01:44.909> take

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
really clean it up but that would take

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.120 
really clean it up but that would take
forever<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.420> we've<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:49.130> it's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
forever so we've got what we need it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.660 
forever so we've got what we need it's
just<00:01:50.659> full<00:01:51.659> zoom<00:01:51.930> out<00:01:52.229> okay<00:01:52.920> everything's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just full zoom out okay everything's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.899 
just full zoom out okay everything's

gonna push a quarter of an inch every
direction<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:08.280> gives<00:02:08.459> me<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:08.789> space

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
direction there just gives me some space

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.550 
direction there just gives me some space
for<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.989> I'm<00:02:10.110> gonna<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.470> next<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.000> yeah<00:02:12.720> my

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
for what I'm gonna do next so yeah my

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.900 
for what I'm gonna do next so yeah my
main<00:02:14.540> cleanup<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> single<00:02:16.980> color<00:02:17.220> solid

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
main cleanup for a single color solid

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.910 
main cleanup for a single color solid
color<00:02:18.180> art<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.020> my<00:02:19.290> main<00:02:19.440> cleanup

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
color art like this my main cleanup

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.990 
color art like this my main cleanup
tools<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.690> Gaussian<00:02:21.690> blur<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:23.000> curves

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
tools are Gaussian blur and then curves

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.500 
tools are Gaussian blur and then curves
so<00:02:24.660> yeah<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.470> seems<00:02:25.830> counterintuitive<00:02:26.819> to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
so yeah it seems counterintuitive to

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.559 
so yeah it seems counterintuitive to
blur<00:02:27.750> first<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.620> by<00:02:29.310> when<00:02:30.180> you're<00:02:30.300> trying<00:02:30.480> to

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
blur first but by when you're trying to

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.740 
blur first but by when you're trying to
sharpen<00:02:30.840> something<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.910> effect<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.480> blur

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
sharpen something but in effect the blur

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.050 
sharpen something but in effect the blur
is<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.230> gonna<00:02:34.410> soften<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.220> edge<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.940> let

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
is just gonna soften this edge and let

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.860 
is just gonna soften this edge and let
me<00:02:36.180> kind<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.480> bring<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.750> back<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:38.269> yeah<00:02:39.269> let's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
me kind of bring it back so yeah let's

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.589 
me kind of bring it back so yeah let's
try<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> little<00:02:40.500> click<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:40.950> filter<00:02:41.540> down<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
try a little click so filter down to

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.699 
try a little click so filter down to
blur<00:02:42.989> Gaussian<00:02:43.920> blur<00:02:45.049> we<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
blur Gaussian blur we can see up to

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.120 
blur Gaussian blur we can see up to
pixels<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.370> getting<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.819> little<00:02:47.850> bit

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
pixels it's getting it a little bit

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.039 
pixels it's getting it a little bit
Vardy<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:51.030> double<00:02:51.299> check<00:02:51.540> yeah<00:02:51.810> we're

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
Vardy just double check yeah we're

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.699 
Vardy just double check yeah we're
already<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.560> good<00:02:53.519> size<00:02:53.819> good<00:02:54.390> resolution<00:02:55.200> so

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
already in good size good resolution so

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.620 
already in good size good resolution so
we<00:02:56.580> definitely<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.420> we

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
we definitely want to be in that we

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.729 
we definitely want to be in that we
don't<00:02:57.780> want<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.989> be<00:02:58.080> doing<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.470> kind<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
don't want to be doing this kind of

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.370 
don't want to be doing this kind of
operation<00:02:59.069> at<00:02:59.340> 72<00:02:59.849> dpi<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.599> get<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
operation at 72 dpi so get it to the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.650 
operation at 72 dpi so get it to the
size<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.590> resolution<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.489> want<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.180> go

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
size and resolution you want and then go

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.360 
size and resolution you want and then go
ahead<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.019> we're<00:03:04.680> gonna<00:03:04.799> filter<00:03:05.390> blur

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
ahead and we're gonna filter blur

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.449 
ahead and we're gonna filter blur
Gaussian<00:03:08.370> blur<00:03:09.200> okay<00:03:10.200> obviously<00:03:10.440> that's<00:03:11.310> not

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
Gaussian blur okay obviously that's not

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.050 
Gaussian blur okay obviously that's not
doing<00:03:12.060> too<00:03:12.239> much<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.810> pixels<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.760> kind

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
doing too much to pixels so I just kind

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.849 
doing too much to pixels so I just kind
of<00:03:15.120> bump<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> out<00:03:16.190> all<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.310> want<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.730> just

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
of bump it out all I want is to just

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.229 
of bump it out all I want is to just
almost<00:03:19.859> have<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.070> way<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.310> kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.730> average

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
almost have a way to kind of average

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.000 
almost have a way to kind of average
this<00:03:21.600> edge<00:03:22.760> like<00:03:24.440> you're<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:25.530> gonna<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.859> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
this edge like you're just gonna have to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.190 
this edge like you're just gonna have to
use<00:03:26.160> your<00:03:26.190> judgement<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.060> mean<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:27.930> not<00:03:28.019> gonna

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
use your judgement I mean it's not gonna

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.750 
use your judgement I mean it's not gonna
be<00:03:28.290> perfect<00:03:28.500> we're<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.130> gonna<00:03:29.250> have<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.549> a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
be perfect we're not gonna have like a

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.610 
be perfect we're not gonna have like a
vector<00:03:30.239> looking<00:03:30.569> edge<00:03:30.750> unless<00:03:31.079> we<00:03:31.230> do<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> live

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
vector looking edge unless we do a live

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.640 
vector looking edge unless we do a live
trace<00:03:31.950> afterwards<00:03:32.609> but<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.420> think<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.410> this

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
trace afterwards but I think that this

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.050 
trace afterwards but I think that this
might<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.190> decent<00:03:35.579> average<00:03:37.790> kind<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.910> want

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
might be a decent average kind of want

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.849 
might be a decent average kind of want
to<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.209> able<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.510> come<00:03:39.989> out<00:03:40.230> squeeee<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.829> a

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
to be able to come out squeeee in a

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.440 
to be able to come out squeeee in a
little<00:03:41.190> bit<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.650> see<00:03:43.650> smoother<00:03:44.100> edges<00:03:44.450> when

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
little bit and see smoother edges when

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.080 
little bit and see smoother edges when
you<00:03:45.540> squint<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.549> obviously<00:03:47.549> we<00:03:47.700> got<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:47.850> little

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
you squint so obviously we got a little

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.610 
you squint so obviously we got a little
kind<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.329> stair<00:03:48.540> step<00:03:48.840> pattern<00:03:48.870> there

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
kind of stair step pattern there

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.430 
kind of stair step pattern there
happening<00:03:50.549> it's<00:03:50.940> kind<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.359> nasty<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:51.870> yeah

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
happening it's kind of nasty but yeah

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.140 
happening it's kind of nasty but yeah
let's<00:03:53.010> hit<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.340> our<00:03:53.459> curves<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.030> see

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
let's hit it with our curves and see

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.720 
let's hit it with our curves and see
what<00:03:54.299> we<00:03:54.359> can<00:03:54.480> do<00:03:54.660> so<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:55.170> curves<00:03:55.500> all<00:03:56.400> we're

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
what we can do so in curves all we're

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.120 
what we can do so in curves all we're
intending<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.690> do<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.139> push<00:03:58.380> our<00:03:58.530> white<00:03:58.769> point

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
intending to do is push our white point

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.580 
intending to do is push our white point
towards<00:03:59.609> our<00:03:59.760> black<00:03:59.970> point<00:04:00.380> until<00:04:01.380> they're

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
towards our black point until they're

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.610 
towards our black point until they're
just<00:04:01.620> about<00:04:02.160> meeting<00:04:02.579> so<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.690> I'll<00:04:04.319> generally

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
just about meeting so and I'll generally

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.650 
just about meeting so and I'll generally
be<00:04:04.799> kind<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.700> 50%<00:04:06.620> area<00:04:07.620> like<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.660> and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
be kind of in the 50% area like that and

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.940 
be kind of in the 50% area like that and
like<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:11.209> yeah<00:04:12.209> if<00:04:12.269> we<00:04:12.480> zoom<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:13.109> we<00:04:13.530> can

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
like that yeah if we zoom in we can

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.860 
like that yeah if we zoom in we can
still<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.940> there<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.269> bit<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.660> wave

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
still see that there is a bit of a wave

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.870 
still see that there is a bit of a wave
if<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.200> was<00:04:16.289> probably<00:04:16.590> worst<00:04:16.889> in<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.250> area

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.120 

but

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.270 

it<00:04:24.130> has<00:04:24.430> minimized<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.630> yeah<00:04:26.500> there's<00:04:26.860> still<00:04:27.100> a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
it has minimized it yeah there's still a

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.550 
it has minimized it yeah there's still a
bit<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.760> wave<00:04:27.970> there<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.900> has<00:04:29.050> minimized

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
bit of a wave there but it has minimized

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.490 
bit of a wave there but it has minimized
it<00:04:31.290> go<00:04:32.290> ahead<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.470> bring<00:04:32.740> up<00:04:32.890> our<00:04:33.040> history

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
it go ahead and bring up our history

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.950 
it go ahead and bring up our history
rewind<00:04:35.500> when<00:04:35.830> we<00:04:35.950> first<00:04:36.190> opened<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:39.960> where

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
rewind when we first opened it so where

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.880 
rewind when we first opened it so where
we<00:04:41.140> are<00:04:41.320> now<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:43.780> slight<00:04:44.110> but<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.590> thing<00:04:44.770> is

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
we are now it's slight but the thing is

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.280 
we are now it's slight but the thing is
we<00:04:45.100> can<00:04:45.220> do<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.430> again<00:04:45.640> let's<00:04:46.630> try<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.050> one<00:04:47.230> more

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
we can do it again let's try it one more

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.030 
we can do it again let's try it one more
time<00:04:47.680> blur<00:04:48.580> Gaussian<00:04:49.510> blur<00:04:52.710> let's<00:04:53.710> try<00:04:53.980> it

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
time blur Gaussian blur let's try it

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.210 
time blur Gaussian blur let's try it
even<00:04:54.130> harder<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.760> time

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
even harder this time

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.710 
even harder this time
okay<00:04:57.220> back<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:57.970> our<00:04:58.210> curves<00:04:58.630> once<00:04:59.380> again<00:05:00.720> and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
okay back to our curves once again and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.570 
okay back to our curves once again and
have<00:05:01.870> them<00:05:02.020> meet<00:05:02.200> halfway<00:05:06.690> look<00:05:07.690> at<00:05:07.840> that

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
have them meet halfway look at that

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.310 
have them meet halfway look at that
alright

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
alright

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.350 
alright
most<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.530> lumpiness<00:05:11.860> is<00:05:12.460> gone<00:05:12.730> I<00:05:12.970> mean<00:05:13.150> there's

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
most of lumpiness is gone I mean there's

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.920 
most of lumpiness is gone I mean there's
still<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.690> couple<00:05:13.990> lumps<00:05:14.530> but<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:16.660> integrity

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
still a couple lumps but the integrity

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.440 
still a couple lumps but the integrity
of<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.290> designs<00:05:17.650> still<00:05:18.160> pretty<00:05:18.910> much<00:05:19.090> there

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
of the designs still pretty much there

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.010 
of the designs still pretty much there
as<00:05:19.600> far<00:05:19.810> as<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.050> can<00:05:20.110> tell<00:05:21.540> who<00:05:22.540> knows<00:05:22.720> we<00:05:22.900> can

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
as far as I can tell who knows we can

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.690 
as far as I can tell who knows we can
try<00:05:23.200> it<00:05:23.260> one<00:05:23.440> more<00:05:23.560> time<00:05:23.680> just<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.280> try<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.550> get

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
try it one more time just to try to get

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.720 
try it one more time just to try to get
rid<00:05:24.730> of<00:05:24.970> that<00:05:25.450> chunk<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.620> chunk<00:05:27.040> got<00:05:27.550> some

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
rid of that chunk that chunk got some

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.690 
rid of that chunk that chunk got some
lumps<00:05:28.090> down<00:05:28.330> here<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.870> mean<00:05:29.169> obviously<00:05:29.890> the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
lumps down here I mean obviously the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.909 
lumps down here I mean obviously the
client<00:05:31.270> shouldn't<00:05:31.870> have<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.169> expectation<00:05:32.860> of

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
client shouldn't have the expectation of

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.880 
client shouldn't have the expectation of
exactly<00:05:33.400> perfect<00:05:33.910> art<00:05:34.120> when<00:05:34.450> they<00:05:34.890> submitted

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
exactly perfect art when they submitted

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.610 
exactly perfect art when they submitted
something<00:05:36.220> as<00:05:36.460> lumpy<00:05:36.760> as<00:05:36.880> they<00:05:37.030> did<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:37.630> but

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
something as lumpy as they did so but

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.400 
something as lumpy as they did so but
yeah<00:05:38.800> we<00:05:39.160> can<00:05:39.190> just<00:05:39.550> show<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:39.970> one<00:05:40.810> more<00:05:41.110> pass

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
yeah we can just show that one more pass

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.100 
yeah we can just show that one more pass
I<00:05:42.960> even<00:05:43.960> do<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.290> one<00:05:45.130> more<00:05:45.400> bit<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:45.640> good

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.760 

obviously<00:05:50.110> we're<00:05:50.229> taking<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.530> lot<00:05:50.710> of

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
obviously we're taking a lot of

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.040 
obviously we're taking a lot of
liberties<00:05:51.280> with<00:05:51.550> clients<00:05:52.210> applied<00:05:52.479> art<00:05:52.750> but

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
liberties with clients applied art but

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.219 
liberties with clients applied art but
it's<00:05:53.229> ultimately<00:05:53.860> in<00:05:54.400> their<00:05:54.550> best<00:05:54.760> interest

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.570 

all<00:05:59.229> right

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
all right

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.600 
all right
so<00:06:01.540> that<00:06:01.720> looks<00:06:01.900> like<00:06:02.200> pretty<00:06:02.920> damn<00:06:03.190> smooth

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
so that looks like pretty damn smooth

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:11.040 
so that looks like pretty damn smooth
text<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.240> me<00:06:06.570> I'm<00:06:07.570> just<00:06:07.810> gonna<00:06:09.510> take<00:06:10.510> a<00:06:10.540> look<00:06:10.870> at

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
text to me I'm just gonna take a look at

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.880 
text to me I'm just gonna take a look at
it<00:06:11.290> all<00:06:11.650> right<00:06:11.890> why<00:06:12.280> don't<00:06:12.310> we<00:06:13.440> 8b<00:06:14.440> it<00:06:14.560> with<00:06:14.740> our

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
it all right why don't we 8b it with our

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:24.120 
it all right why don't we 8b it with our
original<00:06:19.530> that's<00:06:20.530> pretty<00:06:21.400> grimy<00:06:23.130> by

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
original that's pretty grimy by

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.080 
original that's pretty grimy by
comparison<00:06:26.310> where<00:06:27.310> we<00:06:27.490> are<00:06:27.640> now

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
comparison where we are now

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.380 
comparison where we are now
all<00:06:28.540> right<00:06:29.700> let's<00:06:30.700> say<00:06:30.880> that's<00:06:31.120> a<00:06:31.240> pretty

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
all right let's say that's a pretty

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.160 
all right let's say that's a pretty
clean<00:06:31.750> clean<00:06:32.140> up<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:33.520> if<00:06:33.790> I<00:06:33.910> want<00:06:34.120> to<00:06:34.270> crop<00:06:34.990> it

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
clean clean up and if I want to crop it

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.980 
clean clean up and if I want to crop it
down<00:06:35.350> to<00:06:35.560> exact<00:06:36.180> dimensions<00:06:37.180> all<00:06:37.360> I<00:06:37.420> can<00:06:37.570> go<00:06:37.720> do

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
down to exact dimensions all I can go do

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.930 
down to exact dimensions all I can go do
is<00:06:38.140> just<00:06:38.320> go<00:06:38.470> over<00:06:38.560> to<00:06:38.680> my<00:06:38.830> channels<00:06:39.730> palette

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
is just go over to my channels palette

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.060 
is just go over to my channels palette
command<00:06:40.540> click<00:06:40.780> on<00:06:40.930> that<00:06:41.170> I've<00:06:41.680> now<00:06:42.010> selected

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
command click on that I've now selected

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.620 
command click on that I've now selected
all<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.640> white<00:06:42.790> space<00:06:42.970> so<00:06:43.450> let's<00:06:43.630> do<00:06:43.840> a<00:06:44.490> select

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
all the white space so let's do a select

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:52.140 
all the white space so let's do a select
inverse<00:06:47.130> image<00:06:48.600> crop<00:06:49.680> though<00:06:50.680> got<00:06:51.520> perfect

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
inverse image crop though got perfect

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.750 
inverse image crop though got perfect
dimension<00:06:52.630> crop<00:06:53.200> to<00:06:53.470> exactly<00:06:54.220> to<00:06:54.400> the<00:06:54.490> artwork

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
dimension crop to exactly to the artwork

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.410 
dimension crop to exactly to the artwork
I<00:06:55.620> believe<00:06:56.620> this<00:06:56.740> is<00:06:56.920> probably<00:06:57.250> in<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.490> 15

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
I believe this is probably in the 15

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.770 
I believe this is probably in the 15
inch<00:06:58.600> range<00:06:59.520> then<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:01.990> we'll<00:07:02.200> just<00:07:02.380> save<00:07:02.590> it
