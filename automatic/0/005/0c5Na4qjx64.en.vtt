valve<00:01:48.310> was<00:01:48.490> stuck<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.910> know<00:01:48.940> tonight's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
valve was stuck you know tonight's

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.969

happened<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:49.930> freed<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.350> off<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.650> stopped<00:01:50.830> the

happened it freed it off and stopped the
fuel<00:01:51.220> leaking<00:01:51.460> out<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.570> should<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
fuel leaking out so I should think the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.230 
fuel leaking out so I should think the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
clean up if it does it again and there's

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.109

pushed it into place ever you actually
loose<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.560> need<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:15.489> something<00:02:15.730> with

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
loose so you need to do something with

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.949 
loose so you need to do something with
that<00:02:16.060> before<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.480> ride<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:19.720> got<00:02:19.870> some

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
that before you ride it it's got some

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.490 
that before you ride it it's got some
nice<00:02:20.110> sporty<00:02:20.500> exhaust<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:22.140> give<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.290> nice

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
nice sporty exhaust on it give it a nice

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.640 
nice sporty exhaust on it give it a nice
tone<00:02:27.030> thing<00:02:28.030> that's<00:02:28.180> probably<00:02:28.510> about<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.840> this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
tone thing that's probably about it this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.229 
tone thing that's probably about it this
thing<00:02:30.100> sounds<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> little<00:02:30.820> long<00:02:31.060> that's

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
thing sounds a little long that's

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.640 
thing sounds a little long that's
happening<00:02:31.660> side<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.959> think<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.230> probably<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.620> a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
happening side I think I probably have a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.890 
happening side I think I probably have a
look<00:02:32.770> at<00:02:32.920> those<00:02:33.040> before<00:02:33.250> sort<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.700> keep<00:02:34.630> using

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
look at those before sort of keep using

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.710 
look at those before sort of keep using
it<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.230> using<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.330> doesn't<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.510> how<00:02:37.570> is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
it and using it doesn't so how is

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.240 
it and using it doesn't so how is
anything<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.049> particular<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.680> sort<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.950> wants

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
anything in particular the sort of wants

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.770 
anything in particular the sort of wants
attention<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:39.940> there<00:02:40.120> other<00:02:40.330> than<00:02:40.600> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
attention in there other than that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.620 
attention in there other than that
really<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:42.430> bike<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.850> basically<00:02:43.390> all

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
really so the bike is basically all

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.350 
really so the bike is basically all
there<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.290> kind<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.739> as<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.670> see<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.180> kind

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
there is kind of as you see it it kind

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.699 
there is kind of as you see it it kind
of<00:02:46.420> want<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.750> bit<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.959> restoration<00:02:47.230> as<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.650> think

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
of want a bit of restoration as I think

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.590 
of want a bit of restoration as I think
it's<00:02:48.100> quite<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> rare<00:02:48.549> bike<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.209> anyway<00:02:49.480> if<00:02:49.540> you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
it's quite a rare bike but anyway if you

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.970 
it's quite a rare bike but anyway if you
got<00:02:49.690> any<00:02:49.780> questions<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.230> ask<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.799> I'll<00:02:50.830> tell
