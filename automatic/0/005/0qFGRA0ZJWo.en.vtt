00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
see so after this this was about I think

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.600 
see so after this this was about I think
July<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:13.260> year<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.739> think<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.070> started<00:03:14.489> in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
July this year I think I started in

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.190 
July this year I think I started in
March<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.269> enjoy<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.200> had<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.680> color<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
March and enjoy I had this color and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.440 
March and enjoy I had this color and
then<00:03:19.200> after<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:20.310> kind<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:21.000> kept<00:03:21.330> it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
then after that I just kind of kept it

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.490 
then after that I just kind of kept it
going<00:03:21.480> every<00:03:22.670> six<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:23.850> seven<00:03:24.209> eight<00:03:24.450> weeks<00:03:25.230> or

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
going every six or seven eight weeks or

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.400 
going every six or seven eight weeks or
so<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.709> touch<00:03:26.070> up<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> roots<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.989> kind<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.049> just

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.780 
happy but I also after every time I wash
it<00:03:44.310> which<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.210> like<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.630> said<00:03:45.690> once<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.230> week<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.790> I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
it which is like I said once a week I I

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.360 
it which is like I said once a week I I
put<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.720> lot<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.050> like<00:03:49.260> oils<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.310> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
put a lot of like oils in it and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
put a lot of like oils in it and
honestly<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.450> don't<00:03:51.750> even<00:03:51.870> know<00:03:52.080> what<00:03:52.260> kind<00:03:52.470> of

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.770 
honestly I don't even know what kind of
oils<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.670> assumed<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.270> since<00:03:54.630> their

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.100 
oils I just assumed that since their
oils<00:03:55.110> are<00:03:55.320> good<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.450> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.840> drench

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
because basically they all do the trick

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.530 
because basically they all do the trick
