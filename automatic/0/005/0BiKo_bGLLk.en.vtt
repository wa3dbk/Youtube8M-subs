Group A streptococcus Aaron gitis what's

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.089 
Group A streptococcus Aaron gitis what's
the<00:00:06.450> likelihood<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.290> organism<00:00:07.770> is

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the likelihood that this organism is

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.970 
the likelihood that this organism is
resistant<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.700> penicillin<00:00:09.679> zero<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.769> five

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.920 

okay<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.840> correct<00:00:28.140> answer<00:00:28.830> interestingly<00:00:29.930> is

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
okay the correct answer interestingly is

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.600 
okay the correct answer interestingly is
number<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.160> that's<00:00:32.279> great<00:00:32.550> that's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
number one and that's great that's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
number one and that's great that's
you've<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.450> about<00:00:33.780> 60%<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you've got about 60% of you got that and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
you've got about 60% of you got that and
that's<00:00:35.280> very<00:00:35.610> good<00:00:35.820> because<00:00:36.150> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> really

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that's very good because this is really

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.410 
that's very good because this is really
confusing<00:00:37.470> okay<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.400> just<00:00:38.430> talked<00:00:38.970> about<00:00:39.059> drug

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
confusing okay I just talked about drug

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.119

very intelligent and that we've been

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.760 
very intelligent and that we've been
pounding<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.600> penicillin<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.440> 50

years and it still hasn't figured out

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510

how to outsmart penicillin there's not a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.059 
how to outsmart penicillin there's not a

of other antibiotics but but amazingly

to penicillin there's zero resistance
which<00:02:00.690> is<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.050> good<00:02:01.229> news<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.679> is<00:02:02.520> very

which is very good news that is very

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.279 
which is very good news that is very
important<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.569> think<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:03.810> group

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
important to when you think about group
