00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi everyone these cube clouds 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.970
 welcome to a map whose principle 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.269
 is from the flash rebirth game is the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.679
 creator of this map is called raw is 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 coupaye protect or so I made a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.020
 mistake is doing lease leader in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.270
 under tech proulx to the map is reverse 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.720
 a little 8 is advised to be played in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.570
 14 doubles 0 5 pb to orbec game is 14.06 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 but I do not think it has a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.590
 importance to the principle is to be 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.460
 gone through 1.8 is not yet but I 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.079
 am in the shot room 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.899
 here is the map weighs 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.010
 not even 10 mega I do not know if the map 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.750
 is unlimited or if it stops at 9am on 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.299
 principle of the hibberd flaps since it is 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.670
 the principle of judo to stretch the matte 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.549
 you have to count a little bird a 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.619
 little pioupious and thanks to little pew 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.750
 you have to make sure of the 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.119
 keep in the air and make him 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.089
 so go there I'm in mode I'm going 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.460
 I had tested the ultra hard mode 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.450
 she magistrate difficult so it's 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:13.369
 two spaces we have two tubes I believe 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.830
 apparently two or three names of two 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.810
 tanks to pass the little kioukiou his 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.350
 have touched the column is enough 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.319
 difficult you will see easy level 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.179
 to start we have to go into 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.130
 wagons and before that you have to actually if 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.890
 you do not want to have edited your 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.060
 touches than the keys by winds that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.950
 of both groups a curate object of up 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.649
 Bath is an object, and you come home 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.849
 in the control option and so maybe 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.289
 point it's the ah here and in the mine 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.920
 kraft a badge use if you want 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.330
 know the key to the left of to 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.190
 right or backward backwards cs and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:00.920
 wakfu right by ahead is so it's 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.050
 the scud and the key is the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.679
 key drop it would n however by cons 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.640
 I do not know about you but in any case 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.350
 case for me to do to control the and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.630
 the best way to play minecraft 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.700
 dombes bresse to my little bit just he 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.410
 must configure your touch of 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.200
 rapid help to play this game otherwise 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.930
 you will not be able to be at 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.010
 comfortable oral dal lago makes you 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.709
 sound your level discuss so I have 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.200
 selected to keys the easy level 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.850
 ronald wagon press of a single button 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:44.690
 1 stone up until it's the key but 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:47.090
 with these facts here and in fact when we 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.510
 was able to touch it on demand at all its 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.120
 drops 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.420
 we have to turn here I come to see him 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.290
 are four stone buttons and actually 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.220
 every time we press it 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.720
 always we used stone button and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.340
 so when we no longer have I think the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.530
 game is over 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.810
 hop hop here is the mongie 5th point g 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.610
 I had two three castes and the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.489
 look there I could not cross 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.970
 because I made bullshit but 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.220
 you are you are 65 and that's it 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.110
 test an ultra difficult model up 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.769
 they themselves the number of stone buttons 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.200
 so that's not true I'm coming in 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.430
 I will try again gme had to manage that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.370
 but out of the same makes the effort and the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.600
 hard work that would be silly 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.970
 who wears me down on the button because 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.700
 that when I made the pope played 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.230
 pretty little bit ridiculous anyway 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.549
 intake will push him 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:53.030
 here is a dish hop here hop here is the level 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.490
 hard jim popp 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.380
 it's always 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.920
 yes a little bit understood I think the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.650
 system I attributed it to the makers of the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.320
 themes never to say but these 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.970
 time he did a lot of talking about him 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.320
 and there are a lot of people going 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.240
 break their phone because of that 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.900
 because it could be so much more than 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.820
 this game is so frustrating that if 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.260
 you play with your mobile phone 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.290
 You will soon understand why 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.360
 here I think I said everything 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.910
 mosaic repaired gross is guilty or 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.040
 take and you have a button for 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.640
 restart to achieve your score 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.140
 our scorecard up and there I have 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.310
 nothing 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.540
 Here we resigns everyone lives 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.540
 minecraft and see you next time
