interesting thing you can do on on a
fretless<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.630> special<00:01:27.840> effects

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
fretless is some of the special effects

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.310 
fretless is some of the special effects
you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.350> achieve<00:01:28.610> for<00:01:29.610> instance<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> you

you can achieve for instance you can you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
you can achieve for instance you can you
can<00:01:31.470> hit<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> harmonic<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
can hit like a harmonic and you can you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
can hit like a harmonic and you can you
can<00:01:36.689> slide<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.380> actually<00:01:37.680> slide

can slide it up you can actually slide

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
can slide it up you can actually slide
harmonics<00:01:38.369> back<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.939> that's<00:01:42.810> an<00:01:43.020> effect

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
harmonics back in and that's an effect

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
harmonics back in and that's an effect
that<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> violinists

that you you see a lot of violinists
will<00:01:45.689> use<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.079> chalice<00:01:46.409> especially<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> can

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
will use or chalice especially can I can

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.530 
will use or chalice especially can I can
get<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.210> effect<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> great<00:01:49.290> degree<00:01:50.540> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
get that effect to a great degree the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840 
get that effect to a great degree the
other<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.159> let's<00:01:53.759> say

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
other thing is that if you let's say

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
other thing is that if you let's say
let's<00:01:54.390> say<00:01:54.479> i'll<00:01:54.600> throw<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.869> maybe<00:01:55.409> some

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
let's say i'll throw in maybe some

top four strings you get into but you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
top four strings you get into but you
get<00:02:05.370> a<00:02:05.430> very<00:02:05.580> acoustic<00:02:06.210> bass<00:02:06.360> types<00:02:06.720> not

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
get a very acoustic bass types not

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:25.040 
get a very acoustic bass types not
tellin<00:02:07.290> almost<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:24.930> you

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
over driver distortion you can really

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.550 
over driver distortion you can really
get<00:04:00.690> some

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
get some

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:15.500
