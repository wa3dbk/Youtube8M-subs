00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.090

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 there was no 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.320
 phone and already long ago crashed as

 we see the film is all right 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.470
 on the other hand 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.259
 let's try how it works by 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 to mine it just sounds protective 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.990
 means that each user 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.990
 must have to protect starve apparatus 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.770
 reflect the apparatus almost intact 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.100
 even though I'm pretty strong 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.100
 will kill 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.380
 even now he still continues 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.440
 give signs of life button 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.120
 I can almost see the forecast there 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.530
 weather 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.910
 let's remove the battery because 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.040
 the battery still does not protect 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:16.970
 no film and all electronic 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:18.880

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.160
