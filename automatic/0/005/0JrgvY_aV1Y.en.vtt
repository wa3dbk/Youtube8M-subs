00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:22.789

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.769
 but Saturday 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.189
 and under a jet of hot water we remove the surface salt if 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.629
 We put in a pot with a liter and a half of water approximately accompanied by 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.590
 a few grains of biological laurel pepper was going to be an hour on fire 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.870
 slow pyrite and beaches present about 20 minutes some on the other hand we are going to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.989

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 we also need more cool we take off the clothes 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 it is the hardest 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.680

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 in September 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.710
 and also the reserved 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.990
 dick finally we have appealed a couple of potatoes 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.920

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.780

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.869
 the potato 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.090
 rancid pork what is called a tour 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.559
 It is not the same as butter because it is fast but good everything depends 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.079
