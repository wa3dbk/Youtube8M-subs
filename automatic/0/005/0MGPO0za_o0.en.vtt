this and that is going to add to your
recording<00:00:42.000> time<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.690> only<00:00:42.870> problem<00:00:43.200> with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
recording time the only problem with

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
recording time the only problem with
this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.100> are<00:00:44.820> limited<00:00:45.239> than<00:00:45.690> with

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
this is that you are limited than with

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.600 
this is that you are limited than with
your<00:00:46.610> sections<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.969> only<00:00:48.300> four<00:00:48.809> obviously

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
your sections to only four obviously

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.040 
your sections to only four obviously
they're<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.730> another<00:00:51.239> problem<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
they're not another problem with this is

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
they're not another problem with this is
that<00:00:52.230> you'll<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.770> recording<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:53.910> once

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that you'll be recording and then once

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
that you'll be recording and then once
the<00:00:54.480> time<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> stops<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.520> be

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the time is up it stops which can be

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
the time is up it stops which can be
really<00:00:56.910> annoying<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.780> here's<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.770> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
really annoying so here's the way to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.639 
really annoying so here's the way to
record<00:00:59.340> without<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.000> stopping<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.530> gonna

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
record without it stopping so I'm gonna

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.060 
record without it stopping so I'm gonna
delete<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:05.570> then<00:01:06.619> what<00:01:07.619> I'm<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
delete these and then what I'm going to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.770 
delete these and then what I'm going to
do<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:09.000> simple<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:10.170> hit<00:01:10.439> section<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
do is really simple I just hit section a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
do is really simple I just hit section a
and<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.770> says<00:01:13.920> automatic<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.909> off

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and where it says automatic how it's off

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
and where it says automatic how it's off
you're<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.110> turn<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> now

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you're just gonna turn that on and now

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.010 
you're just gonna turn that on and now
you<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.420> able<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> record<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.509> long<00:01:21.810> as

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you are able to record for as long as

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
you are able to record for as long as
you<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> time<00:01:23.430> limit<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you want now there is a time limit of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170 
you want now there is a time limit of
about<00:01:24.330> three<00:01:24.750> hours<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.950> due<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
about three hours that's just due to the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.010 
about three hours that's just due to the
app<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.740> amount<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> time<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
app and the amount of time it has but I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.499 
app and the amount of time it has but I
mean<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:32.070> you'll<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.460> singing<00:01:33.150> for

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
mean I don't think you'll be singing for

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.460 
mean I don't think you'll be singing for
a<00:01:33.540> whole<00:01:33.750> three<00:01:34.049> hours<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.820> it's<00:01:36.170> pretty<00:01:37.170> cool

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
a whole three hours so it's pretty cool

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490 
a whole three hours so it's pretty cool
and<00:01:38.509> normally<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.689> stop<00:01:40.049> right<00:01:40.259> there

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and normally it would stop right there

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.190 
and normally it would stop right there
but<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.150> keeps<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.840> which

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
but as you can see it keeps going which

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
but as you can see it keeps going which
is<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.680> nice<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> record<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is really nice if you want to record a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
is really nice if you want to record a
full<00:01:45.299> song<00:01:45.570> without<00:01:45.899> having<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> worry<00:01:46.470> about

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
full song without having to worry about

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.440 
full song without having to worry about
getting<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> timing<00:01:47.850> right<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.270> anything

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
getting the timing right or anything

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
getting the timing right or anything
like<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.280> you're<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.490> done

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like that and then when you're all done

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.630 
like that and then when you're all done
all<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.659> hit<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.320> stop<00:01:52.950> button<00:01:52.979> and
