00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
at the exact same time

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.410 
at the exact same time
and<00:00:46.930> that's<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.710> way<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:48.250> can<00:00:48.460> change<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.390> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
and that's the way you can change to the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.560 
and that's the way you can change to the
weapon<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:49.960> your<00:00:50.110> choice<00:00:50.699> in<00:00:51.699> this<00:00:52.000> case<00:00:52.329> I

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
weapon of your choice in this case I

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.959 
weapon of your choice in this case I
decided<00:00:53.020> I<00:00:53.530> wanted<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.070> fighting<00:00:54.699> with<00:00:54.820> the

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
decided I wanted to fighting with the

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:55.619 
decided I wanted to fighting with the
shard

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
shard

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.200 
shard
so<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.230> I<00:00:56.260> looked<00:00:56.620> more<00:00:56.949> like<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.640> iron

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
so that I looked more like the iron

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.139 
so that I looked more like the iron
guard<00:00:58.949> even<00:00:59.949> though<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.460> didn't<00:01:00.879> have<00:01:00.910> the

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
guard even though I didn't have the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.770 
guard even though I didn't have the
shield<00:01:01.510> but<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.920> shard<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.519> your<00:01:03.940> weapons

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
shield but the shard is your weapons

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.770 
shield but the shard is your weapons
so<00:01:05.410> that's<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.950> way<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.160> can<00:01:06.780> choose

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
so that's the way you can choose

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.700 
so that's the way you can choose
whichever<00:01:08.770> weapon<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.580> want<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:11.110> tap<00:01:11.440> the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
whichever weapon you want just tap the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.490 
whichever weapon you want just tap the
blue<00:01:11.920> circle<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.119> sword<00:01:13.420> at<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.840> top<00:01:14.080> and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
blue circle and the sword at the top and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.700 
blue circle and the sword at the top and
then<00:01:15.430> when<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.700> go<00:01:15.850> back<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.450> fight<00:01:16.720> it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
then when you go back to the fight it's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.609 
then when you go back to the fight it's
straight<00:01:18.520> into<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.030> fight<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.290> can<00:01:20.470> do

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
straight into the fight and you can do

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.760 
straight into the fight and you can do
the<00:01:20.799> same<00:01:21.070> with<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.670> sky<00:01:21.970> cage<00:01:22.330> Titans<00:01:23.049> if<00:01:23.470> you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the same with the sky cage Titans if you

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.910 
the same with the sky cage Titans if you
don't<00:01:24.009> want<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.490> use<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.750> weapons<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.500> they

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
don't want to use the weapons that they

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.999 
don't want to use the weapons that they
require<00:01:27.400> again<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.630> need<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.869> have<00:01:29.110> them<00:01:29.680> quit

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
require again you need to have them quit

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.880 
require again you need to have them quit
before<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.729> tap<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.390> blue<00:01:31.600> circle<00:01:32.229> ends<00:01:32.590> at

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
before you tap the blue circle ends at

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.179 
before you tap the blue circle ends at
the<00:01:33.009> top<00:01:33.040> sword<00:01:33.820> at<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.420> exact<00:01:34.900> same<00:01:35.229> time<00:01:35.680> so

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
the top sword at the exact same time so

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.760

I<00:01:36.939> can't<00:01:37.210> show<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.840> rest<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.170> my<00:01:38.320> fight

with me I get through him quite quickly

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.899

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
because I have a high attack and here he

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.880 
because I have a high attack and here he
is<00:01:46.030> doing<00:01:46.299> one<00:01:46.509> who<00:01:46.689> step<00:01:47.020> backs<00:01:47.290> which<00:01:47.649> is<00:01:47.860> a

is doing one who step backs which is a

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.490 
is doing one who step backs which is a
double<00:01:48.369> dodge<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.210> right<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.840> then<00:01:50.170> two

double dodge to the right and then two

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.639 
double dodge to the right and then two
ducks<00:01:50.860> I've<00:01:51.790> got<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.149> video<00:01:52.420> on<00:01:52.689> lead<00:01:53.259> step

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
ducks I've got a video on lead step

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.679 
ducks I've got a video on lead step
backs<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.640> might<00:01:54.850> want<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.149> check<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.450> out

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
backs you might want to check that out

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
backs you might want to check that out
if<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.649> want<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.920> see<00:01:57.219> them<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.700> more<00:01:58.090> detail

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
if you want to see them in more detail

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.490 
if you want to see them in more detail
the<00:02:00.880> good<00:02:01.090> thing<00:02:01.329> about<00:02:01.360> reap<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:02.079> you<00:02:02.290> can

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
the good thing about reap is you can

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.929 
the good thing about reap is you can
carry<00:02:02.890> all<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.579> his<00:02:03.759> moves<00:02:04.090> except<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.500> kick

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
carry all of his moves except the kick

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.620 
carry all of his moves except the kick
so<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.270> recommend<00:02:08.049> getting<00:02:08.350> used<00:02:08.739> to

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
so I recommend getting used to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.190 
so I recommend getting used to
smooth<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.500> he<00:02:10.860> becomes<00:02:11.310> quite<00:02:12.090> easy<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
smooth because he becomes quite easy to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.070 
smooth because he becomes quite easy to
finish<00:02:13.710> off<00:02:14.070> once<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.850> are<00:02:15.240> familiar<00:02:15.570> with

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
finish off once you are familiar with

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.350 
finish off once you are familiar with
him<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.990> dodge<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.950> last<00:02:20.190> hit<00:02:20.850> then

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
him and if you dodge the last hit then

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.710 
him and if you dodge the last hit then
you'll<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.080> longer<00:02:22.380> break<00:02:22.830> window<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.390> if

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you'll get a longer break window and if

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.740 
you'll get a longer break window and if
you<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.080> perfect<00:02:25.710> Paris<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.300> can<00:02:27.480> ads

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
you get perfect Paris then you can ads

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.320 
you get perfect Paris then you can ads
attacks<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:29.040> brake<00:02:29.250> window<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.180> that

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
attacks to your brake window so in that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.970 
attacks to your brake window so in that
case<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.020> got<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.340> step<00:02:32.880> back<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:34.170> wasn't<00:02:34.770> hit

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
case I got a step back and I wasn't hit

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.060 
case I got a step back and I wasn't hit
so<00:02:35.370> there's<00:02:35.550> four<00:02:35.910> exclamation<00:02:36.780> marks<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
so there's four exclamation marks and I

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.850 
so there's four exclamation marks and I
also<00:02:38.280> got<00:02:38.640> two<00:02:38.970> perfect<00:02:39.480> pairings<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.170> that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
also got two perfect pairings so that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.070 
also got two perfect pairings so that
meant<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.340> could<00:02:41.670> attack<00:02:42.330> him<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:42.780> eight

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
meant I could attack him with eight

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.210 
meant I could attack him with eight
combos<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:44.670> an<00:02:45.180> ultra<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.040> can

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
combos and then an ultra and you can

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.000 
combos and then an ultra and you can
definitely<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.820> through<00:02:48.090> him<00:02:48.360> faster<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
definitely get through him faster the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.360 
definitely get through him faster the
more<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:51.390> perfect<00:02:51.900> parries<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.590> also

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
more you get perfect parries and also

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.440 
more you get perfect parries and also
dodge<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.570> last<00:02:54.810> hit<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:56.450> definitely

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
dodge the last hit I definitely

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.550 
dodge the last hit I definitely
recommend<00:02:57.840> using<00:02:58.440> your<00:02:58.740> weapons<00:02:59.640> with<00:03:00.090> me

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
recommend using your weapons with me

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.960 
recommend using your weapons with me
because<00:03:01.560> then<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.950> don't<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.760> any

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
because then you don't have to have any

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.110 
because then you don't have to have any
stats<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.810> shield<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.610> if<00:03:05.610> you're<00:03:05.850> playing

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
stats in shield and if you're playing

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.440 
stats in shield and if you're playing
new<00:03:06.450> game<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.590> higher<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:07.890> higher<00:03:08.400> up

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
new game and going higher and higher up

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.040 
new game and going higher and higher up
then<00:03:09.450> he<00:03:10.110> gets<00:03:10.380> rather<00:03:11.040> almost<00:03:11.910> impossible<00:03:12.630> to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
then he gets rather almost impossible to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.980 
then he gets rather almost impossible to
defeat<00:03:13.860> if<00:03:14.250> you're<00:03:14.550> using<00:03:14.940> sword<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.720> shield

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
defeat if you're using sword and shield

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.670 
defeat if you're using sword and shield
or<00:03:16.320> heavy<00:03:17.000> because<00:03:18.000> he<00:03:18.360> takes<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.960> many<00:03:19.140> points

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
or heavy because he takes so many points

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.520 
or heavy because he takes so many points
of<00:03:19.860> your<00:03:19.890> shield<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:21.480> isn't<00:03:21.930> actually

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
of your shield it isn't actually

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.730 
of your shield it isn't actually
impossible<00:03:22.860> because<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.710> use<00:03:25.710> a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
impossible because you can use a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.790 
impossible because you can use a
combination<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.850> gems<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.630> also<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.500> lot<00:03:28.770> of

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
combination of gems and also a lot of

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.150 
combination of gems and also a lot of
stat<00:03:29.520> points<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.240> your<00:03:30.750> shield<00:03:31.050> but<00:03:31.890> it's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
stat points in your shield but it's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.930 
stat points in your shield but it's
definitely<00:03:32.400> very<00:03:33.030> hard<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.600> way<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
definitely very hard that way and so the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.300 
definitely very hard that way and so the
sooner<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.360> get<00:03:36.690> used<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.170> fighting<00:03:37.800> him<00:03:38.040> with

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
sooner you get used to fighting him with

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.000 
sooner you get used to fighting him with
your<00:03:38.580> weapons<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.720> easier<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.650> will<00:03:40.800> be<00:03:40.980> for

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
your weapons the easier it will be for

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.930 
your weapons the easier it will be for
you<00:03:41.370> as<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.970> go<00:03:42.150> up<00:03:42.180> higher<00:03:42.780> new<00:03:43.080> games<00:03:43.940> he

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you as you go up higher new games he

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.030 
you as you go up higher new games he
gives<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.300> lot<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.510> XP<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.530> he's<00:03:46.740> definitely

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
gives a lot of XP so he's definitely

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.449 
gives a lot of XP so he's definitely
worth<00:03:47.670> fighting<00:03:48.240> in<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.500> case<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:50.070> didn't

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
worth fighting in this case I didn't

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.160 
worth fighting in this case I didn't
have<00:03:50.640> any<00:03:50.970> XP<00:03:51.840> games<00:03:52.200> or<00:03:52.940> potion<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.900> Y<00:03:54.930> only
