you'd have to look out for the wardens
or<00:00:53.839> Rangers<00:00:54.320> Rangers<00:00:54.500> Rangers<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:55.820> on

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
or Rangers Rangers Rangers and so on

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.719 
or Rangers Rangers Rangers and so on
make<00:00:57.290> sure<00:00:57.470> that<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:57.739> didn't<00:00:58.010> hear<00:00:58.129> swearing

yeah I think that was the the birthplace
of<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.739> idea<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:05.210> then<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:06.860> Pat<00:01:07.189> for

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
of the idea and then of Pat for

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:33.580 
of the idea and then of Pat for
