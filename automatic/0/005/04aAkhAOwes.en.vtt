00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
all of these appliances are functional

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.369 
all of these appliances are functional
they<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.620> open<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.780> inside<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
they actually open and inside is the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100 
they actually open and inside is the
Dutch<00:01:01.590> oven<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.430> underneath<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.359> sink<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Dutch oven and underneath the sink is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.859 
Dutch oven and underneath the sink is
sopan<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.060> tight<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.750> can't

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
sopan but it's so tight in there I can't

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
sopan but it's so tight in there I can't
really<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.860> better<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.400> take<00:01:08.549> pictures<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
really it's better to take pictures and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010 
really it's better to take pictures and
and<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.030> close-ups<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and and get the the close-ups then to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
and and get the the close-ups then to
actually<00:01:13.369> video<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.880> hand<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.420> be

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
actually video because my hand will be

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
actually video because my hand will be
in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.950> quick<00:01:17.100> overview<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
in the way so just a quick overview that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.280 
in the way so just a quick overview that
this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> kitchen<00:01:18.900> area<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.960> then<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this is the kitchen area and then the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.070 
this is the kitchen area and then the
the<00:01:22.770> Fourier<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.090> small<00:01:27.299> skinny

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the Fourier is just this small skinny

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.249 
the Fourier is just this small skinny
hallway<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> porch<00:01:33.150> isn't<00:01:33.600> done<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
hallway and the porch isn't done the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
hallway and the porch isn't done the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
flooring isn't done on this and neither

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.920 
flooring isn't done on this and neither
is<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.380> roof<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> next<00:01:38.909> I'll<00:01:39.240> show<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.540> the

items<00:04:34.230> so<00:04:34.800> anyway<00:04:35.670> this<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.600> only

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
bathroom in the house and I'm working on

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.460 
bathroom in the house and I'm working on
next<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.610> Fourier<00:04:42.000> there's<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.480> unused

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
next to the Fourier there's a unused

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.420 
next to the Fourier there's a unused
broom<00:04:44.270> storage<00:04:45.320> closet<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.410> guess<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:47.280> just

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
broom storage closet I guess it's just

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.880 
broom storage closet I guess it's just
underneath<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.030> stair<00:04:48.480> it<00:04:48.870> has<00:04:49.260> like<00:04:49.470> an<00:04:49.620> eve

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
underneath the stair it has like an eve

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.880 
underneath the stair it has like an eve
because<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.790> stairs<00:04:51.420> are<00:04:51.750> planting<00:04:52.710> the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
because of the stairs are planting the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.940 
because of the stairs are planting the
the<00:04:53.310> roof<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.820> it's<00:04:54.600> it's<00:04:54.960> very<00:04:55.200> narrow<00:04:55.590> it's

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
the roof and it's it's very narrow it's

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.810 
the roof and it's it's very narrow it's
probably<00:04:56.550> about<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.750> narrow<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.440> I'm<00:04:59.310> just

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
probably about that narrow and I'm just

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.190 
probably about that narrow and I'm just
planning<00:05:00.000> on<00:05:00.240> turning<00:05:00.420> it<00:05:00.690> into<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.930> powder

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
planning on turning it into a powder
