super<00:01:19.170> Miele<00:01:19.409> methane<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.030> natural<00:01:21.450> so

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
super Miele methane that's a natural so

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.999 
super Miele methane that's a natural so
for<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:23.750> actually<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.990> plants<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.770> all

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
for that actually all plants and all

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
for that actually all plants and all
human<00:01:26.909> bodies<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.810> animal<00:01:28.320> bodies<00:01:29.600> so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
far is a very important component of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.969 
far is a very important component of
life<00:01:33.810> actually<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.890> also<00:01:35.369> base<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.909> life<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
life actually it's also base of life and

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.289 
life actually it's also base of life and
so<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.720> MSM<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> natural<00:01:41.460> substance

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so the MSM is a is a natural substance

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.039 
so the MSM is a is a natural substance
in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
in

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
in
name's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.680> sunnatullah'<00:01:44.250> chemical<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
name's the sunnatullah' chemical that is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.109 
name's the sunnatullah' chemical that is
a<00:01:45.119> natural<00:01:45.689> substance<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.920> our<00:01:47.369> body<00:01:47.700> needs

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
a natural substance then our body needs

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.039 
a natural substance then our body needs
and<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:49.710> magic<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> does<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.479> why<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and the magic that it does and why I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
and the magic that it does and why I
wanna<00:01:52.439> share<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.219> is<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.789> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
wanna share it with you is that it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
wanna share it with you is that it
actually<00:01:54.600> does<00:01:55.229> help<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:58.500> lower<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
actually does help to to lower the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.600 
actually does help to to lower the
pressure<00:01:59.640> in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.450> cells<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.020> our<00:02:01.140> body<00:02:01.610> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
pressure in the cells in our body it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.590 
pressure in the cells in our body it
helps<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.740> make<00:02:04.850> transformation<00:02:05.850> from<00:02:06.030> inside

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
helps to make transformation from inside

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.479 
helps to make transformation from inside
to<00:02:06.840> outside<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.500> cell<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.009> make<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.340> more

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
to outside of the cell to make that more

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.759 
to outside of the cell to make that more
smooth<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.060> make<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.509> easy<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.080> for

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
smooth to make that more easy and for

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.559 
smooth to make that more easy and for
example<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.519> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.819> migraine<00:02:12.390> or

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
example if you have migraine or

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.020 
example if you have migraine or
headaches<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.349> often<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.190> caused<00:02:14.549> by<00:02:14.849> having

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
headaches that often is caused by having

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.750 
headaches that often is caused by having
an<00:02:15.299> overpressure<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.440> head<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.459> if<00:02:17.640> you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
an overpressure in your head so if you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.750 
an overpressure in your head so if you
take<00:02:18.000> Soflo<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.660> take<00:02:18.900> MSM<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:20.010> has<00:02:20.310> helped

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
take Soflo if you take MSM it has helped

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.330 
take Soflo if you take MSM it has helped
to<00:02:20.819> release<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.780> pressure<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.680> into

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to release that pressure you have into

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.990 
to release that pressure you have into
the<00:02:23.459> cells<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.269> head<00:02:24.569> actually<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:26.000> this
