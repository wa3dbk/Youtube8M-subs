300<00:00:09.280> Mbps<00:00:09.580> network<00:00:10.300> is<00:00:10.540> twice<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.290> speed<00:00:11.590> of

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:11.890 
300 Mbps network is twice the speed of

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.600 
300 Mbps network is twice the speed of
the<00:00:12.100> current<00:00:12.250> 4G<00:00:13.320> 150<00:00:14.320> Mbps<00:00:14.560> network<00:00:15.100> as<00:00:15.280> you

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
the current 4G 150 Mbps network as you

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.099 
the current 4G 150 Mbps network as you
can<00:00:15.730> see<00:00:15.940> on<00:00:16.090> our<00:00:16.150> hoopla<00:00:16.480> app<00:00:16.630> here

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
can see on our hoopla app here

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.739 
can see on our hoopla app here
so<00:00:17.499> to<00:00:17.560> give<00:00:17.859> this<00:00:17.980> new<00:00:18.160> speed<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.699> test<00:00:19.179> run<00:00:19.419> we

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:19.749 
so to give this new speed a test run we

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.540 
so to give this new speed a test run we
decided<00:00:20.169> to<00:00:20.289> let<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.529> public<00:00:20.710> try<00:00:21.310> it<00:00:21.369> out

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
decided to let the public try it out

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.839 
decided to let the public try it out
let's<00:00:21.880> come<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.140> OL<00:00:23.259> network<00:00:23.619> is<00:00:23.769> 4G<00:00:24.039> 150

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
let's come on the OL network is 4G 150

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:25.349 
let's come on the OL network is 4G 150

think<00:00:29.199> you<00:00:29.259> guys<00:00:29.439> to<00:00:29.679> do<00:00:30.069> the<00:00:30.159> speed<00:00:30.339> test<00:00:30.579> for

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:30.819 
think you guys to do the speed test for

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:39.860 
think you guys to do the speed test for
us<00:00:30.999> Wow<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.839> read<00:00:32.230> 80<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:35.680> pretty<00:00:35.890> good
