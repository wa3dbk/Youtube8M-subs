drink and I've been taking the B shake

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.360 
drink and I've been taking the B shake
shake<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:10.200> reason<00:00:10.530> I've<00:00:10.650> been<00:00:10.679> taking<00:00:11.190> this

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
shake the reason I've been taking this

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.709 
shake the reason I've been taking this
is<00:00:11.639> they've<00:00:12.269> got<00:00:13.700> tri-sorb<00:00:14.700> blended<00:00:15.480> protein

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
is they've got tri-sorb blended protein

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.670 
is they've got tri-sorb blended protein
which<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.730> it's<00:00:17.730> soy<00:00:18.000> protein<00:00:18.570> without<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
which is it's soy protein without the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.720 
which is it's soy protein without the
isoflavones<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.920> chemical<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
isoflavones which is the chemical in a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
isoflavones which is the chemical in a
lot<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.910> sway<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.420> produces<00:00:24.869> estrogen<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
lot of sway that produces estrogen the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.160 
lot of sway that produces estrogen the
reason<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.730> put<00:00:26.760> soy<00:00:27.119> protein<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
reason they put soy protein in there is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
reason they put soy protein in there is
to<00:00:28.580> help<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.730> heart<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.410> also<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:33.149> kind<00:00:33.329> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's got a whey isolate which is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's got a whey isolate which is
basically<00:00:39.840> super<00:00:40.079> concentrated<00:00:40.890> whey

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
basically super concentrated whey

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.549 
basically super concentrated whey
protein<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.850> gets<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.200> muscles

faster and then it's got the other form

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.350 
faster and then it's got the other form
of<00:00:47.280> whey<00:00:47.910> protein<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:49.020> for

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
of whey protein which is good for

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.439 
of whey protein which is good for
burning<00:00:51.360> calories<00:00:52.190> losing<00:00:53.190> fat<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.460> stuff<00:00:53.910> so

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
clean glass so this stuff is like it

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.309 
clean glass so this stuff is like it
comes<00:02:13.370> out<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:14.090> light<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.690> easy<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.050> take

comes out really light and easy to take
down<00:02:15.380> that's<00:02:15.800> not<00:02:15.890> thick<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> lot<00:02:16.880> of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
down that's not thick like a lot of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.900 
down that's not thick like a lot of
protein<00:02:17.360> ones<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:20.989> milk<00:02:21.910> so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
protein ones it's just like milk so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.900 
protein ones it's just like milk so
that's<00:02:23.030> really<00:02:23.239> good<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:27.319> uh<00:02:27.349> if<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.610> helps
