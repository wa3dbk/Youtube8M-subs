material we strive it's not necessary to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.800 
material we strive it's not necessary to
put<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.890> much<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.750> if

you have it in abundance you can use
soil<00:01:10.110> mix<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.680> compost<00:01:11.280> material<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.270> on

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
soil mix with compost material and so on

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
soil mix with compost material and so on
but<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> need<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> ensure<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.250> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
but all you need to ensure that your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
but all you need to ensure that your
soil<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.600> retaining<00:01:15.869> moisture<00:01:16.320> at

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
soil is good at retaining moisture at

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
soil is good at retaining moisture at
least<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.400> pleased<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.479> retaining

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
least not pleased or just retaining

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
least not pleased or just retaining
moisture<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.860> definitely<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.759> want<00:01:21.030> clay

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
moisture you definitely do not want clay

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510 
moisture you definitely do not want clay
so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> definitely<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.860> clay<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so you definitely do not want clay so it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
so you definitely do not want clay so it
will<00:01:23.820> cause<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> SAP<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.689> key<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> rocks

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
will cause the SAP to the key and rocks

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
will cause the SAP to the key and rocks
because<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.920> side<00:01:26.130> they're<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.520> soft<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
because this side they're very soft this

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.310 
because this side they're very soft this
one<00:01:27.150> should<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.630> everything<00:01:28.140> by<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
one should be well everything by the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160 
one should be well everything by the
same<00:01:28.560> time<00:01:28.770> able<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.159> retain<00:01:29.430> moisture<00:01:30.170> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
same time able to retain moisture so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.190 
same time able to retain moisture so
let's<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.159> ahead<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:33.450> Josefa<00:01:33.960> so

I may not have enough to fill the entire
quit<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.439> gonna<00:01:52.640> improvise<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> try<00:01:54.119> my

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
quit so I'm gonna improvise and try my

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:16.119 
quit so I'm gonna improvise and try my
best<00:01:54.649> with<00:01:55.649> any<00:01:55.799> nice<00:01:56.130> orderly<00:01:56.490> Kasia

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.970 

it's<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.150> an<00:02:17.299> equation<00:02:17.599> because<00:02:18.019> they<00:02:18.829> no

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
it's like an equation because they no

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.780 
it's like an equation because they no
longer<00:02:19.040> uses<00:02:19.610> crits<00:02:20.829> and<00:02:21.829> it's<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.189> this<00:02:22.310> type

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
longer uses crits and it's not this type

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.899
