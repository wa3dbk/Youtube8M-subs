00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.620
 must be given 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.220
 one of the most powerful weapons that i 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.990
 poker players have available 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.720
 to make money is the bet to make 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 pass the opponent but on which tables 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.890
 of poker pros have more fold equity on 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.720
 online tables or live ones 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.250
 we ask a player who is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.410
 specialized in both disciplines 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.930
 carlo savinelli good evening to all 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 I think that basically being the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.190
 live movie feed easier than the weapon of the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.879
 foundry is more usable during the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.769
 live tournaments 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.750
 maybe even in tournaments 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.250
 online really maybe special sandi 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.059
 Sunday tournaments because usually 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.370
 when playing tournaments 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.879
 mostly crowded with reg 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.530
 certainly the component is smaller 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.420
 fewer advantages that had to have the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 reference to fold equity while live 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.049
 however it is precisely the territory 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.760
 unexplored people pass a lot 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.290
 mixed of the spots and huge that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 basically above two 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.159
 on day 3 in the suburb area or towards the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 end of the day in fold equity a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 moments exponentially because 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.990
 today I want to end the day 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 wants to go to prizes or is afraid of 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.650
 young people a big plate then 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.860
 basically i think live is 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.680
 truly a source of respect 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 instead to the poor light talking about fold 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.250
 equity playing live the talk is it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.700
 same if we talk about cash or in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.260
 cash and the desire to see us flops and curtains 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.880
 to reduce this margin 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.200
 I think it 's almost the opposite because 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.360
 that the live game 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.980
 being an easier field than 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 the one of the online the fall debts e 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.830
 lower because people inside a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.930
 play many more flops a lot more 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.870
 because basically my skills 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.490
 a few games a little randomly so not 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.200
 tend to pass while two inside 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.590
 of the tournament they want to pass because 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.240
 want to get to day 2 tm enough to 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.710
 enter even play live have the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.180
 ability to recharge and then 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.010
 keep to play the bordeaux then 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.850
 eliminating completely in the face of 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.850
 these who invented
