00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hey, then 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.280
 Male vs pin mark try 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.960
 In fact, it's more like a backyard sample 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.880
 The next pin comes from Ashley with over 100 likes 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.840
 It's the water blob 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.120
 That has been scattered around at pinterest this summer 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.500
 Originally taken from Clumsy Crafter, this pin suggests taking a plastic press and some gaff tape 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.880
 to make this van blob 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.300
 However, another pin from Homemade Toast suggests using an iron to secure the plastic together 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.160
 As I thought, a lot more made sense 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.940
 I bought a roll of plastic from a hardware store 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.640
 I chose the thickest that was 6.0 miles 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.600
 And, for safety's sake, some gaff loss 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.840
 Then I found some baking paper and folded it in the middle 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.440
 And drew a line 5 cm from the fold 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 It will help to make it more consistent when the plastic is to be assembled 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.520
 Then I rolled out the plate and cut a large piece that I got folded in the middle 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.540
 Alright, we'll put some water in it 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 Well, I'm glad you asked 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.560
 After lining all the sides up, I placed the baking paper around the sides 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.160
 And with my iron screwed up completely, I started putting the plastic together 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.980
 That actually only takes a few seconds when you stroke it a few times 

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:10.033
 And voila! 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.480
 Remember to give it a few seconds to cool 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.700
 And as you can see here we now have this composite plastic edge 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 After that I just moved my baking paper along the edge and put the last three pages together 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.940
 And I thought it would take forever, but the whole process took me about 15 minutes 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.360
 Just before I came to the end, I left a small hole open and big enough that my garden hose could be there 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.280
 Mmm .. It didn't sound right 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.200
 I checked all my edges before I took it all and went outside again 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.120
 After putting it into the garden, I took the garden hose and started filling it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060
 So you can stand there like an idiot for 20 minutes while it gets filled up 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.560
 or 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.860
 You can support it on a chair 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.820
 Your choice 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.320
 So, I warn you 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.360
 The hardest part of the whole project is probably expectation from young children 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.560
 Which apparently is completely unbearable 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.100
 Is it ready now? 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.940
 It's not ready yet, it hasn't been ready in the last 20 minutes 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.480
 About halfway I put some blue fruit color in, which made it look pretty cool 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.260
 "Looks like the room!" 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.682
 Or as the room 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 When it was full, I taped the hole with some gaff tape and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.620
 "Is it ready?" 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.360
 It's ready! 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.940
 We had given these kids a lot of energy before we let go of them to see how long it really took 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.080
 Under intense conditions 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.320
 This is cool! 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 There was some hopping 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 There were some water-blob angels 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.060
 Something arkobatik 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.640
 Some .. ah .. Some babies 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.920
 All in all, it lasted about, mmmm, 10 minutes before the first hole came 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
 Alright, we have hole # 1 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.000
 and it wasn't that bad, just a few small holes 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.760
 A few of them jumped forward in the first few minutes, but with some tape, it was not a problem 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560
 "What doesn't help! 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.600
 "Ah, there is one more" 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.120
 Ah, yep, you just made it bigger 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.960
 But all the gaff tape in the world can't help you when a child is instinctively pilling things 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.440
 "I make holes. I love you, hole!" 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700
 "It looks like it is peeing" 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.100
 Oh, yea, yeah, it's wet now 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.700
 And .. The water blob has been compromised 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 Which is not necessarily a bad thing 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.380
 It gave a little water the blob a new life after the children's start happiness disappeared 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.260
 IT IS SATISFIED 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.460
 Now it's just become a small pool 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 Or .. a water hole 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.420
 Whatever you prefer, apparently it tastes good 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.960
 All in all, lived the good 3 hours, I would say 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.380
 Water the blob, reasonably successful, get a piece of gaff tape here and there, but or super good 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.840
 Leave one you know, some fun pins for the summer in the comments and we'll see you next time 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.240
 Children. &lt;3
