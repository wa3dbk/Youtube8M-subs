00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
from a six plus the case doesn't feel

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.970 
from a six plus the case doesn't feel
all<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> big<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.570> terms<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> length<00:00:52.350> it's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
all that big in terms of length it's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.590 
all that big in terms of length it's
pretty<00:00:53.190> comfortable<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> my<00:00:53.789> pocket<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pretty comfortable in my pocket and in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.270 
pretty comfortable in my pocket and in
my<00:00:54.750> hand<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> since<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.860> wide<00:00:56.100> as

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
my hand and since it's not as wide as

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
my hand and since it's not as wide as
the<00:00:56.399> six<00:00:56.610> plus<00:00:56.850> reaching<00:00:57.329> across<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> screen

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the six plus reaching across the screen

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
the six plus reaching across the screen
is<00:00:58.289> still<00:00:58.620> relatively<00:00:59.039> easy<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
is still relatively easy so with this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.790 
is still relatively easy so with this
case<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> adds<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> weight<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
case on it adds a bit of weight which I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.349 
case on it adds a bit of weight which I
kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.309> letting<00:01:02.640> me<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.120> have

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
kind of like letting me know that I have

seconds to turn on or off the battery

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.190 
seconds to turn on or off the battery
isn't<00:02:26.730> bad<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.420> would<00:02:27.660> rather<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
switch there rather than holding bun for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
switch there rather than holding bun for
a<00:02:30.210> few<00:02:30.480> seconds<00:02:30.900> it'll<00:02:31.140> make<00:02:31.380> my<00:02:31.560> life<00:02:31.740> easier

a few seconds it'll make my life easier
and<00:02:32.310> turning<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.180> battery<00:02:33.450> case<00:02:33.750> much

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and turning on the battery case much

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.750 
and turning on the battery case much
faster<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.130> at<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> end<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.580> day<00:02:35.730> I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
faster so at the end of the day I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.550 
faster so at the end of the day I
