00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 to the produce itself, we need 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 only three ingredients for my recipe 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.800
 I use 350 g of powdered sugar and one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.480
 bit of lemon juice and then you can 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.290
 watching me as I do the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.540
 eggs trainer 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.210
 I just do that so that the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 eggs open and then practically the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.410
 egg baptism on good luck 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.810
 Of course there are other methods 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.199
 But that's just the way I am 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 times most used when the egg yolk 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.120
 is separated is the protein in the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.790
 kitchen machine and will then open 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.390
 before the highest level 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.980
 I add some lemon juice 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.020
 Of course you can also take the protein with you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.210
 make a normal mixa 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.280
 but that takes a bit longer and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 you have to be a bit clunky to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.489
 icing sugar I give the spoon wisely 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.489
 add the protein 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.800
 After about six seven minutes, it saw 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:04.470
 then out of the crowd must be really tight 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 and be not drain to the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.570
 to give a nice shape to the ice mass 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.270
 I will put a fridge here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.390
 use a freezer bag because cut 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 I put in a small hole and give mine 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.600
 strength into it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.100
 the ice will be frozen 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.310
 filled and the whole is then on one 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.509
 baking tray is laid out with baking paper 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.149
 injected in any forms I do 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.830
 So many small pcs that make it handy 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.530
 are and, hopefully, very fancy 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.720
 look and then I do too 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.520
 a few bigger ones then I as 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 tartchen soil will use 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 The whole thing then comes in the oven 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.490
 about 100 to 120 degrees 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.429
 and then that should be at least for 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530
 70 80 minutes in the oven so stay 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.340
 mine were definitely longer than 80 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.590
 minutes in there 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.319
 I have the 80 minutes after the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.459
 exhibited and owned the oven 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.390
 let it cool in the oven 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.060
 however, they are then one to me 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 a little hurt 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.599
 Of course that should not happen on 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.700
 At the end they should still be snow-white 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.950
 but that the color is minimal 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720
 Of course, changing is no problem for 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.370
 the taste we see 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.150
 great for tea or coffee 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.920
 serve 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.360
 I wanted another one here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.909
 Try the variant 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.430
 That's why I have little tartlets out 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.900
 I take some sleep for that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.340
 cream or you can, of course 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 whipping cream 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.629
 and then I had fresh in here 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.849
 akhtar I just made them so small 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.220
 cut and under the blow 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.740
 cream lifting 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 the whole thing is spoonful wise on the 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.480
 Potty soil may still give 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.940
 something decorated so that the whole more beautiful 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.220
 looks and then it can already 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.980
 I have eaten the tarts 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.370
 Mother's Day prepared among others 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.810
 Of course, as a spring as a child 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.550
 I always remember this from my mom 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.920
 owned and she has me 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.600
 then baked and today I wanted her 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.250
 time for my mum button 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.740
 and where we're at with the theme 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.780
 I wish all mommies a nice one 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.730
 Mother's Day and I hope that you 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.320
 video has fallen and that we ourselves 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.980
 at that time next video reunion 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.980
 See you
