 the child answers 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.030

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.390

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.460

 bold skin answers 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 because my daddies are white skinned and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.369
 I do not know about black and when my daddy 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.399
 I will be unhappy 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.670
 want a lot and everything that I ask them 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 they give me so I ask them to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.050
 let's support them to make a 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.959
 blood test investigation for 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.720
 that your daddy knows that you are his and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.590
 that your mom never cheated 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.410
 the bold-skinned boy did not stay very 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.450
 happy to see he had found 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.910
 solution so that he and his 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.870
 mammy 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.530
 later the optimistic child walking by 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.120
 the plane finds another child 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.550
 disappointed and tired of suffering and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.270
 cry and interrogate him what happens to you 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.110
 what are you so afflicted then the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:11.620
 third baby responds is that I do not want 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:15.560
 born but why does the child and the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.010
 reveals at the moment of birth my mommy 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.680
 will die since it will be very difficult to give birth 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.010
 and they will choose between the life of my mommy and 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.580
 mine 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.099
 she will decide for my life and will die 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.470
 a great pain for my daddy and for the 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.819
 despair and the great sorrow of his 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.040
 death he will commit suicide and I will stop 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.549
 to a place where they take children 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.670
 I will not be with my daddies and 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:49.760
 that's why I do not want to do it yet 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.849
 the enthusiastic creature encourages him 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.370
 do not worry, look, when I was born 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.709
 here I will have a lot of money and my 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.079
 Daddies will be so good that I'm going to 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.019
 ask us to help your dad to get out 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:07.040
 go ahead and understand that God took 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.099
 your mom so that they did not suffer gave 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.819
 change to you so that he was not alone 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.910
 and in you see the memory of her you will see 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:20.000
 that your daddy will go ahead and you will 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.310
 love as much as they will believe me 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.370
 mine 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.610
 the afflicted child now waited with 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.620
 you long for his arrival in the world to be able 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.090
 have a friend as special as him 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.130
 when it was time to leave the pilot 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.389
 in charge of sending the children to their 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:46.720
 destiny began to call them the first 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.540
 sent was the boy with bold skin the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.500
 optimistic child yells you do not worry 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.650
 we will never see each other again and remember that 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.530
 I want 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.100
 in the second place the child who left 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.070
 I would be born poor I was so happy because 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.380
 I had hope the promise of the child 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.919
 that when he said goodbye he remembered that 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.969
 I would see on earth that it was no longer 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.069
 sad 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.999
 the third child was the one who would stay 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:22.209
 without the mom her attitude was positive already 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:25.539
 that the enthusiastic child was going to help his 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:27.819
 Daddy to recover soon from the pain and 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.089
 Like others I assure you 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.860
 would be the best friends in the world 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.960
 4 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.080
 after having sent the three 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.340
 children to the world 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.319
 the pilot tried to close the door and 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:49.830
 then the child excited about being born 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:51.569
 shout wait high sir I missed yo yo 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.509
 I also want to go to the world to tell you 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.639
 to my daddies how much I love them and thank 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.680
 to my mind to all the love that will give me 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.350
 when I am born 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.540
 I want you to see that I am as beautiful as 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:10.220
 they wait mister I miss 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.220
 there was a great silence 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:18.500
 and the pilot sentences 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:22.700
 I'm very sorry but today your parents 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.070
 they decided not to have you 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.100
 but but it's just that I had so many 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.440
 illusions of knowing my daddies 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.080
 I also wanted to help my friends because 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.310
 I do not want them to suffer is that I 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.310
 is that I wanted to be born 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:43.589
 the pilot closed the door and expressed how 

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:46.709
 sometimes they can end up with 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:49.860
 illusions of the children when it is the 

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:52.819
 gift that God gives them to complement 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.819
 his life
