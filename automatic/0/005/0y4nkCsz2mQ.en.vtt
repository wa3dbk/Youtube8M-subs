lot<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> these<00:00:27.180> guns<00:00:27.510> might<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.980> zombies<00:00:29.910> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
lot of these guns might be in zombies so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.389 
lot of these guns might be in zombies so
let's<00:00:30.390> start<00:00:30.660> things<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.740> assault

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
let's start things off with the assault

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
let's start things off with the assault
rifles<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.180> black<00:00:33.570> ops<00:00:33.809> Trey<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> first

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
rifles in black ops Trey so the first

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.209 
rifles in black ops Trey so the first
gun<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> called<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.660> man<00:00:37.590> o<00:00:37.860> war

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
gun that we have is called the man o war

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
gun that we have is called the man o war
and<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.730> similar<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.710> cm<00:00:41.700> 901<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:43.200> believe

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and it's similar to the cm 901 I believe

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
and it's similar to the cm 901 I believe
from<00:00:44.219> modern<00:00:44.789> warfare<00:00:45.120> 3<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.110> has<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:47.000> very<00:00:48.000> low

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
from modern warfare 3 it has a very low

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.630 
from modern warfare 3 it has a very low
rate<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.140> fire<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.160> again<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
rate of fire but then again it has a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
rate of fire but then again it has a
really<00:00:50.910> high<00:00:51.030> damage<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.129> very

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
really high damage also it's got very

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.660 
really high damage also it's got very
real<00:00:53.670> recoil<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.920> overall<00:00:55.920> pretty<00:00:56.250> good<00:00:56.370> gun

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
real recoil so overall pretty good gun

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
real recoil so overall pretty good gun

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
we have the arc 7 it has moderate damage

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.570 
we have the arc 7 it has moderate damage
low<00:01:02.219> recoil<00:01:02.570> low<00:01:03.570> rate<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.809> fire<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.309> has

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

using<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> weapon<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.920> looks<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
using this weapon it looks like a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
using this weapon it looks like a
popular<00:01:15.060> weapon<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.720> again<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.530> don't

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
popular weapon but then again we don't

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
popular weapon but then again we don't
know<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.000> in

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
know what it's going to be like in

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
know what it's going to be like in
zombies<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> zombies<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.159> some

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
zombies if it's and zombies because some

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
zombies if it's and zombies because some
of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> most<00:01:20.790> popular<00:01:21.330> weapons<00:01:21.780> from

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
of the most popular weapons from

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
of the most popular weapons from
multiplayer<00:01:22.830> usually<00:01:23.729> aren't<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.630> in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
multiplayer usually aren't very good in

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.539 
multiplayer usually aren't very good in
zombies<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.770> next<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
zombies all right next up we have the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.789 
zombies all right next up we have the
xr2<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.159> only<00:01:30.150> confirmed<00:01:31.079> weapon

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
xr2 which is the only confirmed weapon

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
xr2 which is the only confirmed weapon
in<00:01:32.189> zombies<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.850> least<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
in zombies at least we think it's the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.899 
in zombies at least we think it's the
only<00:01:34.049> confirmed<00:01:34.439> weapon<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> zombies<00:01:35.369> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
only confirmed weapon and zombies this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
only confirmed weapon and zombies this
is<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.479> three-round<00:01:37.049> bursts<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.740> said<00:01:37.979> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
is the three-round bursts like I said in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
is the three-round bursts like I said in
the<00:01:38.310> previous<00:01:39.030> video<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:40.200> would<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the previous video this would be kind of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.020 
the previous video this would be kind of
replacing<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.610> m16<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:42.960> low<00:01:43.259> recoil

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
replacing the m16 it has low recoil

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.630 
replacing the m16 it has low recoil
moderate<00:01:45.030> damage<00:01:45.320> low<00:01:46.320> rate<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> fire<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
moderate damage low rate of fire and it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080 
moderate damage low rate of fire and it
has<00:01:47.880> 30<00:01:48.390> shots<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> clip<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.369> also

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
has 30 shots of the and a clip and also

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
has 30 shots of the and a clip and also
we<00:01:51.329> got<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> Shiva<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.549> semi-automatic

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
we got the Shiva it's a semi-automatic

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.660 
we got the Shiva it's a semi-automatic
so<00:01:53.939> something<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.869> FAL<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.740> has<00:01:56.159> very

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so something like the FAL it has very

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.039 
so something like the FAL it has very
low<00:01:56.939> recoil<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.950> also<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.700> slow<00:02:00.450> rate<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
low recoil and also very slow rate of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.130 
low recoil and also very slow rate of
fire<00:02:01.259> very<00:02:02.250> low<00:02:02.460> rate<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.790> fire<00:02:03.000> even<00:02:03.600> slower

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
fire very low rate of fire even slower

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
fire very low rate of fire even slower
than<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> FAL<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.060> slow

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
than like the FAL so this is really slow

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.389 
than like the FAL so this is really slow
but<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> has<00:02:06.780> high<00:02:07.079> damage<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.250> good

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
but it has high damage and really good

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.119 
but it has high damage and really good
range<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.450> assault<00:02:09.869> rifle<00:02:10.200> only<00:02:10.470> has<00:02:10.679> 20

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
range and this assault rifle only has 20

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.010 
range and this assault rifle only has 20
shots<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.849> clip<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
shots in a clip and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.800 
shots in a clip and
round<00:02:13.320> out<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.860> assault<00:02:14.730> rifles<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
round out the assault rifles we have the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.310 
round out the assault rifles we have the
hv<00:02:16.650> k<00:02:16.920> 30<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.720> moderate<00:02:19.170> damage

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320

fire another 30 shot clip gun and that's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
fire another 30 shot clip gun and that's
all<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.090> salt<00:02:27.390> rifles<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:28.590> so

looks<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.510> MSMC<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.560> looks<00:03:02.460> like<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.820> is

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
looks like the MSMC it looks like it is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.900 
looks like the MSMC it looks like it is
very<00:03:03.600> similar<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.170> MSMC<00:03:04.590> except<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.250> has<00:03:05.490> a

has 20 shots and a clip another one is

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.190 
has 20 shots and a clip another one is
the<00:03:09.740> weevil<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.750> pretty<00:03:13.110> much

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the weevil and this is like pretty much

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.430 
the weevil and this is like pretty much
the<00:03:13.530> p90<00:03:14.190> pretty<00:03:14.490> much<00:03:14.640> exactly<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.480> p90<00:03:16.230> it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the p90 pretty much exactly the p90 it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.220 
the p90 pretty much exactly the p90 it's
got<00:03:16.560> 50<00:03:17.070> shots<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.820> clip<00:03:18.120> moderate<00:03:18.990> recoil

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
got 50 shots in a clip moderate recoil

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.830 
got 50 shots in a clip moderate recoil
moderate<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> fire<00:03:20.580> but<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.300> bad<00:03:21.510> range

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
moderate a fire but really bad range

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.710 
moderate a fire but really bad range
like<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> said<00:03:22.740> exactly<00:03:23.700> like<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.850> p90<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.630> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
like I said exactly like a p90 and the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
like I said exactly like a p90 and the
final<00:03:25.320> SMG<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.250> CUDA<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
final SMG is the CUDA and this is a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.670 
final SMG is the CUDA and this is a
combination<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.770> like<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.970> UMP<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.020> mp5

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
combination of like the UMP and the mp5

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.990 
combination of like the UMP and the mp5
it's<00:03:32.160> got<00:03:32.640> low<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.240> moderate<00:03:34.140> damage<00:03:35.000> moderate

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
it's got low to moderate damage moderate

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.260 
it's got low to moderate damage moderate
rate<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.300> fire<00:03:36.570> very<00:03:37.350> fast<00:03:37.709> reload<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.610> good

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
rate of fire very fast reload and good

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.350 
rate of fire very fast reload and good
range<00:03:39.570> alright<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.140> now<00:03:40.290> I'm<00:03:40.350> going<00:03:40.470> over<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
range alright so now I'm going over the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.630 
range alright so now I'm going over the
shotguns<00:03:42.360> these<00:03:42.630> snipers<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.740> LMGs<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
shotguns these snipers and the LMGs and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.610 
shotguns these snipers and the LMGs and
there<00:03:44.760> really<00:03:45.030> aren't<00:03:45.300> many<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.900> each<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
there really aren't many of each so the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.660 
there really aren't many of each so the
first<00:03:46.950> chakra<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.850> we<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.980> krm<00:03:49.980> 22

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
first chakra that we have is the krm 22

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.720 
first chakra that we have is the krm 22
this<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> pump-action<00:03:52.010> shotgun<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.190> has<00:03:53.400> of

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
this is a pump-action shotgun it has of

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.610 
this is a pump-action shotgun it has of
course<00:03:53.970> slow<00:03:54.660> rate<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.900> fire<00:03:55.020> since<00:03:55.500> its

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
course slow rate of fire since its

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.240 
course slow rate of fire since its
pump-action<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.940> got<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:57.450> range<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.250> it's

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
pump-action it's got good range and it's

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.870 
pump-action it's got good range and it's
very<00:03:59.640> similar<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:01.190> very<00:04:02.190> overpowered

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
very similar to the very overpowered

have the drake
on<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.670> I<00:04:27.540> think<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.440> thing's<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:28.980> be

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
on and I think this thing's going to be

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.850 
on and I think this thing's going to be
annoying<00:04:29.370> it's<00:04:29.730> God<00:04:30.170> semi-auto<00:04:31.170> it's<00:04:31.620> got<00:04:31.830> a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
annoying it's God semi-auto it's got a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.320 
annoying it's God semi-auto it's got a
high<00:04:32.430> rate<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.790> fire<00:04:32.850> with<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:34.280> 20<00:04:35.280> magazine<00:04:36.000> I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
high rate of fire with a 20 magazine I

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.660 
high rate of fire with a 20 magazine I
might<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.750> really<00:04:37.200> good<00:04:37.380> zombies<00:04:38.040> but

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
might be a really good zombies but

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.920 
might be a really good zombies but
multiplier<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.330> think<00:04:39.480> that's<00:04:39.630> going<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.780> be

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
multiplier I think that's going to be

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.810 
multiplier I think that's going to be
annoying<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.380> then<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:40.890> LNG<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.700> they

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
annoying and then the one LNG that they

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.750 
annoying and then the one LNG that they
showed<00:04:42.090> up<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.720> dingo<00:04:43.050> got<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.040> hiring<00:04:44.490> of
