00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.200
 channel followers those on control of my 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 philips hands 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.619
 908 this model with a five-inch screen and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 dogs with eight core processor mediatek 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.920
 Of course I am in this review share your 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 say that they like what is not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 like in this smartphone 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.980
 I note that the screen has control screen 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 glove tucked away far enough in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 There is no settings only if we are a curtain 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.990
 two fingers down 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.700
 take off then we can turn this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.860
 the mode does not argue there is also 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 automatic brightness and general display 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.120
 probably the strongest side of it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 smartphone may be someone wondered how 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 the 8th jordan later we 'll come 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.899
 I personally see the display 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 very worthy of the other side is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.210
 not surprising because when it is removed 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.090
 Review in October early October 2014 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.910
 a smartphone costs about 14 thousand rubles but 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.770
 really even comparing it with more 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.420
 dear flagships i can't say 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.910
 that he is somehow inferior to them 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.670
 the picture is quite juicy enough 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.680
 bright classic fps on the filling 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 characteristics of course as always you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.930
 can look under this video link 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 full there what processor so on and on 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.310
 so then I will tell you what I don’t 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.040
 I like it if we take the test results 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 antutu then everything is in order 30 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.259
 thousand points is a normal result 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.829
 but there is such a test as it is called 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.820
 bonsai witch mark ii know i was very 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.430
 strongly surprised because fps fps 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 it turns out an average of only 20 points in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.600
 second, moreover, the test I did a few 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 times and such a low result for 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 The eight core processor is very 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.399
 amazing only worth mentioning 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.560
 which is very important there is such a parameter as 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.060
 energy saving 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.409
 when we go in here, watch the battery 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.729
 always when you turn it off 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.780
 smartphone tick 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.000
 limit performance 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.159
 cpu it is on 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.810
 keep this in mind by default i'm 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.479
 of course I understand this and when 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.069
 did tests and once styrene by 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.319
 battery head, of course , was 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.599
 disabled despite this result 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.370
 this is exactly how I will launch you a game 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.890
 I will show you a few shots. 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.989
 asphalt 8 i'm a little bigger smartphone 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.019
 tell you my impressions smartphone 5 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.209
 In the street clothes permissions on sensations 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.010
 in hand like most five inch 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.750
 smartphones i mean my 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.269
 checks are convenient enough to note 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.610
 praising philips for the back material 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.260
 the cover is a bit like material 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.599
 samsung galaxy note 3 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.420
 Well, not that it looks like patcon on the skin 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.610
 but that is, they did a good job 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.019
 really nice to stand out but here 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.360
 and there are at least cons 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.239
 apparatus which I hold in my hand housing 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.190
 creaks I do not know whether the party is all 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.200
 or just the sample that I have but 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.030
 I tested it thoroughly I cover 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.190
 even tried to somehow bend a little bit 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.810
 anyway creaking and there is but it is in my 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.650
 instance and i cant claim 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.519
 will you endure your smartphone or not 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.700
 smartphone works with two sim cards 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.160
 there note the sim card usual 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.560
 mini 7 size 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.380
 Of course there is support for memory cards 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.120
 micro sd up to 32 gigabytes and battery 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.170
 battery of sufficiently large capacity 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.450
 3000 milliamps work 5:20 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.190
 without a break as a top and video but 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.750
 Keep in mind the non removable cap 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.709
 removable rechargeable strong few 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.290
 words about photos 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.090
 About the camera 13 megapixel camera 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.519
 of course there is a flash and as many as 5 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.489
 megapixels front for selfie and for 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.859
 skype for example camera quality camera 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.799
 seemed to me rather average to happen 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.720
 Much better video besides writes 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.730
 quite normal full-hd quality 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.709
 as for the screen which i am so 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.730
 really praise me he really 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.800
 like and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.340
 and it feels like I 'll show you 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.860
 picture feels all very even 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.720
 worthy of course viewing angles from all 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.250
 parties will be great this ip screen 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.099
 as far as video playback and 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.709
 dynamics of course this smartphone is good 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.620
 perfect for watching videos amazing 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:24.160
 the speaker is therefore here of good quality 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:27.180
 watch the speaker here alone but he 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.960
 clear enough loud enough 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.320
 even if you put the smartphone then the sound is all 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.320
 still go 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.430
 still pay attention to the buttons usually 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.139
 Now the trend is that the buttons 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.509
 occupy part of the screen here buttons 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.129
 Take exactly the place on the Ali case 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.039
 reasonable backlit in my opinion this 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.750
 Reasonably and conveniently I will note that the version 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.150
 android 4 4 2 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.740
 This is the standard version of android no. 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.360
 processing from philips or 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.129
 third-party is not here but if desired 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.840
 of course you can put any 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.550
 third-party launcher and you will Happiness 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.430
 can turn your android smartphone 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.740
 windows phone can ios can just 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.719
 put some more flexible sound 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.479
 I usually always pay 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.500
 attention sound quality in headphones 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.669
 sound quality seemed to me enough 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.460
 average on my ears it is clear that the rumor has 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.289
 all different but my ears have phones 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.199
 that sound much better exactly 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.849
 then of course I put different checkboxes 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.379
 the best sound here is 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.090
 Of course, use the equalizer 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:40.060
 there is my result somehow enough 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.279
 average well anyway you are not much 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.279
 pay attention to my words by the sound 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.529
 because people are different for someone it 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.460
 just enough and loud enough 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.129
 there is nothing to compare 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.440
 well resume is a smartphone of course i 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.960
 promised you asphalt 8 i run it and 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.080
 Of course I’ll start it because 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.659
 I was very surprised that FPS 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.699
 frames per second only 20 while you 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:07.150
 became honest three times 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.729
 precisely compared with the results 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.259
 antutu which is 30 thousand points clear 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.669
 that the test is not an indicator is impossible 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.770
 completely focus on it 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.690
 that's why I'm launching the game for you 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.789
 so that you can see for yourself 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.789
 all the same 8 jager is no joke 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.389
 night 86 in general I have no reason not 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.190
 trust test Bansal witch mark because 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.750
 what I test is completely different 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.240
 devices and device really 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.509
 powerful they gave out there really 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.699
 since 60 so there is no reason for him 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.900
 believe 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.470
 another issue may be the processor under 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.020
 I somehow don't know him look at my 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.490
 look to play is possible because I 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.550
 so I think that many will 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.840
 buy this particular smartphone sure 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.280
 many will buy it through 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.900
 the fact that he is an eight-core for games 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.050
 so I tell you in detail about this 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.250
 component of the smartphone and telling 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.080
 smartphone impressions in general 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.500
 have enough positive for him 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.139
 he has a quality screen in general 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.880
 not bad autonomy I was afraid that 8 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.220
 cores will eat heavily 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.139
 the battery discharges the battery here 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.000
 enjoyed a few days it seemed 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.800
 what keeps him not quite normal then 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.349
 there is no such thing that by the evening he is already 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.300
 discharged despite 8 cores enough 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:40.130
 nice body is really nice 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.949
 smart phone in your hand everything in general that 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.750
 well but the conclusion to do to you of course 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:45.260
 interesting or not interested in you this 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.240
 smartphone 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.979
 as for my personal rating then 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.570
 of course as usual there are two 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.190
 specifications on our website those on 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.409
 control you can see and rating 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.810
 which I gave to this smartphone and near you 

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:58.159
 see the rating which is folk and the most 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.919
 the main thing you can participate in this 

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.720
 ranking we call you you come on 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.729
 website you write reviews 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.780
 certainly put a rating help 

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:08.289
 to other users 

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.289
 is happy
