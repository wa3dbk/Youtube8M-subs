00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the first thing to realize about this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.130 
the first thing to realize about this
instrument<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.480> player<00:00:48.750> has<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
instrument is that the player has to

instrument is that the player has to
play<00:00:49.470> not<00:00:49.710> only<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:50.280> notes<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.150> in

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
play not only the notes but you're in

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
play not only the notes but you're in
charge<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.780> making<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.350> wind<00:00:52.590> keep<00:00:52.920> ear<00:00:53.130> like

a<00:00:53.370> singer<00:00:53.880> you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.390> sure<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
a singer you have to make sure that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.440 
a singer you have to make sure that
you've<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.170> air<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> pipes<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.180> play

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
you've got air for all the pipes to play

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.400 
you've got air for all the pipes to play
which<00:00:58.140> means<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.700> have<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.330> put<00:01:01.170> air

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
which means that you have to put air

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.630 
which means that you have to put air
into<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.190> system

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
into the system

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.320 
into the system
there<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> feeder<00:01:04.140> valve<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:05.489> feeder<00:01:05.970> which

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there is a feeder valve or feeder which

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 
there is a feeder valve or feeder which
puts<00:01:06.660> air<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.440> regulator<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.160> lives

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
puts air up into a regulator which lives

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.150 
puts air up into a regulator which lives
up<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.729> top<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.300> from<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.410> goes<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
up on top and from there it goes down to

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.790 
up on top and from there it goes down to
the<00:01:11.280> pipes<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> when<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.320> beginning<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
the pipes so when you're beginning to

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.980 
the pipes so when you're beginning to
play<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.180> filled<00:01:15.660> air

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
play you have to first of all filled air

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.440 
play you have to first of all filled air
in<00:01:16.410> you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.830> pump<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.369> six<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in you have to pump about six or so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.380 
in you have to pump about six or so
times<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.710> when<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.220> filled<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.940> there

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
times and when you have filled up there

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.060 
times and when you have filled up there
is<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.869> valve<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> top<00:01:25.440> called<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
is a little valve at the top called a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
is a little valve at the top called a
relief<00:01:26.340> valve<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.210> hear<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
relief valve and you can hear it if you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.950 
relief valve and you can hear it if you
keep<00:01:28.470> pumping<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> air<00:01:29.190> puff<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> air<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
keep pumping in air puff of air and that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.710 
keep pumping in air puff of air and that
keeps<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.410> from<00:01:31.970> over<00:01:32.970> filling<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.450> bellows

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
keeps you from over filling the bellows

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
keeps you from over filling the bellows
and<00:01:33.750> exploding<00:01:34.440> them<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.610> you've

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and exploding them so when you've

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.230 
and exploding them so when you've
reached<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> point<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.790> begin<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
reached that point then you can begin to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.620 
reached that point then you can begin to
play

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.020 

and<00:01:46.630> while<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.740> are<00:01:47.890> paying<00:01:48.160> you<00:01:48.580> have<00:01:48.820> to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
and while you are paying you have to

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.700 
and while you are paying you have to
keep<00:01:49.240> your<00:01:49.480> foot<00:01:49.660> working<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.230> have<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.440> keep

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
keep your foot working you have to keep

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.310 
keep your foot working you have to keep
putting<00:01:50.920> air<00:01:51.280> into<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.820> system<00:01:52.080> but<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.200> are

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
putting air into the system but you are

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.310 
putting air into the system but you are
not<00:01:53.500> keeping<00:01:54.340> time<00:01:54.820> with<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.150> instrument<00:01:55.930> so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
not keeping time with the instrument so

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.690 
not keeping time with the instrument so
in<00:01:56.410> other<00:01:56.500> words<00:01:56.770> if<00:01:57.010> you're<00:01:57.250> only<00:01:57.370> playing

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
in other words if you're only playing

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.490 
in other words if you're only playing
one<00:01:58.000> note<00:01:58.240> at<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.510> time<00:01:58.780> you're<00:01:58.990> using<00:01:59.140> very

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
one note at a time you're using very

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.290 
one note at a time you're using very
little<00:01:59.710> air<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.580> don't<00:02:00.850> need<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.090> pump

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
little air so you don't need to pump

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.120 
little air so you don't need to pump
very<00:02:01.540> fast<00:02:01.930> but<00:02:02.260> if<00:02:02.380> you're<00:02:02.500> playing<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.920> big

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
very fast but if you're playing a big

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.609 
very fast but if you're playing a big
chord

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
chord

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.529 
chord
when<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.310> using<00:02:05.460> more<00:02:05.759> air<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.179> have<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
when you're using more air you have to

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.449 
when you're using more air you have to
realize<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.929> your<00:02:07.439> pumping<00:02:07.979> has<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
realize that your pumping has to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.540 
realize that your pumping has to
increase<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.300> order<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.780> keep<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.440> air<00:02:10.649> supply

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
increase in order to keep the air supply

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.759 
increase in order to keep the air supply
up<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.239> don't<00:02:12.569> keep<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.019> air<00:02:13.140> supply<00:02:13.560> up

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
up if you don't keep the air supply up

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.039 
up if you don't keep the air supply up
what<00:02:14.040> happens<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.780 

it<00:02:21.049> stops<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.709> have<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.280> make<00:02:25.430> sure<00:02:25.609> that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
it stops so you have to make sure that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.119 
it stops so you have to make sure that
you<00:02:25.909> have<00:02:26.090> your<00:02:26.180> reservoir<00:02:26.599> full<00:02:26.959> it's<00:02:27.889> also

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
you have your reservoir full it's also

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.369 
you have your reservoir full it's also
important<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:29.030> pump<00:02:30.249> long<00:02:31.569> even<00:02:32.569> strokes<00:02:32.749> not

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
important to pump long even strokes not

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.339 
important to pump long even strokes not
fast<00:02:34.129> sometimes<00:02:34.939> you<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:35.239> worried<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.170> you

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
fast sometimes you get worried that you

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.349 
fast sometimes you get worried that you
and<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.650> start<00:02:36.920> pumping<00:02:37.189> very<00:02:37.549> fast<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.180> what

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
and you start pumping very fast and what

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.629 
and you start pumping very fast and what
happens<00:02:38.719> is<00:02:41.290> shaking<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.409> whole<00:02:42.590> wind<00:02:43.010> system

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
happens is shaking the whole wind system

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.929 
happens is shaking the whole wind system
but<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.329> pump<00:02:44.599> evenly<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:46.189> can<00:02:46.219> keep<00:02:46.669> the

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
but if you pump evenly you can keep the

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.390 
but if you pump evenly you can keep the
air<00:02:47.090> moving<00:02:47.650> replacing<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.829> air<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.249> you're

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
air moving replacing the air that you're

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.149 
air moving replacing the air that you're
using<00:02:49.840> with<00:02:50.840> new<00:02:51.049> air<00:02:51.310> without<00:02:52.599> causing<00:02:53.599> any

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
using with new air without causing any

in the treble pipe the top octave or so

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.410 
in the treble pipe the top octave or so
those<00:04:55.740> pipes<00:04:56.040> are<00:04:56.340> very<00:04:56.730> easy

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
those pipes are very easy

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.850 
those pipes are very easy
they<00:04:57.810> reflect<00:04:58.910> any<00:04:59.910> variations<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:01.050> pitch<00:05:01.320> the

they reflect any variations in pitch the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.980 
they reflect any variations in pitch the
best<00:05:02.190> way<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.460> tune<00:05:02.790> those<00:05:03.030> would<00:05:03.390> be<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.690> fill

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
best way to tune those would be to fill

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.160 
best way to tune those would be to fill
the<00:05:04.200> reservoir<00:05:04.740> up<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.190> then<00:05:06.060> stop<00:05:06.660> pumping

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
the reservoir up and then stop pumping

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.760 
the reservoir up and then stop pumping
that<00:05:07.500> you're<00:05:07.710> tuning<00:05:08.010> those<00:05:08.280> octaves<00:05:08.880> that

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
that you're tuning those octaves that

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.380 
that you're tuning those octaves that
will<00:05:10.770> give<00:05:10.920> you<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.190> steadiest<00:05:11.610> wind<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.360> that

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
will give you the steadiest wind so that

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.390 
will give you the steadiest wind so that
you'll<00:05:12.630> have<00:05:12.690> about<00:05:12.960> 15<00:05:13.500> seconds<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.160> tune

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
you'll have about 15 seconds to tune

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.870 
you'll have about 15 seconds to tune
then<00:05:14.730> you<00:05:14.820> have<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.060> put<00:05:15.270> air<00:05:15.450> back<00:05:15.690> in<00:05:16.880> this

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
then you have to put air back in this

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.690 
then you have to put air back in this
instrument<00:05:18.450> also<00:05:18.600> has<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.020> ability<00:05:19.080> to
