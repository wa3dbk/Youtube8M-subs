00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.290
 for one is like going to utrecht 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.000
 been there and must also be bought there 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.650
 of course i am friend blood 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.960
 festive 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.490
 rounder and holster and yes that was 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.570
 actually am still others their 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.169
 being at a concert 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.489
 but I hope yes you can now really do something nice 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.920
 good to 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.720
 and yes, so three stores make layers 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.640
 nicer in the bowl and I think that goes 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.160
 start with the source esther 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.380
 this and I think I was always so nice 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.450
 savings far the cursor in the face 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.010
 or anyone but where now is just 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.820
 lied and I like that once too 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.190
 for the variety with my pants me 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.030
 once had a nice phone 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.580
 required 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.580
 and then I had this consequence this is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.750
 it's pretty sweet and it's one 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.829
 super skinny and actually wanted the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.740
 skinny 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.780
 only yes where we are not really so kings or 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.799
 heavy on a large weapon that could not on 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.570
 enter 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.079
 so then that i have taken a super skin 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.899
 but this really besson fine and yes this is 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.640
 so I did have paper and this through 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.210
 now also my favorite books 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.149
 skipper now two and read what 59 euros 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.340
 and yes for us it is not very expensive 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.960
 and yes this is of course not the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.450
 cheapest book you ever exist 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.280
 of course but yes I really just had 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.139
 once a nice good source code 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.549
 from until the me really already half year 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:38.770
 no longer linked from 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.829
 further on this block of slippers bought this one 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.959
 and I don't run that size anyway me 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.319
 right in the shoe 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:51.999
 and then I came across a narrow and normal 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:55.719
 of 3738 and how far are basically all about 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:59.979
 just 768 on this one 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:02.859
 and pointed to 17 euros and yes normal know 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.320
 you i think quality is something of it 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.800
 10 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.530
 euros and from that ariana siblings 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.820
 but the prices on between that so me 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.980
 thought you know i'm gonna you 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.230
 try it on the soles of the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.910
 slippers all monster labs and 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.770
 Designing pass 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.110
 I also bought a cookie for 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.870
 shorts and be that one 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.910
 sale and the was very much just it 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.950
 was all m or l 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.020
 And I couldn't really care less about it 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.090
 just still quite expensive and far 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.900
 that it is this feeling the race was before 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.120
 24 to 12 euros go and yes i think 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.940

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.170
