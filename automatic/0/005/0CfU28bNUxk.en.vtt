you<00:02:48.780> how<00:02:49.349> do<00:02:49.410> we<00:02:49.590> how<00:02:50.099> do<00:02:50.160> we<00:02:50.280> euthanize<00:02:50.700> our

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
you how do we how do we euthanize our

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.720 
you how do we how do we euthanize our
for<00:02:52.050> all<00:02:52.230> our<00:02:52.410> frozen<00:02:52.650> feeders<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.280> same<00:02:53.519> way

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
for all our frozen feeders the same way

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.509 
for all our frozen feeders the same way
we<00:02:54.030> use<00:02:54.209> co2<00:02:54.510> gas<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.800> reason<00:02:56.160> why<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.489> use

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
we use co2 gas and the reason why we use

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.420 
we use co2 gas and the reason why we use
co2<00:02:57.120> gas<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.620> absolute

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
co2 gas is because it is the absolute

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.820 
co2 gas is because it is the absolute
most<00:03:00.000> humane<00:03:00.569> way<00:03:00.629> to<00:03:01.319> euthanize<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.780> prey<00:03:03.780> item

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
most humane way to euthanize a prey item

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.040 
most humane way to euthanize a prey item
like<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:05.239> rat<00:03:06.239> or<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.989> mouse<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:09.150> certainly<00:03:09.540> don't

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
like a rat or a mouse we certainly don't

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.000 
like a rat or a mouse we certainly don't
want<00:03:11.180> rats<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.510> mice<00:03:12.540> or<00:03:12.989> any<00:03:13.230> living<00:03:13.530> thing<00:03:13.650> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
want rats or mice or any living thing to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.410 
want rats or mice or any living thing to
suffer<00:03:14.400> more<00:03:14.610> than<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:15.000> has<00:03:15.120> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
suffer more than it has to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.990 
suffer more than it has to
and<00:03:15.629> in<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.170> case<00:03:16.409> co2<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.340> really<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and in this case co2 is really a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.960 
and in this case co2 is really a
painless<00:03:18.480> way<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.170> euthanize<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.730> that's

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
painless way to euthanize and so that's

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.570 
painless way to euthanize and so that's
the<00:03:21.150> only<00:03:21.180> way<00:03:21.690> we<00:03:22.110> will<00:03:22.290> euthanize<00:03:22.769> here<00:03:23.069> we

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
the only way we will euthanize here we

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.390 
the only way we will euthanize here we
feed<00:03:23.790> all<00:03:24.030> our<00:03:24.060> reptiles
