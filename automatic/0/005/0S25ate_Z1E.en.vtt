00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
going to be difficult or it's just going

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.030 
going to be difficult or it's just going
to<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.239> any<00:03:06.510> like<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:07.230> any<00:03:07.379> other<00:03:07.590> DLC<00:03:08.010> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
to be any like like any other DLC and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.619 
to be any like like any other DLC and
then<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> couple<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.700> days<00:03:08.790> we'd<00:03:09.060> do<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.359> really

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
then a couple of days we'd do it really

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.179 
then a couple of days we'd do it really
easily<00:03:09.840> I'm<00:03:10.079> hoping<00:03:10.349> it's<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.980> I

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
easily I'm hoping it's not like that I

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.830 
easily I'm hoping it's not like that I
want<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:11.730> deal<00:03:11.939> seem<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.389> be<00:03:12.480> as<00:03:12.599> difficult

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
want this deal seem to be as difficult

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.809 
want this deal seem to be as difficult
as<00:03:13.170> possible<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.099> point<00:03:14.430> where<00:03:14.639> we

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
as possible to the point where we

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.910 
as possible to the point where we
actually<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.750> really<00:03:16.200> try<00:03:16.439> and<00:03:16.709> do

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
actually have to really try and do

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770 
actually have to really try and do
really<00:03:17.189> good<00:03:17.459> teamwork<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.150> actually<00:03:18.480> take

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
really good teamwork to actually take

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.569

ship in the background there I just

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.860 
ship in the background there I just
think<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.280> looks<00:03:53.519> insane<00:03:53.849> but<00:03:54.000> anyway<00:03:54.299> enough

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
think it looks insane but anyway enough

think it looks insane but anyway enough

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
the first to face them so I'm guessing

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.259 
the first to face them so I'm guessing
what<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.459> means<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.880> pretty<00:04:18.120> much<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
what this means is pretty much the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.879 
what this means is pretty much the
Dreadnought<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.959> going<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.229> play<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.590> big<00:04:19.859> part

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
Dreadnought is going to play a big part

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.159 
Dreadnought is going to play a big part

in the taken King dlc for destiny and

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.529 
in the taken King dlc for destiny and
I'm<00:04:22.560> guessing<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.279> its<00:04:23.610> most<00:04:23.849> likely<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.330> true

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
I'm guessing and its most likely is true

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.149 
I'm guessing and its most likely is true
that<00:04:24.659> we're<00:04:24.810> going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.960> be<00:04:25.080> facing<00:04:25.320> need<00:04:25.710> taken
