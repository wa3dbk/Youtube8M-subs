because those that did win would have

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
because those that did win would have
been<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.120> upset<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.079> those<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> if

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
been kind of upset so or those that if

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.139 
been kind of upset so or those that if
they<00:00:59.129> would<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.370> won<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.059> have

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
they would have won and they would have

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
they would have won and they would have
saw<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.199> been<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
saw that then it would have been kind of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.410 
saw that then it would have been kind of
ugly<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.160> regardless<00:01:02.760> i<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.149> want<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> say
