event ahold of Jack the homework for the
fastest<00:01:07.890> Phyllida<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.369> don't<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.580> secure<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
fastest Phyllida so don't we secure this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500 
fastest Phyllida so don't we secure this
we<00:01:09.960> need<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.830> using<00:01:11.490> research<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.240> making

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
we need that using research for making

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.120 
we need that using research for making
better<00:01:12.720> animal<00:01:13.200> welfare<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> time

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
better animal welfare all the time

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700 
better animal welfare all the time
that's<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.869> concurring<00:01:15.869> process<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.500> will

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that's a concurring process which will

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.880 
that's a concurring process which will
never<00:01:16.950> end<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.259> say<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
never end but I think we can say that in

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
never end but I think we can say that in
the<00:01:20.009> performing<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.729> Europe<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.540> very<00:01:22.050> far

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the performing in Europe we are very far

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.280 
the performing in Europe we are very far
on<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.830> issue<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.270> wasn't<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> didn't

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
on this issue it wasn't one a didn't

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
on this issue it wasn't one a didn't
