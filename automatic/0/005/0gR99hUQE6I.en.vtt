let's try the other side because I know

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
let's try the other side because I know
for<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> fact<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.820> does<00:00:53.969> change<00:00:54.239> locations

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
for a fact it does change locations

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
for a fact it does change locations
based<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.660> it's

based on I don't know I think it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.209 
based on I don't know I think it's
random<00:00:57.960> locations<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> same

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
random locations but it's in the same

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.690 
random locations but it's in the same
area<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:03.719> should<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.379> Oh<00:01:04.700> or

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
closest one to me right now is the the

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.460 
closest one to me right now is the the
oval<00:03:21.000> shape<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.480> know<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> silo<00:03:22.290> type

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
oval shape you know like the silo type

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.080 
oval shape you know like the silo type
thing<00:03:22.680> but<00:03:22.829> it's<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.070> half<00:03:23.310> assert<00:03:23.670> half<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
thing but it's like half assert half and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.770 
thing but it's like half assert half and
half<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.480> half<00:03:25.320> an<00:03:25.470> oval<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.480> we're<00:03:27.480> gonna<00:03:27.630> try

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
half a half an oval so we're gonna try

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.520 
half a half an oval so we're gonna try
that<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:29.329> think<00:03:30.329> that's<00:03:30.420> what's<00:03:30.660> close<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.140> can't

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.830 
that I think that's what's close I can't

room was a giant circle like this this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.620 
room was a giant circle like this this
map<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.400> giant<00:04:15.700> circle<00:04:16.030> it's<00:04:16.150> not<00:04:16.270> actually

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
map is a giant circle it's not actually

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.820 
map is a giant circle it's not actually
squared<00:04:16.959> or<00:04:17.080> anything<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.680> really

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830

squared or anything so if you really
follow<00:04:18.100> up<00:04:18.310> happens<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.970> circle<00:04:19.270> and<00:04:19.330> you

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
follow up happens the circle and you

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.060 
follow up happens the circle and you
know<00:04:19.510> where<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.720> landmarks<00:04:20.140> are<00:04:20.320> should<00:04:20.980> be

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
know where the landmarks are should be

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.830

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.480 
not even funny
a<00:06:24.479> good<00:06:25.050> feeling<00:06:25.499> tickling<00:06:25.919> my<00:06:26.069> ass<00:06:26.219> right

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
a good feeling tickling my ass right

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.820 
a good feeling tickling my ass right
okay<00:06:29.490> where<00:06:30.210> the<00:06:30.300> hell<00:06:30.330> were<00:06:31.169> the<00:06:31.319> rocks

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
okay where the hell were the rocks

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.230 
okay where the hell were the rocks
I<00:06:31.860> think<00:06:32.129> the<00:06:32.189> rocks<00:06:32.400> are<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.639> next<00:06:32.819> closest

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
I think the rocks are the next closest

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.490 
I think the rocks are the next closest
thing

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.900 

or<00:06:41.500> not<00:06:41.680> I<00:06:41.890> thought<00:06:42.070> it<00:06:42.160> was<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.340> rocks<00:06:42.580> but<00:06:42.880> I

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
or not I thought it was the rocks but I

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.670 
or not I thought it was the rocks but I
guess<00:06:43.060> it's<00:06:43.210> a<00:06:43.270> silo<00:06:43.660> I<00:06:43.690> guess<00:06:43.930> I<00:06:44.050> lucked<00:06:44.200> out

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
guess it's a silo I guess I lucked out

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.970 
guess it's a silo I guess I lucked out
sometimes<00:06:45.640> there<00:06:45.790> on<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.030> rocks<00:06:46.240> but<00:06:46.980> maybe

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
sometimes there on the rocks but maybe

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.190 
sometimes there on the rocks but maybe
there<00:06:48.130> on<00:06:48.190> the<00:06:48.280> silo<00:06:48.870> is<00:06:49.870> on<00:06:50.050> the<00:06:50.140> silo

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
there on the silo is on the silo

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.170
