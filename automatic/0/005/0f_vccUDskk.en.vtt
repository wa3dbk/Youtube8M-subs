stable<00:01:49.149> price<00:01:49.359> at<00:01:49.569> this<00:01:49.749> point<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.200> time<00:01:50.639> the

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639 
stable price at this point in time the

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.889 
stable price at this point in time the
reason<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.799> reason<00:01:53.979> they're<00:01:54.369> kind<00:01:54.579> of<00:01:54.899> doing

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
reason the reason they're kind of doing

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.899 
reason the reason they're kind of doing
a<00:01:56.020> step-by-step<00:01:56.499> rather<00:01:57.159> than<00:01:57.340> all<00:01:57.549> at<00:01:57.579> once

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
a step-by-step rather than all at once

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.870 
a step-by-step rather than all at once
and<00:01:58.090> removing<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.569> floor<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.079> because<00:01:59.979> they

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and removing the floor is because they

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.659 
and removing the floor is because they
want<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.239> try<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.840> stop<00:02:02.259> this<00:02:02.499> inflation<00:02:03.130> so

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:03.669 
want to try to stop this inflation so

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:06.059 
want to try to stop this inflation so
you<00:02:04.179> know<00:02:04.270> when<00:02:04.419> they<00:02:04.509> made<00:02:04.689> diablo<00:02:05.409> 3<00:02:05.679> it<00:02:05.889> just

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
you know when they made diablo 3 it just

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.949 
you know when they made diablo 3 it just
kind<00:02:06.279> of<00:02:06.340> got<00:02:06.789> set<00:02:07.179> up<00:02:07.209> with<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.419> system<00:02:07.840> it's

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
kind of got set up with the system it's

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.350 
kind of got set up with the system it's
like<00:02:08.110> yeah<00:02:08.349> that'll<00:02:08.800> probably<00:02:09.069> work<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:10.209> then

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
like yeah that'll probably work and then

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.940 
like yeah that'll probably work and then
it<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.929> know<00:02:11.020> didn't<00:02:11.380> really<00:02:11.590> end<00:02:11.680> up<00:02:11.770> working

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
it you know didn't really end up working

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.950 
it you know didn't really end up working
that<00:02:12.280> well<00:02:12.430> largely<00:02:13.210> because<00:02:13.660> there

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
that well largely because there

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.950 
that well largely because there
model<00:02:14.290> didn't<00:02:15.220> include<00:02:15.520> their<00:02:16.420> predictions

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
model didn't include their predictions

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.630 
model didn't include their predictions
about<00:02:17.110> how<00:02:17.230> many<00:02:17.560> bots<00:02:17.830> will<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.250> playing<00:02:18.490> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
about how many bots will be playing the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.090 
about how many bots will be playing the
game<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:19.000> my<00:02:19.510> opinion<00:02:19.540> at<00:02:19.930> least<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.350> two<00:02:20.800> and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
game in my opinion at least and two and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
game in my opinion at least and two and
i<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:22.330> he<00:02:22.450> anticipated<00:02:22.990> more<00:02:23.260> people<00:02:23.500> who

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
i think he anticipated more people who

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.440 
i think he anticipated more people who
continue<00:02:23.860> playing<00:02:24.250> i'll<00:02:24.700> explain<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.330> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
continue playing i'll explain that in a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.030 
continue playing i'll explain that in a
second<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.260> what<00:02:26.440> they're<00:02:26.560> doing<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.980> they're

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
second so what they're doing is they're

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.790 
second so what they're doing is they're
trying<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.670> artificially<00:02:28.510> stall<00:02:29.020> inflation

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
trying to artificially stall inflation

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.400 
trying to artificially stall inflation
by<00:02:30.070> lowering<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.760> cap<00:02:31.120> again<00:02:31.330> again<00:02:31.960> which<00:02:32.200> is

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
by lowering the cap again again which is

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
by lowering the cap again again which is
pretty<00:02:32.770> much<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.430> final<00:02:33.820> strategy

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
pretty much like the final strategy

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.090 
pretty much like the final strategy
their<00:02:34.540> final<00:02:35.050> car<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.890> play

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
their final car that they have to play

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.520 
their final car that they have to play
so<00:02:36.700> that's<00:02:36.850> what's<00:02:37.090> been<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.960> you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
so that's what's been going on and you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.310 
so that's what's been going on and you
know<00:02:38.680> don't<00:02:38.980> be<00:02:39.070> surprised<00:02:39.520> when<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:41.080> know<00:02:41.200> it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
know don't be surprised when you know it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.810 
know don't be surprised when you know it
falls<00:02:41.590> another<00:02:41.920> level<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.400> they<00:02:42.490> have<00:02:42.640> to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
falls another level and they have to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.000 
falls another level and they have to
drop<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.480> floor<00:02:43.720> again<00:02:44.020> but<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.890> know

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
drop the floor again but you know

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.800 
drop the floor again but you know
that'll<00:02:45.460> probably<00:02:45.490> happen<00:02:45.970> when<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> third

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that'll probably happen when the third

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.630 
that'll probably happen when the third
party<00:02:47.170> websites<00:02:47.590> start<00:02:47.920> selling<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> gold

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
party websites start selling the gold

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.240 
party websites start selling the gold
under<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.630> new<00:02:49.810> floor<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.680> quite<00:02:50.980> some<00:02:51.220> time

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
under the new floor for quite some time

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.250 
under the new floor for quite some time
and<00:02:51.490> then<00:02:51.700> they'll<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.540> drop<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.990> again

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
and then they'll you know drop it again

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.760 
and then they'll you know drop it again
so<00:02:53.590> some<00:02:53.830> typical<00:02:54.070> ship<00:02:54.490> there<00:02:54.730> but<00:02:55.770> pretty

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
so some typical ship there but pretty

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.470 
so some typical ship there but pretty
much<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.460> reason<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.150> all<00:02:58.300> happening

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
much the reason this is all happening

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.930 
much the reason this is all happening
and<00:02:58.930> what's<00:02:59.470> making<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.610> interesting

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
and what's making it really interesting

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.090 
and what's making it really interesting
at<00:03:01.360> least<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.810> me<00:03:01.930> from<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.380> know<00:03:02.500> an<00:03:02.620> outside

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
at least for me from you know an outside

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.030 
at least for me from you know an outside
perspective<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.150> game<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.440> know

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
perspective of the game is that you know

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.450 
perspective of the game is that you know
when<00:03:06.340> when<00:03:07.120> someone<00:03:07.360> quits<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.780> game<00:03:08.460> because

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
when when someone quits the game because

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.550 
when when someone quits the game because
they<00:03:09.640> know<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.630> gold<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.050> going<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.380> lose

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
they know that the gold is going to lose

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.380 
they know that the gold is going to lose
value<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.130> they're<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.760> play<00:03:12.940> again<00:03:13.270> at

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
value if they're going to play again at

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.510 
value if they're going to play again at
a<00:03:13.420> later<00:03:13.510> point<00:03:14.050> in<00:03:14.230> time<00:03:14.290> they're<00:03:15.130> pretty

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
a later point in time they're pretty

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.570 
a later point in time they're pretty
much<00:03:15.640> forced<00:03:16.330> into<00:03:16.870> selling<00:03:17.260> their<00:03:17.470> goal<00:03:17.710> so<00:03:18.340> I

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
much forced into selling their goal so I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.950 
much forced into selling their goal so I
didn't<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.120> when<00:03:19.300> I<00:03:19.360> stopped<00:03:19.660> playing

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
didn't do this when I stopped playing

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.680 
didn't do this when I stopped playing
diablo<00:03:20.260> 3<00:03:21.190> i<00:03:21.310> stopped<00:03:21.700> playing<00:03:21.730> diablo<00:03:22.120> 3<00:03:22.510> like

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
diablo 3 i stopped playing diablo 3 like

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.710 
diablo 3 i stopped playing diablo 3 like
100<00:03:23.110> million<00:03:23.380> gold<00:03:23.620> which<00:03:24.160> i<00:03:24.760> think<00:03:25.330> at<00:03:25.630> the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
100 million gold which i think at the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.350 
100 million gold which i think at the
time<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.080> actually<00:03:26.230> 250<00:03:27.130> bucks<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.610> these

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
time is actually 250 bucks and these

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.900 
time is actually 250 bucks and these
days<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.840> hundred<00:03:29.770> million<00:03:29.950> gold<00:03:30.250> i<00:03:30.430> believe<00:03:30.730> is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
days a hundred million gold i believe is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.950 
days a hundred million gold i believe is
like<00:03:31.440> three<00:03:32.440> bucks<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.880> know<00:03:34.090> pretty<00:03:34.690> big

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
like three bucks so you know pretty big

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.470 
like three bucks so you know pretty big
difference<00:03:35.350> there<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.270> people

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
difference there and you know people

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420 
difference there and you know people
realize<00:03:38.050> this<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.470> people<00:03:38.620> who<00:03:38.920> quit<00:03:39.190> if

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
realize this and people who quit if

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.550 
realize this and people who quit if
they're<00:03:39.970> smart<00:03:40.240> enough<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.750> i<00:03:41.140> would<00:03:41.410> suspect

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
they're smart enough and i would suspect

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.730 
they're smart enough and i would suspect
a<00:03:42.330> large<00:03:43.330> portion<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.810> them<00:03:43.960> probably<00:03:44.200> aren't

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
a large portion of them probably aren't

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.550 
a large portion of them probably aren't
because<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:46.330> play<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.810> options<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:47.290> quite

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
because the play the options for quite

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.320 
because the play the options for quite
some<00:03:47.740> time<00:03:47.770> they're<00:03:48.190> still<00:03:48.400> playing<00:03:48.490> diablo<00:03:49.060> 3

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
some time they're still playing diablo 3

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.570 
some time they're still playing diablo 3
they're<00:03:50.200> gonna<00:03:50.380> sell<00:03:50.620> their<00:03:50.770> gold<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.100> what

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
they're gonna sell their gold and what

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.150 
they're gonna sell their gold and what
this<00:03:51.760> creates<00:03:52.210> is<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.690> high<00:03:53.230> supply<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.920> gold

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160

already you know filling supply that's
given<00:03:59.740> by<00:03:59.950> bots<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.510> diablo<00:04:01.900> 3<00:04:02.110> has<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.290> lot<00:04:02.440> of

costs and all that stuff pretty much

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.750 
costs and all that stuff pretty much
that's<00:04:18.910> all<00:04:19.410> closely<00:04:20.410> trumped<00:04:21.070> by<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.280> number

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
that's all closely trumped by the number

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.400 
that's all closely trumped by the number
of<00:04:21.790> box<00:04:22.090> out<00:04:22.330> there<00:04:22.540> who<00:04:22.720> are<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:22.840> picking<00:04:23.260> up

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
of box out there who are just picking up

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.730 
of box out there who are just picking up
the<00:04:23.560> gold<00:04:23.770> off<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.100> ground

the gold off the ground

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.909 
the gold off the ground
and<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:26.030> know<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.560> pretty<00:04:27.560> close<00:04:27.860> to

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
and you know this is pretty close to

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.860 
and you know this is pretty close to
edit<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.370> because<00:04:28.759> the<00:04:29.000> gold<00:04:29.449> price<00:04:29.599> has<00:04:29.840> been

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
edit it because the gold price has been

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.870 
edit it because the gold price has been
stable<00:04:30.500> from<00:04:30.650> what<00:04:30.800> I've<00:04:30.919> been<00:04:30.949> told<00:04:31.130> for<00:04:31.580> you

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
stable from what I've been told for you

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.240 
stable from what I've been told for you
know<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.150> little<00:04:32.419> bit<00:04:32.539> of<00:04:32.750> time<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.069> but<00:04:34.069> you

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
know a little bit of time now but you

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.770 
know a little bit of time now but you
know<00:04:34.370> when<00:04:34.490> people<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:35.090> know<00:04:35.180> leave<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.569> game

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
know when people you know leave the game

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.070 
know when people you know leave the game
it<00:04:36.020> does<00:04:36.410> sometimes<00:04:37.000> introduce<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.180> very<00:04:38.720> large

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
it does sometimes introduce a very large

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.010 
it does sometimes introduce a very large
quantity<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.770> gold<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.310> as<00:04:40.819> a<00:04:40.849> result<00:04:41.180> supply

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
quantity of gold and as a result supply

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.189 
quantity of gold and as a result supply
goes<00:04:42.289> up<00:04:42.560> demand<00:04:43.569> honestly<00:04:44.569> goes<00:04:44.810> down

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
goes up demand honestly goes down

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.990 
goes up demand honestly goes down
because<00:04:45.470> if<00:04:45.860> someone<00:04:46.220> stops<00:04:46.490> playing<00:04:46.819> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
because if someone stops playing the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.460 
because if someone stops playing the
game<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.419> know<00:04:47.539> they're<00:04:47.780> not<00:04:47.930> going<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.199> look

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
game you know they're not going to look

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.080 
game you know they're not going to look
at<00:04:48.620> buying<00:04:48.860> gold<00:04:49.160> anymore<00:04:49.460> they're<00:04:49.880> just

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
at buying gold anymore they're just

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.080 
at buying gold anymore they're just
selling<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.830> man<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.250> drops<00:04:52.550> supply

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
selling it so the man the drops supply

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.450 
selling it so the man the drops supply
increases<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:54.199> price<00:04:54.470> drops<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.220> that's

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
increases the price drops and that's

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.270 
increases the price drops and that's
pretty<00:04:55.699> much<00:04:55.819> what's<00:04:56.150> going<00:04:56.479> on<00:04:56.599> there<00:04:56.870> and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
pretty much what's going on there and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.830 
pretty much what's going on there and
it's<00:04:58.280> really<00:04:58.520> going<00:04:58.789> to<00:04:58.880> take<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.180> big<00:04:59.479> event

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
it's really going to take a big event

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.770 
it's really going to take a big event
for<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.470> price<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.889> go<00:05:01.039> back<00:05:01.340> up<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:01.819> I<00:05:02.720> think

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
for the price to go back up and I think

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.930 
for the price to go back up and I think
what<00:05:03.770> they're<00:05:03.919> trying<00:05:04.159> to<00:05:04.280> do<00:05:04.460> here<00:05:04.699> is<00:05:04.789> there

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
what they're trying to do here is there

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.850 
what they're trying to do here is there
try<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.150> maybe<00:05:05.419> put<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:05.810> this<00:05:06.020> floor<00:05:06.349> maybe<00:05:06.560> put

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
try to maybe put in this floor maybe put

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.999 
try to maybe put in this floor maybe put
another<00:05:07.159> floor<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:08.169> maybe<00:05:09.169> we'll<00:05:09.560> see<00:05:09.770> some

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
another floor and maybe we'll see some

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.640 
another floor and maybe we'll see some
expansion<00:05:10.400> action<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.060> diablo<00:05:11.509> 3<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:11.990> i<00:05:12.470> think

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
expansion action in diablo 3 and i think

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.610 
expansion action in diablo 3 and i think
when<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:12.830> happens<00:05:13.310> because<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:14.349> demand<00:05:15.349> is

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
when that happens because the demand is

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.600 
when that happens because the demand is
going<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.099> absolutely<00:05:16.690> you<00:05:17.690> know<00:05:17.810> sky-rocket

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
going to absolutely you know sky-rocket

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.790 
going to absolutely you know sky-rocket
then<00:05:19.610> we're<00:05:19.819> gonna<00:05:19.970> see<00:05:20.270> some<00:05:20.409> you<00:05:21.409> know<00:05:21.470> some

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
then we're gonna see some you know some

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.770 
then we're gonna see some you know some
things<00:05:22.220> turn<00:05:22.550> around<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:23.090> maybe<00:05:23.240> then<00:05:23.509> we'll

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
things turn around and maybe then we'll

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.689 
things turn around and maybe then we'll
talk<00:05:24.349> about<00:05:24.409> that<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:24.979> have<00:05:25.220> some<00:05:25.400> more<00:05:25.520> fun

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
talk about that and have some more fun
