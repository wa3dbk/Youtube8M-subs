00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.550
 of apple we are going to make with pasta 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.200
 puff pastry cream in which 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.850
 I will leave the links in the part of 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.559
 down to go see how they are made 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.270
 these recipes and they can also use 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.010

 and for the next dessert video they 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.059
 I have a while I'm going to request that

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.149
 most special desserts there are of the 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.309
 more colorful and luxurious inclusive but 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.589
 pretty simple to make the fondant of 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.629
 chocolate remember with 200 likes in 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.870
 It seems that's all I have left but 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.450
 tell them to give him little hand network this 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.150
 next champions 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.000
 The first thing we need to do is make 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.340
 I'm going to make a syrup with half 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
 cup of water and three large spoons 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.360
 filled with sugar 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.220
 let's show how and very well up 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.810
 that dissolves completely in our 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.729
 city 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 understanding about whether we are going to 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.240
 start to serve them apple I'm going to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.210
 use approximately 200 grams of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.490
 more puff to make them in the box 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.799
 the description I leave you how to prepare 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.929
 this missing puff or you can buy it 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.720
 in some supermarkets what I'm going to 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.130
 to basically do is give it a form 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 rectangular to navigate 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.840
 we have flour only the one that is being 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.479
 required 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.030
 the thickness will be approximately 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.820
 size of my apple I'm going to put in 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.460
 this part my apples observe 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.590
 a small tab as we will see has 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.129
 come out pretty long 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 with two doors and this is 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.250
 note the thickness is really thin 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.129
 it's calderete grass it's fine I'm going to 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.140
 square I'm going to try to match what 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.940
 more possible and for now it will be 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.130
 a base 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.330
 But if we need others, let's do 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.210
 more to make a solution and 40 what 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.880
 what I will do will be simply and crushing 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.420
 with an approximate thickness of 1 to 2 fingers 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.420
 to the fullest 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.900
 and here we have our strip with this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.970
 let's do our shores is the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.610
 long of my skin and more or less like that 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.610
 I will leave my shores long we are going to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.430
 and now I will decide to it 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.489
 we have our base and our 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.769
 shores let's start to put together what 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.000
 I'm going to do is explain a bit all my 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.000
 base with the help of a fork 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.400
 I'm going to stick my edges I seem to use 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.410
 my face once it gets on is just a 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.410
 little on both sides 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.190
 and now I will put my knees 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:51.110
 little long does not matter the likes 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.450
 little very gently just for you 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.450
 now if we have the base of our river 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.700
 at the bottom I leave the links 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.080
 to make two types of custard 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.410
 having the excess we are going to use 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.360
 pastry cream and I'll be putting a 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.360
 little custard in all 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.330
 the apples these can be from 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.080
 any kind of red green apple 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.080
 gala 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.510
 I'm going to go to the middle of my center and 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.260
 carefully trying to leave the form 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.200
 of my apple so is the same list 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.040
 with which we are going to cut they have 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.700
 not very thick or medium slices of 1 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.890
 to 2 millimeters thick, they exceed 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.870
 dates of the apple but that's how it came out in 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.849
 this time and now I'm going to put 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.199
 my apple program 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.199
 the apples of the same tone 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.620
 for this risk use an apple and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.200
 average was bar to have the size and 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.050
 the thickness of its stain we will varnish 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:20.660
 all our shore 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.730
 this is going to make it grow more even and 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.550
 will help the apple with improving its 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.220
 taste and that we are not sexis can 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.100
 add also a few drops of lemon in 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.080
 every moment the preferable thing is that terry 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.420
 they are preparing it already in their tray of 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.800
 oven to not move or manipulate 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.570
 I did it in a plastic so that it goes 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.080
 better in the video we have a bit of 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.270
 flour where we have to have 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.790
 prepared in our oven tray or 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.640
 where we go to bake we have our 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.830
 humphrey heated to 200 degrees during 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.510
 a minimum of 20 minutes let's put 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.640
 we're going to let him cook for a 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.070
 minimum of 20 minutes and there we go to 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.139
 checking if it is golden brown and cooked the 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.169
 I left pasta 25 minutes 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.879
 him and observe here is one more than 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.069
 good look 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.199
 two beautiful let's terrible 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.210
 let it cool a little bit and right now 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:18.960
 we are going to finish and to make about their 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:22.650
 habits and when serving I'm going to 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.770
