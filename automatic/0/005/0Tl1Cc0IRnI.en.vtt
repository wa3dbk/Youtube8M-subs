hey folks Quilly came here what you're

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.500 
hey folks Quilly came here what you're
about<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> see<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> complete<00:00:02.730> tutorial<00:00:03.389> on

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
about to see is a complete tutorial on

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.170 
about to see is a complete tutorial on
how<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.840> make<00:00:04.170> this<00:00:04.440> game<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:04.890> unity<00:00:05.310> 3d<00:00:05.879> this

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
how to make this game in unity 3d this

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.120 
how to make this game in unity 3d this
is<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.330> full<00:00:06.600> 3d<00:00:06.990> game<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.470> just<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:07.680> happens<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
is a full 3d game it just so happens the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.730 
is a full 3d game it just so happens the
camera<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.580> facing<00:00:08.849> directly<00:00:09.780> forward<00:00:10.380> into

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
camera is facing directly forward into

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.680 
camera is facing directly forward into
the<00:00:10.830> object<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.340> looks<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.700> 2d<00:00:12.240> objects

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the object so it looks like 2d objects

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.180 
the object so it looks like 2d objects
but<00:00:13.110> everything<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.980> here<00:00:14.009> is

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
but everything you see in here is

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.919 
but everything you see in here is
actually<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> complete<00:00:14.940> 3d<00:00:15.240> object<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.870> is

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
actually a complete 3d object it is

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
actually a complete 3d object it is
using<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> complete<00:00:16.800> built-in<00:00:17.279> physics

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
using the complete built-in physics

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.970 
using the complete built-in physics
system<00:00:18.270> Oh<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.109> ball<00:00:19.289> oh<00:00:19.500> god<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
system Oh get that ball oh god this is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.240 
system Oh get that ball oh god this is
gonna<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.220> tough<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.949> handle<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
gonna get tough at to handle all the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550 
gonna get tough at to handle all the
collisions<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:24.359> occasion<00:00:24.810> when<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> bricks

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
collisions on occasion when the bricks

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.500 
collisions on occasion when the bricks
are<00:00:25.769> destroyed<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.640> drop<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.240> sort<00:00:27.480> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
are destroyed they do drop these sort of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.660 
are destroyed they do drop these sort of
powerup<00:00:27.930> things<00:00:28.170> which<00:00:28.590> collide<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.490> your

anything of that aspect assumes you're

already a bit of a programmer you're

already a bit of a programmer you're
just<00:01:21.930> unfamiliar<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.799> unity<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just unfamiliar with unity and I just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.190 
just unfamiliar with unity and I just
gotta<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.090> last<00:01:24.299> block<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.020> load

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
gotta get this last block so I can load

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
gotta get this last block so I can load
the<00:01:25.380> next<00:01:25.619> level<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.759> have

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the next level because we do have

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
the next level because we do have
loading<00:01:27.210> level<00:01:27.450> put<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> admit

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
loading level put in but I have to admit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.010 
loading level put in but I have to admit
