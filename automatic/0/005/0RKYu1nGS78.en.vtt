teardrops also focus will be getting a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.400 
teardrops also focus will be getting a
new<00:02:59.400> camera<00:02:59.670> as<00:03:00.060> well<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.660> we'll<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.019> making

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
put them on this long edge here so you

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.379 
put them on this long edge here so you
can<00:04:42.680> leave<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:42.979> like<00:04:43.009> this<00:04:43.160> this<00:04:43.880> isn't<00:04:44.090> really

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389
