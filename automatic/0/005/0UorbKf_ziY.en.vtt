to give you an overview of what's in the
system<00:03:42.460> as<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.730> come<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.960> it'll<00:03:44.110> run<00:03:44.380> and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
system as you come in so it'll run and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.140 
system as you come in so it'll run and
it<00:03:44.680> will<00:03:44.770> tell<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.040> where<00:03:45.280> anomalies

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
it will tell you where anomalies

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.240 
it will tell you where anomalies
signatures<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.080> wormholes<00:03:47.470> are<00:03:47.710> and<00:03:47.920> of

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
signatures and wormholes are and of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.320 
signatures and wormholes are and of
course<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.520> can<00:03:48.700> choose<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:48.940> play<00:03:49.240> around

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
course you can choose to play around

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.120 
course you can choose to play around
with<00:03:49.630> them<00:03:49.780> more<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.320> anomalies<00:03:50.800> you<00:03:50.980> can

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
with them more the anomalies you can

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.950 
with them more the anomalies you can
work<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.520> just<00:03:51.760> like<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.030> used<00:03:52.240> to<00:03:52.390> the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
work to just like you used to the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.380 
work to just like you used to the
signatures<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.710> can<00:03:53.860> probe<00:03:54.070> down<00:03:54.270> we've<00:03:55.270> made

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
signatures you can probe down we've made

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.330 
signatures you can probe down we've made
a<00:03:55.450> lot<00:03:55.510> of<00:03:55.690> changes<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.110> probing<00:03:56.530> as<00:03:56.650> well<00:03:56.830> so

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
a lot of changes to probing as well so

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.280 
a lot of changes to probing as well so
now<00:03:57.520> you<00:03:57.910> will<00:03:58.030> launch<00:03:58.210> your<00:03:58.390> probes<00:03:58.690> in<00:03:58.930> seven

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
now you will launch your probes in seven

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.840 
now you will launch your probes in seven
instead<00:03:59.740> of<00:03:59.860> one<00:04:00.010> at<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.190> time<00:04:00.400> because<00:04:00.610> we

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
instead of one at a time because we

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.150 
instead of one at a time because we
thought<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.210> was<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.360> little<00:04:01.540> bit<00:04:01.690> too

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
thought it was a little bit too

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.500 
thought it was a little bit too
time-consuming<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.970> click<00:04:04.180> all<00:04:04.390> of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
time-consuming to have to click all of

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.760 
time-consuming to have to click all of
them<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:04.750> we're<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:04.900> giving<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.410> ideal

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
them so we're just giving you the ideal

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.410 
them so we're just giving you the ideal
number<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.310> probes<00:04:06.580> how<00:04:06.790> are<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:06.940> positioned

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
number of probes how are you positioned

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.570 
number of probes how are you positioned
them<00:04:07.540> is<00:04:07.660> up<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.280> we'll<00:04:09.280> give<00:04:09.460> you<00:04:09.520> some

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
them is up to you we'll give you some

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.700 
them is up to you we'll give you some
standard<00:04:10.030> formations<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.870> play<00:04:11.230> around<00:04:11.470> with

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
standard formations to play around with

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.090 
standard formations to play around with
though<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.160> there<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.910> very<00:04:13.660> wide<00:04:14.260> reach

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
though so there is a very wide reach

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.860 
though so there is a very wide reach
scan<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.640> there's<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.820> very<00:04:15.910> pinpointing<00:04:16.750> one

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
scan and there's a very pinpointing one

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.630 
scan and there's a very pinpointing one
that<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.140> can<00:04:17.290> move<00:04:17.410> around<00:04:17.590> with<00:04:18.489> these

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
that you can move around with these

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.310 
that you can move around with these
probes<00:04:19.000> we've<00:04:19.330> also<00:04:19.540> played<00:04:19.870> around<00:04:20.049> with<00:04:20.170> the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
probes we've also played around with the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.230 
probes we've also played around with the
UI<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.739> course<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.430> results<00:04:21.850> look<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.090> bit

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
UI of course so the results look a bit

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.960 
UI of course so the results look a bit
better<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.770> bit<00:04:23.920> more<00:04:24.070> responsive<00:04:24.730> and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
better it's a bit more responsive and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.700 
better it's a bit more responsive and
and<00:04:25.150> kind<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.690> gives<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.110> feedback<00:04:26.320> you

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
and kind of gives you the feedback you

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.280 
and kind of gives you the feedback you
mean<00:04:26.890> so<00:04:27.730> once<00:04:27.940> you've<00:04:28.090> probed<00:04:28.870> these<00:04:29.050> sites

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
mean so once you've probed these sites

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.080 
mean so once you've probed these sites
down<00:04:29.470> you'll<00:04:30.040> notice<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.490> there's<00:04:30.850> a<00:04:30.940> new

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
down you'll notice that there's a new

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.590 
down you'll notice that there's a new
relic<00:04:31.450> site<00:04:31.660> which<00:04:32.500> contains<00:04:33.040> an<00:04:33.220> old<00:04:33.520> kind<00:04:34.480> of

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
relic site which contains an old kind of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.540 
relic site which contains an old kind of
looking<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.140> colony<00:04:35.770> ship<00:04:36.040> II<00:04:36.160> thing<00:04:36.370> you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
looking like a colony ship II thing you

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.130 
looking like a colony ship II thing you
can<00:04:36.730> explore<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.300> try<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.540> get<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.840> loot<00:04:38.020> out

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
can explore and try to get the loot out

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.880 
can explore and try to get the loot out
of<00:04:38.310> there's<00:04:39.310> also<00:04:39.520> data<00:04:40.450> sites<00:04:40.810> which<00:04:41.590> are<00:04:41.740> the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
of there's also data sites which are the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.160 
of there's also data sites which are the
equivalent<00:04:42.130> on<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.730> old<00:04:42.880> hacking<00:04:43.390> side<00:04:43.600> so

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
equivalent on the old hacking side so

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.450 
equivalent on the old hacking side so
there's<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.470> structure<00:04:44.920> in<00:04:45.010> there<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.400> you

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
there's a structure in there that you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.220 
there's a structure in there that you
can<00:04:45.640> go<00:04:45.790> in<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.120> kind<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.360> interface<00:04:46.810> with<00:04:47.050> and

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
can go in and kind of interface with and

00:04:47.230 --> 00:05:00.309 
can go in and kind of interface with and
try<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.410> break<00:04:47.620> into<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:48.130> get<00:04:48.280> what's<00:04:48.490> inside

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.400 

this<00:05:01.319> is<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.620> new<00:05:01.770> dataset<00:05:02.509> hack<00:05:03.509> it<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.930> find

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
this is the new dataset hack it and find

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:18.070 
this is the new dataset hack it and find
out<00:05:04.590> what's<00:05:05.310> inside

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.420 

it's<00:05:18.590> full<00:05:18.800> of<00:05:18.830> carbs

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.980 

and<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.060> should<00:05:22.240> always<00:05:22.420> bring<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.810> friend

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
and you should always bring a friend

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.780 
and you should always bring a friend
with<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.440> gather<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.860> camps<00:05:24.190> before<00:05:24.520> they

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
with you to gather the camps before they

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.760 
with you to gather the camps before they
drift<00:05:25.000> away<00:05:26.610> some<00:05:27.610> other<00:05:28.260> person<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.470> steal

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
drift away some other person to steal

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.930 
drift away some other person to steal
them<00:05:29.950> from<00:05:31.380> look<00:05:32.380> guard<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:33.070> can<00:05:33.730> see<00:05:33.910> that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
them from look guard I can see that

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.960 
them from look guard I can see that
you're<00:05:34.240> upset<00:05:34.300> about<00:05:34.630> this<00:05:35.170> I<00:05:35.440> honestly<00:05:36.370> think

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
you're upset about this I honestly think

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.570 
you're upset about this I honestly think
you<00:05:37.630> need<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:37.840> sit<00:05:38.110> down<00:05:38.170> calmly<00:05:38.650> take<00:05:39.550> a

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
you need to sit down calmly take a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.240 
you need to sit down calmly take a
stress<00:05:40.000> pill<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:40.510> think<00:05:41.170> things<00:05:41.350> over<00:05:44.190> but<00:05:45.190> I

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
stress pill and think things over but I
