00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
into my homemade hydroponic system so
first<00:00:31.439> you're<00:00:31.619> gonna<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> fill<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.399> the

up you want to fill it up just to the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.459 
up you want to fill it up just to the
point<00:00:36.450> where<00:00:37.040> these<00:00:38.040> little<00:00:39.079> things<00:00:40.079> will

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
point where these little things will

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.170 
point where these little things will
actually<00:00:41.629> sit<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.350> water<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.030> we're

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
actually sit in the water so how we're

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
actually sit in the water so how we're
going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> test<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.190> actually<00:00:47.399> do

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
going to test to see if they actually do

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.139 
going to test to see if they actually do
fit<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.770> put<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.510> top<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:52.760> make<00:00:53.760> sure<00:00:53.789> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
fit is put that top on make sure it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.470 
fit is put that top on make sure it's
nice<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.390> clicked<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.390> going

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
nice and clicked in and then we're going

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.599 
nice and clicked in and then we're going
to<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.719> ahead<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> put<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to go ahead and put one of these in and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.410 
to go ahead and put one of these in and
then<00:01:00.170> we'll<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.910> actually

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
then we'll see if it's if it's actually

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
then we'll see if it's if it's actually
and<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> water<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.650> drift<00:01:05.040> out

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and you can see water actually drift out

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.899 
and you can see water actually drift out
of<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.180> touching<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> water

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
of that so that is touching the water

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
of that so that is touching the water
obviously<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.890> even<00:01:11.040> kind<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> look<00:01:12.470> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
obviously you can even kind of look it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
obviously you can even kind of look it
might<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> too<00:01:13.950> dark<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.850> but

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
might be too dark to see in there but

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.980 
might be too dark to see in there but
you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.119> look<00:01:15.390> through<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> other

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you can look through one of the other

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130 
you can look through one of the other
holes<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.130> uh<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> sitting

use peat gravel but this would just fill
it<00:03:12.310> up<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.579> top<00:03:13.049> obvious<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.200> didn't<00:03:14.560> use

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
it up to the top obvious I didn't use

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.970 
it up to the top obvious I didn't use
all<00:03:14.920> these<00:03:15.239> because<00:03:16.239> some<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.170> volume<00:03:17.829> was

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
all these because some of the volume was

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.339 
all these because some of the volume was
displaced<00:03:18.400> by<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.930> that

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
displaced by like that

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.280 
displaced by like that
Rotom<00:03:23.430> put<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.549> another<00:03:24.670> one<00:03:24.970> there<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.049> now

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
Rotom put in another one there and now

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.839 
Rotom put in another one there and now
this<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.680> ready<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:26.980> be<00:03:27.099> stuck<00:03:27.489> into<00:03:27.670> your

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
this is ready to be stuck into your

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.189 
this is ready to be stuck into your
hydroponic<00:03:28.480> system<00:03:29.639> now<00:03:30.639> obviously<00:03:31.629> we're

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
hydroponic system now obviously we're

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.369 
hydroponic system now obviously we're
gonna<00:03:32.319> want<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> do<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:33.180> after<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.629> have<00:03:34.660> the

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
gonna want to do this after we have the

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.559 
gonna want to do this after we have the
water<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.849> nutrients<00:03:36.849> set<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.389> the

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
water and nutrients set up with the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.110 
water and nutrients set up with the
hydro<00:03:37.870> system<00:03:37.900> because<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:39.760> don't<00:03:39.910> want<00:03:40.030> this

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
hydro system because you don't want this

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.020 
hydro system because you don't want this
to<00:03:40.269> dry<00:03:40.419> out<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:41.079> course<00:03:41.379> it's<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.739> rap

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
to dry out of course it's in the rap

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.670 
to dry out of course it's in the rap
rock<00:03:43.030> wall<00:03:43.329> so<00:03:43.659> that<00:03:43.810> will<00:03:43.989> help<00:03:44.379> keep<00:03:44.530> it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
rock wall so that will help keep it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.210 
rock wall so that will help keep it
moist<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:46.919> basically<00:03:47.970> once<00:03:48.970> that's<00:03:49.269> all<00:03:50.220> your

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
moist but basically once that's all your

water's<00:03:51.549> all<00:03:51.819> set<00:03:52.090> up<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.720> basically<00:03:53.109> just

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
water's all set up this basically just

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.619 
water's all set up this basically just
drops<00:03:53.560> right<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.949> turn<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.549> your<00:03:55.349> your<00:03:57.629> your

all<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.859> plants<00:04:09.159> I'm<00:04:09.280> gonna<00:04:09.459> have<00:04:09.849> in<00:04:10.269> this

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
all the plants I'm gonna have in this

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.460 
all the plants I'm gonna have in this
these<00:04:11.919> three<00:04:12.280> are<00:04:12.400> spinach<00:04:12.819> and<00:04:13.419> the<00:04:14.260> rest

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
these three are spinach and the rest

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.830 
these three are spinach and the rest
right<00:04:14.680> now<00:04:14.859> or<00:04:15.069> romaine<00:04:15.459> lettuce<00:04:15.840> those

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
right now or romaine lettuce those

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.259 
right now or romaine lettuce those
should<00:04:17.139> grow<00:04:17.349> pretty<00:04:17.620> quickly<00:04:17.680> as<00:04:18.400> soon<00:04:19.000> as

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
should grow pretty quickly as soon as

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.600 
should grow pretty quickly as soon as
they<00:04:19.630> are<00:04:19.930> almost<00:04:20.889> ready<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:23.430> would<00:04:24.430> say

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
they are almost ready I would say

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.430 
they are almost ready I would say
another<00:04:24.789> like<00:04:25.060> three<00:04:25.330> weeks<00:04:25.510> once<00:04:26.139> they<00:04:26.289> grow

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
another like three weeks once they grow

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.279 
another like three weeks once they grow
big<00:04:26.650> enough<00:04:26.680> I'll<00:04:27.159> probably<00:04:27.430> use<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.659> couple<00:04:28.900> of

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
big enough I'll probably use a couple of

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.170 
big enough I'll probably use a couple of
them<00:04:29.409> and<00:04:29.650> then<00:04:30.370> throw<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.820> some<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.090> that

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
them and then throw in some of that

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.909 
them and then throw in some of that
butter<00:04:32.010> butter<00:04:33.010> head<00:04:33.280> lettuce<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:35.139> that<00:04:35.349> you

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
butter butter head lettuce and that you

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.600 
butter butter head lettuce and that you
know<00:04:36.039> so<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.340> way<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.580> can<00:04:36.729> utilize<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:38.380> also

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
know so that way I can utilize that also

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.360 
know so that way I can utilize that also
came<00:04:40.819> out<00:04:40.970> pretty<00:04:41.090> well<00:04:41.860> I've<00:04:42.860> got<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.159> pump

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
came out pretty well I've got the pump

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.580 
came out pretty well I've got the pump
going<00:04:43.550> as<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.389> can<00:04:44.509> see<00:04:44.750> right<00:04:44.960> over<00:04:45.349> in<00:04:45.470> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
going as you can see right over in the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.990 
going as you can see right over in the
corner<00:04:45.620> right<00:04:46.039> there

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
corner right there

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.219 
corner right there
pump<00:04:47.659> is<00:04:47.979> going<00:04:48.979> you<00:04:49.099> can<00:04:49.250> kind<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.490> hear<00:04:49.669> it

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
pump is going you can kind of hear it

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.219 
pump is going you can kind of hear it
and<00:04:51.280> actually<00:04:52.280> it's<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.360> double<00:04:53.389> pump<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.169> I'm

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
and actually it's a double pump and I'm

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.129 
and actually it's a double pump and I'm
putting<00:04:54.409> both<00:04:54.710> in<00:04:55.389> just<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.569> make<00:04:56.719> sure<00:04:56.930> that

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
putting both in just to make sure that

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.450 
putting both in just to make sure that
I'm<00:04:57.259> getting<00:04:57.530> enough<00:04:57.710> air<00:04:57.949> in<00:04:58.099> there<00:04:58.930> but

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
I'm getting enough air in there but

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.179 
I'm getting enough air in there but
hopefully<00:05:01.460> these<00:05:01.639> do<00:05:02.629> as<00:05:02.840> well<00:05:03.169> as<00:05:03.789> those

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
hopefully these do as well as those

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.670 
hopefully these do as well as those
those<00:05:07.189> really<00:05:07.849> really<00:05:08.180> did<00:05:08.360> well<00:05:08.509> if<00:05:09.409> they

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
those really really did well if they

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.809 
those really really did well if they
don't<00:05:09.919> I'll<00:05:10.310> probably<00:05:10.520> end<00:05:11.000> up<00:05:11.210> switching<00:05:11.750> to

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
don't I'll probably end up switching to

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.399 
don't I'll probably end up switching to
just<00:05:13.819> putting<00:05:14.210> just<00:05:14.479> filling<00:05:14.840> this<00:05:15.020> thing<00:05:15.229> up

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
just putting just filling this thing up

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.740 
just putting just filling this thing up
with<00:05:15.620> with<00:05:16.129> the<00:05:16.490> same<00:05:16.729> media<00:05:17.090> as<00:05:17.150> this<00:05:17.419> and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
with with the same media as this and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.279 
with with the same media as this and
then<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.949> know<00:05:19.069> planting<00:05:19.699> them<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.289> my

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
then you know planting them and my

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:28.290 
then you know planting them and my
lettuce<00:05:21.620> in<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.330> grow<00:05:23.539> media<00:05:24.009> so<00:05:26.740> now

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
lettuce in in that grow media so now
