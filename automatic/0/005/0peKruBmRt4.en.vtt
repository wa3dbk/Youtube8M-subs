00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.379
 we bring not only because he will be in the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.500
 alice roman but for the theme today is the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.549
 world day of down syndrome and a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 slogan in Argentina that I want 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.460
 highlighting over that of Spain is that of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.680
 do not be afraid do not be afraid that 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.630
 approaching to have contact with someone 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 I have dawn syndrome , I know 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.220
 enrich your life will change 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 I already have my first niece and goddaughter 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.670
 come up with down syndrome and I can 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 tell a personal story that has 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.379
 to do with this fear because when 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.350
 she was born none of us knew neither 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.730
 even mom knew that valentina 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.470
 he came with dawn syndrome 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.180
 had to do a duel this is very 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.260
 difficult to leave but really had to 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.900
 make a duel of a baby that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.270
 we were waiting and it did not arrive but we opened 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.579
 our heart a little influenced 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.800
 clear by people who approached us what 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.379
 he knew about the subject and that he told us that 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.290
 we were really going to feel the things of 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.830
 different way and go fight that the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.900
 things changed does not know how much life 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.820
 he taught us that we have a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.340
 gift tell you that we have direct line 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.170
 with her and surely we are going to 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 understand who are on the other side and 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.800
 who have the possibility of this 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.630
 round trip contact permanently 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.330
 with a boy with down syndrome because 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.550
 of inclusion is so important but not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.520
 only for them is also for us 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.619
 I remember about the boys 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
 of the syndrome of dawn a congress 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.490
 organized by astra where they came from 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.520
 all around the world we did it in a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.800
 Hotel in downtown center full were 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.460
 five thousand people between parents boys 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.180
 with dawn syndrome 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.540
 where I had to present at the mass 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.560
 there were four guys with dawn syndrome 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.649
 that they were going to exhibit 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.619
 never in my life as a journalist 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.590
 I also had fun 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.869
 never and I heard things so deep that 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.080
 do not listen to any other before 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.630
 person the open heart no doubt for 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.060
 to be able to listen in order to learn 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.730
 to see a little bit beyond the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.340
 images we are going to present to the team 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.230
 Paralympic that are called dolphins 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.030
 they say themselves we swim like 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.319
 Sharks wants to know the ones that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.950
 we are our venues are 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.950
 Argentines 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.150
 the dolphins were the story not 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.590
 only the country at the Paralympic level 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.620
 with mental disability but at the level 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.960
 world since they were the first 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.880
 swimmers with mental disabilities who 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.880
 they entered a Paralympic game 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.100
 and in 1992 it was the first game for 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.200
 ventilation madrid-barcelona with which 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.550
 these guys have a very story 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.920
 great not only at the country level but 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.050
 international that later gave so that 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.970
 many young promises like in this 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.340
 case I insist with are worth we have 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.990
 deposited that it is the continued of 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.480
 what we saw here today from his classmates 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.250
 and the dolphins in something mystical mystical 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.530
 in the mystic club in the mystical country 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.810
 world because it has a recognition 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.940
 really immense and today see them not in a 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.670
 flat obviously the performance but 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.010
 Carlos as an example for young people like 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.450
 vale and others more than just sports 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.840
 but as human values the ra that we 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.840
 full of pride 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.569
 because my hands do not come no no 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.230

 to computing in my house 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.000

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.620
 these groups appear and where 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.950
 you gather and come to practice 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.520
 sport and to share a better moment is 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.520
 the meeting 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.270
 at the initiative of the coach 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.390
 Paralympic Hernani Team Racing 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.520
 became in 1995 the first club of the 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.030
 country in having a dedicated commission 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.910
 specifically to disability and the 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.530
 sport as a teacher as a person from 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.120
 decades ago he had been giving a lot to the 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.870
 guys what do you give them to you 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.449
 and learning love and especially 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.699
 the desire of when one sometimes has a 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.430
 problem or you lock them levaban 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.919
 see that it really is insignificant and 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.440
 that everything as an old philosopher said 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.150
 for a problem in a solution and they 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.150
 they give it to you with facts of aviles 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.210
 good another phrase from dad francisco who 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.970
 I remember when I talk about the hypocrites 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.330
 it's not true and he said that it's enough to put 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.310
 face of stamps and the truth if you 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.350
 does not want anything at all hypocrisy 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.510
 connect with the kids with syndrome 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.790
 dawn because there they really are 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.940
 face of stamps but seriously because 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.970
 the importance will never betray you 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.680
 of inclusion that we all have 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.690
 awareness that beyond what to 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.610
 they do them very well yes clear to 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.170
 we do very well then the 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.900
 fact of being able to see in schools that 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.850
 our children have classmates 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.490
 integrated into common schools that is 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.800
 very good and it allows us to grow as 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.260
 society open the heart maybe today 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.220
 as if it were an excuse but for 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.220
 be for yourself
