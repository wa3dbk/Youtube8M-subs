00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
going to be about 25 of them for this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
going to be about 25 of them for this
machine<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.189> keep<00:01:26.369> them<00:01:26.580> pretty<00:01:26.759> short

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
machine and they keep them pretty short

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.520 
machine and they keep them pretty short
two<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> half<00:01:27.869> minutes<00:01:28.259> three<00:01:28.500> minutes

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
two and a half minutes three minutes

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.520 
two and a half minutes three minutes
long<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.939> kind<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.810> breaks<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.229> into

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
long that way kind of breaks up into

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
long that way kind of breaks up into
segments<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.280> makes<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:32.939> easier<00:01:33.060> for

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
segments and makes it a bit easier for

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.039 
segments and makes it a bit easier for
people<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.250> also<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.610> website<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:37.020> is

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
this particular machine is two Phillips

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.820 
this particular machine is two Phillips
screws<00:02:00.530> one<00:02:00.860> here<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.670> one<00:02:01.850> here<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:03.500> some

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
screws one here and one here and on some

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.800 
screws one here and one here and on some
of<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.190> later<00:02:04.550> models<00:02:05.090> you're<00:02:05.300> going<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.510> find

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
of the later models you're going to find

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.219 
of the later models you're going to find
that<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.350> screws<00:02:06.770> are<00:02:06.800> in<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.490> back<00:02:08.229> and

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
that the screws are in the back and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.260 
that the screws are in the back and
they're<00:02:09.619> quite<00:02:09.830> position<00:02:10.430> similar<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:11.060> this

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
they're quite position similar to this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.510 
they're quite position similar to this
but<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.020> back<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.950> you're<00:02:13.130> going<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.340> find

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
but in the back so you're going to find

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.430 
but in the back so you're going to find
an<00:02:13.670> eva<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.090> front<00:02:14.420> or<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.870> back

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
an eva in the front or in the back

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.860 
an eva in the front or in the back
so<00:02:15.740> let's<00:02:15.950> whip<00:02:16.160> those<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.090> we'll

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
so let's whip those out and then we'll

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.040 
so let's whip those out and then we'll
remove<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.410> console<00:02:18.830> i<00:02:22.390> would<00:02:23.390> suggest<00:02:23.570> using

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
remove the console i would suggest using

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.250 
remove the console i would suggest using
a<00:02:24.290> screw<00:02:24.620> gun<00:02:24.650> because<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.460> will<00:02:25.610> take<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.260> for

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
a screw gun because it will take you for

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.570 
a screw gun because it will take you for
ages<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.100> don't<00:02:29.620> alright<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.890> will<00:02:31.340> the

ages if you don't alright you will the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.420 
ages if you don't alright you will the
console<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.110> comes<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.190> see

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
console and up it comes you can see

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.090 
console and up it comes you can see
there's<00:02:34.730> some<00:02:34.940> dog<00:02:35.209> ears<00:02:35.600> right<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.890> that

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
there's some dog ears right here on that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.730 
there's some dog ears right here on that
side<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.730> side<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.360> they<00:02:39.050> go<00:02:39.290> into<00:02:39.500> these

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
side on this side and they go into these

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.590 
side on this side and they go into these
holes<00:02:40.100> here<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.580> that's<00:02:41.000> where<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.270> have<00:02:41.450> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
holes here so that's where you have to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.199 
holes here so that's where you have to
give<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.990> wriggle<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.650> get<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.920> out<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:44.060> to

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
give it a wriggle to get it out just to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.080 
give it a wriggle to get it out just to
go<00:02:44.360> over<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.110> components<00:02:45.920> here<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
go over the components here this is the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.120 
go over the components here this is the
water<00:02:47.330> level<00:02:47.570> control<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.440> way<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.830> works

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
water level control the way this works

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.870 
water level control the way this works
is<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.390> water<00:02:50.630> fills<00:02:51.080> up<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.620> tank<00:02:51.950> it

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
is as the water fills up in the tank it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.300 
is as the water fills up in the tank it
provides<00:02:53.390> air<00:02:53.690> pressure<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:54.709> hose<00:02:55.040> right

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
provides air pressure to this hose right

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.390 
provides air pressure to this hose right
here<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.080> air<00:02:57.290> pressure<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.890> throws

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
here and is the air pressure that throws

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.790 
here and is the air pressure that throws
the<00:02:58.430> switch<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.270> turns<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.840> water<00:02:59.989> off<00:03:00.440> and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
the switch and turns the water off and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000 
the switch and turns the water off and
tells<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.970> timer<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.690> start<00:03:02.989> agitating<00:03:03.260> you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
tells the timer to start agitating you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.560 
tells the timer to start agitating you
know<00:03:04.130> where<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> agitator<00:03:04.880> goes<00:03:05.120> back<00:03:05.360> and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
know where the agitator goes back and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.080 
know where the agitator goes back and
forth<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.959> your<00:03:06.050> wash<00:03:06.230> cycle<00:03:06.769> right<00:03:07.670> here<00:03:07.940> is

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
forth of your wash cycle right here is

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.360 
forth of your wash cycle right here is
the<00:03:08.239> temperature<00:03:08.720> control<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.980> gives<00:03:10.220> you

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the temperature control that gives you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.790 
the temperature control that gives you
your<00:03:10.550> hot<00:03:10.760> water<00:03:11.030> your<00:03:11.480> cold<00:03:11.750> water<00:03:12.110> or<00:03:12.590> both
