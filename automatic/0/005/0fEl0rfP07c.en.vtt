00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.340
 for hairstyles we just need 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.300
 socks yes you heard right 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.410

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.929
 I saw polinarepik polina hi and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:33.529
 Today I will use my video 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:33.529
 separates larger strand here is 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.240

 and cheat my mom before video like 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.430
 she learned on a rag, I was still 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.239
 very very small but for some reason 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.650
 rag always stayed a bunch of hair 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.400
 so terribly delayed everything is very simple 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.320
 but on all head it is required approximately 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.050
 5-6 socks not more than pervosti 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.190

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.910
 hard so i finished now dressed 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.910
 bandage 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:30.100

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.180

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.940

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.160
 rich beautiful makeup that will 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.160
 underline my eyes 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.179
 I equalize the tone of the face with a tone 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:52.179
 cream and brush kabuki sigma f80 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.920
 the area under the eyes I brighten 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.310
 concealer 2 tones lighter colors my 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 leather 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.610
 kabuki killing gancia in the skin 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.390
 but sponge and easy movements tidy up 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.390
 excess cream from the skin 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.710
 mandatory rule is to powder the skin 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.710
 after foundation 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.470
 correcting the shape of the eyebrow fill the voids 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.920
 lengthening them with a beveled brush and 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.770
 compact matte eye shadows 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.470

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.129
 and add brown in 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.129
 fold of the century 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.670

 I put shadows on a mobile eyelid leaving 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.140

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.390
 I apply silver shadows with a flat brush. 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.390

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.349
 straight line from the outer corner of the eye 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:30.169
 I draw the outline of the upper eyelid black 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:33.009
 Liquid eyeliner and bring the arrow for 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.009

 shadows and also bring the arrow outside 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.670
 the arrow angle should go below the silver 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.150
 add lilac pigment to lower eyelid 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.150

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.860
 silver shadows 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:15.429

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.610
 cheekbones look more voluminous 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:43.610
 and the face is healthy and fresh and won 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.190
