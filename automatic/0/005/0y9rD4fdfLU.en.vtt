00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.330
 [Music] 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello Polynesians today I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.580
 make a recipe that is delicious and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.340
 is very beautiful with rainbow gelatins 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.840
 they can not take to give for 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 a meeting for a party or 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.440
 just to eat at home look how 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.350
 it does 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.660
 first it happens to get the colors 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.000
 of the rainbow in jelly if you do not 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.210
 You find some color, check it 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.150
 a jelly that has no color is 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 gelatin can be aniseed and you can 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.190
 use dyes to put the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.890
 colors on the back of the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.809
 box comes the mixes and how many 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.700
 cuts you have to throw for each color 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.800
 then you will follow the instructions 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.900
 from the back of the box or 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.010
 gelatin sachets you are going to prepare 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.010
 all colors 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.510
 since it has all its stickers now 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.770
 you will let them cool until they are 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.170
 at room temperature 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.970
 while you face gelatins you are going to do 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.540
 the filling for the filling I'm going to use 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.920
 cream to beat or you can also 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.320
 use natural yogurt 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.720
 I'm going to take only the friendship that they are 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.490
 250 milliliters remember that the cream 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.530
 It has to be cool, I'm not going to 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 add sugar to the cream so that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.280
 it's so sweet our ported if 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.260
 you do with yogurt it 's the same and you go the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.270
 freezer stuff for 15 minutes 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.820
 now let's start serving the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.220
 jellies for this you can use a 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.530
 small glass or a glass I'll start 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.440
 with the purple color I will use a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.740
 funnel so that this is easier is not 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.050
 I squeeze the gelatine not going to stop 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.060
 10 to 15 minutes until your gelatin and 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.580
 it's well curdled since juanjo you 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 gelatin now the next step is going to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.890
 be to stir the cream that freezes t 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.860
 part of the fine dwelling you go to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.350
 stir and pour it into your glass what 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.390
 you are going to put 5 to 10 minutes to the fridge 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.550
 if you want it to be faster you can 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 put in the freezer since I take the part 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.850
 of the cream now I'm going to take the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.440
 next jelly color that in this 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.880
 case is the blue that obviously at 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.040
 freezer for 5 minutes 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.890
 now the layer that follows is cream that 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.900
 let's do with blue gelatin and what 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.430
 let's mix and that's what we're going to do 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.560
 With all colors, keep in mind 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.180
 How many colors are there to know the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.880
 amount of gelatin that you are going to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.739
 your boat and finally we're going to put it 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.570
 to the freezer and now with what we 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.910
 About this we are going to do our 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.160
 cream to decorate if you're going to put a 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.019
 little icing sugar for this sweet 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 since our cream was left in this 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.820
 consistency you're going to put the fridge in 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.040
 about 3 minutes just so that 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.019
 harden a little more now to decorate 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.730
 let's use a pastry bag if 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.519
 you do not have a pastry bag you can 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.840
 use a clean bag with a glass 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.550
 high it 's easier to put your bag and 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.580
 let's extract our cream elche what 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.640
 enough to decorate all your 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.450
 you are going to look for a tip of your bag and the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.910
 you are going to cut you are going to lower the cream 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.860
 and you're going to start decorating it you're going to do 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.720
 the same with all your jellies and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.400
 finally we will decorate with chochitos 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.019
 this you can when the super arrive 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.019
 in the part to decorate cakes 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.180

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.630

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.120
 a lot of pizza the pizza has needed 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.530
