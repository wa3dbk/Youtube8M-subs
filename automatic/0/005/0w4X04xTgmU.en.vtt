00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
okay guys I moved it inside all I'm

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay guys I moved it inside all I'm
doing<00:00:05.310> now<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.730> was<00:00:05.879> taking<00:00:06.150> some<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
doing now is I was taking some of this

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.500 
doing now is I was taking some of this
oil<00:00:06.980> and<00:00:07.980> I'm<00:00:08.220> sealing<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.120> it's

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
oil and I'm sealing it up and it's

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.240 
oil and I'm sealing it up and it's
making<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.019> turn<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.980> little<00:00:11.099> bit

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
making it turn it just a little bit

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.700 
making it turn it just a little bit
darker<00:00:11.990> which<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.110> think<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> look

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
darker which i think is going to look

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.410 
darker which i think is going to look
better<00:00:15.650> for<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> finished<00:00:18.210> clock

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
better for the for the finished clock

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.980 
better for the for the finished clock
anyway<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.150> going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> rub<00:00:21.539> oil<00:00:21.720> all

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
anyway so I'm just going to rub oil all

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
anyway so I'm just going to rub oil all
around<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.570> seal<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> up<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> might<00:00:25.830> end

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
around it and seal it up now I might end

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.710 
around it and seal it up now I might end
up<00:00:26.130> doing<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.490> twice<00:00:26.789> I'm<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.300> sure<00:00:27.480> yet

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
up doing this twice I'm not sure yet

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.690 
up doing this twice I'm not sure yet
we'll<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> goes<00:00:33.920> but<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.370> my

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
we'll see how it goes but this is my

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.650 
we'll see how it goes but this is my
next<00:00:36.120> step<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.940> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.210> process

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
next step here on this on the process

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
next step here on this on the process
here<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.050> clock<00:00:40.290> rubbing<00:00:41.190> oil<00:00:41.430> all<00:00:41.610> around

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
here for my clock rubbing oil all around

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
here for my clock rubbing oil all around
it<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:44.149> think<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.920> pretty

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it I think it's going to look pretty

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
it I think it's going to look pretty
nice<00:00:47.750> when<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.899> all<00:00:49.020> said<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.469> done<00:00:50.510> with

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
nice when it's all said and done with

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
nice when it's all said and done with
the<00:00:51.629> oil<00:00:51.840> soaked<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> real<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:58.609> that's<00:00:59.609> what

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the oil soaked in real good that's what

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
the oil soaked in real good that's what
we're<00:00:59.879> looking<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.719> hope<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we're looking at now I hope this is in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
we're looking at now I hope this is in
the<00:01:01.680> camera<00:01:01.890> okay<00:01:02.510> that's<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> color<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the camera okay that's the color that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
the camera okay that's the color that
we're<00:01:04.170> looking<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.400> we'll<00:01:06.000> let<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we're looking at now and we'll let it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.830 
we're looking at now and we'll let it
dry<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:08.430> may<00:01:08.909> put<00:01:09.119> another<00:01:09.330> coat<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
dry and then I may put another coat of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.039 
dry and then I may put another coat of
oil<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.070> let<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.280> soak<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.689> then

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
oil on here and let it soak in and then

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.310 
oil on here and let it soak in and then
I<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.439> drill<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> center<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> start

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I will drill out the center and start

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
I will drill out the center and start
putting<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.680> clock<00:01:16.890> pieces<00:01:17.280> together<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
putting our clock pieces together so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.060 
putting our clock pieces together so
when<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.409> point<00:01:19.650> I'll<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:19.950> back

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
when I get to that point I'll get back

my drill now drill me a hole right down
through<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> center<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> middle

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
through the center here in the middle

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.810 
through the center here in the middle
for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.680> clockworks<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.460> come

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
for the the the clockworks to come

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.410 
for the the the clockworks to come
through<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> hour<00:01:39.659> hand<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.430> minute

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
through for the hour hand and the minute

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.560 
through for the hour hand and the minute
hand<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> second<00:01:43.200> hand<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:44.930> so

hand in the second hand and so on so
just<00:01:48.570> judging<00:01:48.930> by<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.259> eyeball<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:52.670> you'll

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just judging by my eyeball here you'll

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.860 
just judging by my eyeball here you'll
see<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> drill<00:01:54.420> it

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:14.910 

well<00:02:04.870> I<00:02:04.900> guess<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:05.290> all<00:02:05.560> right<00:02:05.710> there<00:02:13.920> so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
well I guess it's all right there so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.110 
well I guess it's all right there so
there<00:02:15.070> we<00:02:15.190> go<00:02:17.280> got<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.459> more<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.970> drill

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
there we go got one more here to drill

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:41.280 
there we go got one more here to drill
out<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.700> know<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.850> know<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.209> was<00:02:40.510> being<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.020> little

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
have just released a couple of little

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.040 
have just released a couple of little
holes<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.920> time<00:02:51.130> being<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.270> there<00:02:52.570> we<00:02:52.690> go

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
holes for the time being so there we go

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.530 
holes for the time being so there we go
got<00:02:53.650> our<00:02:53.739> hole<00:02:53.920> drilled<00:02:53.950> now<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.209> little<00:02:55.420> bit

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
got our hole drilled now in a little bit

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.400 
got our hole drilled now in a little bit
when<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.750> start<00:02:55.930> putting<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.230> clock

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
when you start putting the clock

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650 
when you start putting the clock
together<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.120> when<00:02:58.270> they<00:02:58.360> get<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.600> point

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
together so when they get to that point
