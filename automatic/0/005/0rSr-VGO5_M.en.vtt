00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
weight and initially right off the bat

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.910 
weight and initially right off the bat
because<00:00:33.600> your<00:00:33.750> body's<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.140> used<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.710> what

you're doing and enlisted lose weight
eventually<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.329> body<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.469> gets<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
eventually your body kind of gets to a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.490 
eventually your body kind of gets to a
plateau<00:00:41.399> point<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.719> says<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.290> wait<00:00:43.469> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
are gonna offset a little bit because

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.539 
are gonna offset a little bit because
your<00:01:21.659> muscle<00:01:22.170> weight<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.650> weighs<00:01:23.070> more

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
your muscle weight actually weighs more

okay or your body fat wait so that's one
thing<00:01:29.479> why<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.720> scale<00:01:30.140> will<00:01:30.350> just<00:01:30.530> hit<00:01:30.710> that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
thing why the scale will just hit that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.790 
thing why the scale will just hit that
plateau<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.120> won't<00:01:32.330> be<00:01:32.420> budget<00:01:32.870> but<00:01:33.440> ask

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
plateau and you won't be budget but ask

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.580 
plateau and you won't be budget but ask
