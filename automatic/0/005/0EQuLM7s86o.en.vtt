00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
room temperature only to do it will take

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.840 
room temperature only to do it will take
them<00:02:01.009> straight<00:02:01.220> out<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.549> fridge<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:03.850> same

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
them straight out of the fridge and same

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.429 
them straight out of the fridge and same
with<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.149> oil<00:02:05.330> they<00:02:05.570> say<00:02:05.780> because<00:02:05.960> grapeseed

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
with the oil they say because grapeseed

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.499 
with the oil they say because grapeseed
oil<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.710> one<00:02:06.979> people<00:02:07.189> have<00:02:07.369> talked<00:02:07.640> about<00:02:07.909> the

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
oil and one people have talked about the

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.520 
oil and one people have talked about the
need<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.750> have<00:02:09.110> different<00:02:09.739> types<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.819> will<00:02:11.000> I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
need to have different types of will I

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.440 
need to have different types of will I
use<00:02:12.530> what<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.940> hand<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.910> mix<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.420> up

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
use what I have on hand so mix that up

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.180 
use what I have on hand so mix that up
now<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.200> step<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.590> changes<00:02:19.160> from

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
now this is the step that changes from

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.259 
now this is the step that changes from
me<00:02:19.519> every<00:02:19.819> day<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.510> take<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.470> butterfly<00:02:21.709> out

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.509 

back<00:02:26.269> on<00:02:26.480> now<00:02:26.780> pop<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.140> lid<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.799> way<00:02:28.069> now<00:02:28.250> so

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
back on now pop the lid in is way now so

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.199 
back on now pop the lid in is way now so
when<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.940> use<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:30.760> just<00:02:31.760> drain<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.180> oil

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
when you use that to just drain the oil

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.050 
when you use that to just drain the oil
through<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> put<00:02:33.620> 250<00:02:34.340> grams<00:02:34.549> of<00:02:34.700> all<00:02:34.850> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
through so I put 250 grams of all and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.720 
through so I put 250 grams of all and
it's<00:02:35.269> not<00:02:35.299> that<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.720> at<00:02:35.840> stake<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:37.370> if<00:02:37.549> I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it's not that up at stake for now if I

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.059 
it's not that up at stake for now if I
say<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:37.940> drizzle<00:02:38.269> this<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.980> know

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
say that drizzle this in you know

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.509 
say that drizzle this in you know
roughly<00:02:40.959> four<00:02:41.959> minutes<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:43.040> give<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.459> a

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
roughly four minutes I just give it a

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.860 
roughly four minutes I just give it a
bit<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:45.700> bit<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.850> drizzle

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.680 

and<00:02:49.959> stop<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.620> hear<00:02:50.860> it

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
I mean here there that solution so it's

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:55.880 
I mean here there that solution so it's
making<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.220> very<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.670> sound<00:03:41.030> like

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
mayonnaise now the last thing I'm going

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.309 
mayonnaise now the last thing I'm going
to<00:04:07.830> do<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.300> don't<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.050> step

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
to do is you don't have to do this step

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:24.530 
to do is you don't have to do this step
I'm<00:04:10.950> going<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.220> make<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.459> whole<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:24.390> can

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
I'm going to make it whole so you can

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.330 
I'm going to make it whole so you can
stop<00:04:24.720> at<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.930> other<00:04:25.080> step<00:04:25.350> misstep<00:04:25.919> makes<00:04:26.220> a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
stop at the other step misstep makes a

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.550 
stop at the other step misstep makes a
little<00:04:26.550> bit<00:04:26.700> more<00:04:27.020> liquidy<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.350> still

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
little bit more liquidy but it's still

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.890 
little bit more liquidy but it's still
quite<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.160> nice<00:04:29.400> nice<00:04:29.850> so<00:04:30.240> we'll<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.600> pop<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900
