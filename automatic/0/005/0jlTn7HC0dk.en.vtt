00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hi guys because I like guns 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.639
 today I will make a comparison between the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.900
 three main gauge zin point 50 or 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.820
 500 and I get questions saying if 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.730
 they are the same which are the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 differences and you're probably 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.789
 able to see some differences between 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.119
 they 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 so let's just talk it's your three 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.890
 other calibers 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.370
 it's just for comparison the end of the left 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 to the right 22 lr 380acp 50 action 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 express that is used in the deviation 500 of 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 mg 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.309
 from here it is used with people you know in the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 neighborhood where the 550i is edson and the 38 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:03.149
 special to the middle three like you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.220
 You see, it's instincts 80 and in 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.630
 50 one- inch point 50 of a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.369
 inch their sizes are from the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 left to right starting with 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:21.060
 with what is the 50 action express 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 it has 12 points 7 mm by 33 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.490
 millimeters in height of the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.619
 cartridge 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 the 500 thousand are essam that's the one he 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.200
 has 12 points 7 mm also by 41 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:45.500
 is almost 10 millimeters larger than 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:49.170
 than the minimum higher than the 51 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:57.090
 or 500 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:02.579
 a bmg 50 bmg sorry he has 12 points 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:06.390
 7 millimeters per 99 of the cartridge 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:11.099
 are so different so why the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 50 bmg is for use on rifles and has 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.500
 the shape of the cactus case 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.800
 rifle risk that is called the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.370
 bottle and the pressures are very 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.610
 larger than what is much stronger than 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.830
 the other two with short weapons and these 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.120
 two short weapons mission very strong 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:37.710
 why pass ballistic data now 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.550
 starting with 50 action express 50 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:45.060
 action express it a project of 300 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.620
 large or 19 grams has speed in 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.970
 1550 fixed pipe per century or 470 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.860
 meters per second 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.090
 energy of 1,600 fiulo or 2,200 already 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.500
 le coq 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.520
 the 500 smith wesson what is this here is a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.950
 project of 400 large with 26 grams is 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.350
 has a speed of one thousand eight hundred 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 stay paulo or who 50 meters by 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.420
 second 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:25.560
 power in the pipe of 2,877 reais or 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:29.760
 3901 jales 500 bmg 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.650
 sorry again the 50 bmg confused 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.620
 with 500,000 s-50 bmg has a project of 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.340
 700 large 45 grams 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.209
 the velocity in the pipe of 2,988 children per 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:52.550
 century or 908 meters per second 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:54.830
 is energy in the pipe 13.971 made paulo or 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.120
 18,942 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:04.709
 I think you could say that he would be 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:07.620
 a restricted caliber in brazil is good it 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.380
 is practically five times stronger than 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.440
 than I do in energy than the 500 mission 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.260
 edson and innocuous 11 9 times stronger than 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.519
 that action express ok 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:24.270
 and if you compare the the 500 thousand are 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.100
 edson and is almost twice the energy of 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.050
 50 action then express 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.680
 For you to have an idea are very 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.360
 different that the only similarity 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.330
 of them is the size of the diameter of the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.820
 design because the size of the project are 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.430
 are not compatible 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.610
 What the heck is he here? 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.590
 Typically the 50s typically express 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.190
 used in semiautomatic pistols the 500 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.730
 mission is only typically used in 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.890
 revolvers 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:05.860
 ok the 500 thousand with that one magnum is to have one 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.430
 model that get 500 000 is not only the 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.220
 which is the model of the revolver and the 5th dn 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.860
 usually used on rifles, I think 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.610
 that there is no short for him 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.960
 there are short weapons for other ke 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.600
 gauge rifles such as 545 for 39 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.120
 76 2% and 9 and 556 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.240
 there are some pistols in quotes that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:36.940
 wanted to use calibers of hostage but this 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:39.520
 here think it would be very indicated that 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.950
 resource a little too strong 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.540
 So that's all there is only showing 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.830
 you the difference compared to the 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.290
 gauges are allowed and 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.680
 anything any doubt 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.580
 the documentary kindly embraces you even more 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.580
 tchan
