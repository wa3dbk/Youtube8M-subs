00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.840
 it's exciting 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.669
 the second degree 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:09.879
 the station 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.969
 this winter 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.969
 young people coming out 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.589
 seen these breakers 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.460
 in the car 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.669
 I listened on rmc but the liquidator but he served very well 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.720
 firefighters 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.859
 m the 3ds and the wonders lasts week 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.190
 16:30 also attentive 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.910
 the art of their lives 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.840
 this is an essay

 Norwegian 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.100
 the study 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.240
 you found 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.580
 rector 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.040
 it's the alternative variety does not wait for the p 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.190
 it's not so much the humor and tears and the ump how could one say stop 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.460
 to melancholy sadness 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.110
 - and more serious things in the case of a very simple text 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.970
 it's the game I have a variety culture 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.680
 - I'm from the generation that comes when I listened to goldmann rondot 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.290
 david alavoine a seamstress so I have a real brand a real culture 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.970
 varieties and what made me want to do the stage and music 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.979
 that's when I saw the mano negra on stage so I think my music 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.680
 really matches me so just twinning 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.810
 the toddler was there immediately a little varietoche side yes 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 me in France mickaÃ«l 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.900
 and then the layers the costs of trust 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.960
 six nations 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.510
 at the start of the evening 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 I waited for it to continue 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 six former champions could take three points 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.870
 60 dead see 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.240
 follows fashion like everyone 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.690
 the damage arises like everyone else 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.070
 as to death 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.590
 sometimes you fall 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.840
 after such a match 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.220
 the ecologists 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.670
 fear of the dentist 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.310
 but not everything goes 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.709
 softened an example 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.179
 it's a super 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.739
 despite a chilly weather 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.939
 we do not consider it like that 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.349
 the presidential candidates 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.689
 Benmarraze 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 especially still by mid-August 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.159
 I believe that love can make a lot of moves 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.729
 can be the support for a lot of things 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.229
 more serious and more heavy 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.539
 the cumulative descent on stage is still more 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.619
 people are more 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.749
 it's still a good time we're not there for cafom new gazette 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.009
 cortaillod the same banks 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.009
 I think it's a real mix of both 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.479
 4 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.929
 by vincent bogard 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:02.509
 the werder bremen 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.659
 life laughs 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.419
 it's like once my first class 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.859
 I spend an evening talking about politics and 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.779
 dolphins in the world from 10 am to 5 pm 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.209
 I think that after half an hour tutoring 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 if all this is through a little humor of lightness 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.539
 two pats in the back of sales it's better 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.539
 the speech is not overused what 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.859
 still quite easily to agen 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.979
 I do not like it when I do not care why Europe 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.749
 after it's true 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.709
 at the same time it's not the day before when we should have been afraid too 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.690
 herat 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.219
 tortorella 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.249
 I am watching you 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.249
 saleh 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.999
 this is where ever 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.999
 son of a baritone 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 on the other hand I am so happy said elizabeth 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.849
 obama and sarkozy is quoted 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.319
 you echo once I can not do it so it'll make you 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:29.930
 fuck 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.349
 the ultimate goal 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.590
 so this is the present moment khimki 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.590
 that's when it's that moment that it's going to happen 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.550
 besides feeling the strongest in the world 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.629
 the fact that the plate 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.939
 in this perspective the scene he has in the world 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.659
 congratulate him see that people 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.229
 near the pleasure to all before
