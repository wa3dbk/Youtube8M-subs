00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
run the signed up but like so this is a

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.810 
run the signed up but like so this is a
pretty<00:03:46.090> simple<00:03:46.420> one<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.830> find<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.370> easier<00:03:48.760> i

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
pretty simple one so I find it easier i

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.550 
pretty simple one so I find it easier i
mean<00:03:49.120> i've<00:03:49.270> seen<00:03:49.510> some<00:03:49.720> other<00:03:49.930> versions<00:03:50.440> of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560

signed out of this sign auto sign
program<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.280> i<00:03:54.520> find<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.810> easiest

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
program but i find this is the easiest

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.430 
program but i find this is the easiest
