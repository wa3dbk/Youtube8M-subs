either<00:00:30.180> of<00:00:30.450> these<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.989> now<00:00:31.680> one<00:00:31.860> tip<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.810> take

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
either of these two now one tip is take

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.380 
either of these two now one tip is take
your<00:00:33.989> bottles<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> always<00:00:35.399> keep<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.880> upside

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
your bottles and always keep them upside

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.710 
your bottles and always keep them upside
down<00:00:36.530> in<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> glass<00:00:37.890> jar<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.450> means

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
down in a glass jar like so that means

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.389 
down in a glass jar like so that means
that<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> outliner<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> always<00:00:41.040> running

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that your outliner is always running

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.009 
that your outliner is always running
down<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.760> bottom<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:42.929> have

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
down to the bottom because they have

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.540 
down to the bottom because they have
nozzles<00:00:43.289> on<00:00:43.679> the<00:00:43.710> end<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.250> they're<00:00:44.399> always

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
nozzles on the end and they're always

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.439 
nozzles on the end and they're always
ready<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.289> now<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.890> 25<00:00:47.460> mil<00:00:47.789> has<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> nice

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
ready to go now the 25 mil has a nice

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
ready to go now the 25 mil has a nice
small<00:00:49.410> nozzle<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> end<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:53.070> my

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
small nozzle on the end like so now my

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
small nozzle on the end like so now my

so if you keep them upside down all the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.219 
so if you keep them upside down all the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
time just literally just play around at

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.370 
time just literally just play around at
first<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.740> squeeze<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> outliner<00:01:18.380> out

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
first just squeeze in the outliner out

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
first just squeeze in the outliner out
of<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.740> bottle<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> saw<00:01:21.149> that<00:01:21.180> broke

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
of the bottle now you saw that broke

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.969 
of the bottle now you saw that broke
though<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> haven't<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
though that's because I haven't had the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
though that's because I haven't had the
bottles<00:01:23.369> upside<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.899> keep<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bottles upside down now if you keep the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
bottles upside down now if you keep the
bottle<00:01:25.350> upside<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.969> liquid

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
bottle upside down because the liquid

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
bottle upside down because the liquid
outliner<00:01:28.079> goes<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.649> way<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
outliner goes all the way down to the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.780 
outliner goes all the way down to the
bottom<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.840> near<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> nozzle<00:01:31.790> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
bottom of down here near the nozzle you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
bottom of down here near the nozzle you
won't<00:01:32.969> get<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.299> ball<00:01:34.100> splashing<00:01:35.100> sound<00:01:35.399> all

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
won't get that ball splashing sound all

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.550 
won't get that ball splashing sound all
over<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.969> place<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.450> literally<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
over the place so literally just get a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
over the place so literally just get a
play<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> piece<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.579> glass<00:01:39.570> piece<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.170> film

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
play get a piece of glass piece of film

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.550 
play get a piece of glass piece of film
and<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.399> feel<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.299> outline<00:01:42.780> now

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and just get the feel of the outline now

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139 
and just get the feel of the outline now
the<00:01:43.619> technique<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:44.640> using<00:01:44.789> South

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the technique of actually using South

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.800 
the technique of actually using South
Mangler<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> onto<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
Mangler is not not to put it onto the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
Mangler is not not to put it onto the
glass<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> squeeze<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.189> pull<00:01:50.369> along<00:01:50.640> like

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
glass and squeeze and pull along like

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.450 
glass and squeeze and pull along like
that<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.500> rich<00:01:52.770> irregular

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that because you get very rich irregular

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
that because you get very rich irregular
lines<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.270> bubbles<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.229> blobs<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
lines and bubbles and blobs and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.679 
lines and bubbles and blobs and
everything<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> lovely<00:01:57.060> smooth

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
everything not to get a lovely smooth

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.529 
everything not to get a lovely smooth
nice<00:01:58.170> line<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.250> best<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.149> actually

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
nice line the best thing is to actually

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.770 
nice line the best thing is to actually
touch<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> glass<00:02:02.310> or<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.820> film<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.390> lift<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
touch the glass or the film and lift it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.210 
touch the glass or the film and lift it
up<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.289> lay<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.509> glass<00:02:07.220> when

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
up and lay it down on to the glass when

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
design there for instance you just can

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.050

see how small it is but if you want to

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.969 
see how small it is but if you want to
enlarge<00:06:15.330> that<00:06:15.630> just<00:06:15.840> take<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.199> book<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.949> a

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
enlarge that just take the book to a

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.430 
enlarge that just take the book to a
photocopier<00:06:17.789> and<00:06:18.150> then<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:18.900> can<00:06:19.050> just<00:06:19.260> do

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
photocopier and then you can just do

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.810 
photocopier and then you can just do
things<00:06:19.650> like<00:06:19.919> this

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
things like this

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.120 
that to 50% then I enlarge that to 75%
enlarged<00:06:30.420> it<00:06:30.540> again<00:06:30.840> to<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.650> size<00:06:31.860> that<00:06:32.070> I
