00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.449 
got a green mo half of them he couldn't
resist<00:02:12.950> he<00:02:13.490> get<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> raise<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:16.420> hmm<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:18.459> still

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
resist he get a raise is hmm I still

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.880 
resist he get a raise is hmm I still
feel<00:02:19.820> like<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.090> 90<00:02:20.330> 100<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.230> tiny<00:02:21.650> bit

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
feel like the 90 100 is you tiny bit

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
feel like the 90 100 is you tiny bit
smoother<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.489> very<00:02:22.760> very<00:02:22.970> close<00:02:23.239> what<00:02:23.930> else

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
smoother it is very very close what else

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.660 
smoother it is very very close what else
I'm<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.260> noticing<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.070> them<00:02:25.250> yeah

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
I'm just noticing can you see them yeah

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.500 
I'm just noticing can you see them yeah
it's<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.970> way<00:02:26.060> it's<00:02:26.180> starting<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.480> set<00:02:26.690> yeah

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
it's the way it's starting to set yeah

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.070 
it's the way it's starting to set yeah
there's<00:02:29.510> actually<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:29.900> bit<00:02:29.989> of

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
there's actually a little bit of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.380 
there's actually a little bit of
separation<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.310> Vitamix<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
separation in the Vitamix is that the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.360 
separation in the Vitamix is that the
Vitamix<00:02:32.810> yeah<00:02:33.110> yeah<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.860> let's<00:02:34.040> have<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.190> little

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
Vitamix yeah yeah so let's have a little

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.120 
Vitamix yeah yeah so let's have a little
bit<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.580> peek<00:02:34.760> at<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.750> close-up<00:02:36.080> as<00:02:36.500> well

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
bit of a peek at that close-up as well

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.220 
bit of a peek at that close-up as well
otherwise<00:02:37.760> they're<00:02:38.000> generally<00:02:38.420> pretty<00:02:38.450> close

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
otherwise they're generally pretty close

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.500 
otherwise they're generally pretty close
I<00:02:39.560> think<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.700> knife<00:02:41.030> one<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.390> is

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
I think that the knife one it is

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.720 
I think that the knife one it is
slightly<00:02:41.930> smoother<00:02:42.410> Rory<00:02:43.010> what<00:02:43.310> did<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.519> find

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
slightly smoother Rory what did you find

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.850 
slightly smoother Rory what did you find
I<00:02:43.940> found<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.630> same<00:02:45.050> actually<00:02:45.500> yeah

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
I found the same actually yeah

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.710 
I found the same actually yeah
especially<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.730> spreading<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.209> out<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.360> found

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
especially is spreading it out I found

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.170 
especially is spreading it out I found
that<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.530> 9400<00:02:49.280> had<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.489> little<00:02:49.820> bit<00:02:49.970> less

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that the the 9400 had a little bit less

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.979 
that the the 9400 had a little bit less
grit<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:51.110> um<00:02:51.459> then<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.760> verb<00:02:53.420> onyx<00:02:53.780> and

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
grit then um then the verb onyx and

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.110 
grit then um then the verb onyx and
taste<00:02:54.470> wise<00:02:54.709> as<00:02:54.980> well<00:02:55.190> yeah<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.850> we'll<00:02:55.970> do<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
taste wise as well yeah and we'll do a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.000 
taste wise as well yeah and we'll do a
little<00:02:56.239> close-up<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:57.170> hope<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.590> our<00:02:57.709> camera

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
little close-up and hope that our camera

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.740 
little close-up and hope that our camera
can<00:02:58.130> catch<00:02:58.340> what<00:02:58.550> I'm<00:02:58.670> seeing<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.540> can

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
can catch what I'm seeing but I can

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.990 
can catch what I'm seeing but I can
actually<00:02:59.930> see<00:03:00.500> some<00:03:00.709> separation<00:03:01.220> where<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
actually see some separation where the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.940 
actually see some separation where the
liquid<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.810> solids<00:03:03.200> are<00:03:03.350> separating<00:03:03.830> in

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
liquid and the solids are separating in

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.190 
liquid and the solids are separating in
the<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.130> from<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.430> Vitamix<00:03:04.850> well<00:03:05.750> we'll<00:03:06.080> do

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the one from the Vitamix well we'll do

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.570 
the one from the Vitamix well we'll do
the<00:03:06.320> close-ups<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:06.950> we'll<00:03:07.160> see<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:07.459> our

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
the close-ups and we'll see with our

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:18.690 
the close-ups and we'll see with our
next<00:03:07.760> recipe<00:03:07.910> back<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.870> sec

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.760
