Jordan<00:00:15.269> eltham<00:00:15.509> demon<00:00:15.809> talking<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
Jordan eltham demon talking about the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.859 
Jordan eltham demon talking about the
hockey<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.130> much<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.820> channel<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.449> I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
hockey not so much the channel and I

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.050 
hockey not so much the channel and I
guess<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.949> including<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> entrances<00:00:21.029> so
