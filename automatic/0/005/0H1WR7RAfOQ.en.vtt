00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
idea that that rugby you know at first

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060 
idea that that rugby you know at first
look<00:01:36.000> wasn't<00:01:36.270> maybe<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.780> time<00:01:37.320> consuming<00:01:37.890> was

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
look wasn't maybe as time consuming was

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
look wasn't maybe as time consuming was
a<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:39.119> thing<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.960> drove<00:01:40.140> me<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
a the first thing that drove me to it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920 
a the first thing that drove me to it
but<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> began<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> play<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> more

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
but then when I began to play it more

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
but then when I began to play it more
and<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.380> saw<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> level<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.490> play<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and more and saw the level of play that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.429 
and more and saw the level of play that
we<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.140> hear<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> at<00:01:46.710> BYU<00:01:48.439> that's

what<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:50.369> me<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> stick<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
what really got me is stick with it and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
what really got me is stick with it and
keep<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:52.579> for<00:01:53.579> people<00:01:53.880> who<00:01:54.000> aren't

keep going for people who aren't

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
keep going for people who aren't
familiar<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.899> rules<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.229> mean<00:01:55.409> sometimes

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
familiar with the rules I mean sometimes

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
familiar with the rules I mean sometimes
we<00:01:55.950> hear<00:01:56.070> people<00:01:56.399> joke<00:01:56.430> about<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.060> rules<00:01:57.270> or

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
we hear people joke about the rules or

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
we hear people joke about the rules or
the<00:01:57.509> scrum<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.680> tell<00:01:58.950> us<00:01:58.979> something<00:01:59.490> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that the casual fan outside watching

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.190 
that the casual fan outside watching
might<00:02:02.729> need<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> learn<00:02:03.149> about<00:02:03.479> rugby<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.020> watch

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
game if you look at it and not not used

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.920 
game if you look at it and not not used
to<00:02:09.000> looking<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:10.319> looks<00:02:10.349> like

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
to looking at it it looks like

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.289 
to looking at it it looks like
you<00:02:12.500> know<00:02:12.620> some<00:02:12.920> crazy<00:02:13.129> game<00:02:13.609> guys<00:02:14.000> just

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
you know some crazy game guys just

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.390 
you know some crazy game guys just
running<00:02:14.599> around<00:02:14.719> but<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.859> very<00:02:16.159> technical

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
running around but it's very technical

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.170 
running around but it's very technical
there's<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.150> lot<00:02:17.329> of<00:02:18.010> technique<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.340> patterns

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
there's a lot of technique and patterns

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660 
there's a lot of technique and patterns
and<00:02:20.420> moves<00:02:20.629> involved<00:02:21.379> in<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:22.189> sort<00:02:22.579> of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
and moves involved in it it's sort of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.470 
and moves involved in it it's sort of
like<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:24.799> know<00:02:24.829> if<00:02:25.159> you<00:02:25.370> really<00:02:25.579> break<00:02:25.849> it<00:02:25.939> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
like you know if you really break it and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.119 
like you know if you really break it and
it's<00:02:26.599> not<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> great<00:02:27.109> analogy<00:02:27.409> but<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.010> does

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
it's not a great analogy but it does

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.629 
it's not a great analogy but it does
analogy<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:29.359> a<00:02:29.450> cross<00:02:29.750> between<00:02:30.639> football

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
the hours that it's going to take to

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.580 
the hours that it's going to take to
accomplish<00:03:14.719> that<00:03:15.290> goal

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
accomplish that goal

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.039 
accomplish that goal
it's<00:03:16.459> always<00:03:16.579> been<00:03:16.879> a<00:03:16.909> preconceived<00:03:17.599> idea<00:03:17.810> of

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
it's always been a preconceived idea of

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.839 
it's always been a preconceived idea of
mine<00:03:18.349> I<00:03:18.379> guess<00:03:18.709> maybe<00:03:18.979> other<00:03:19.250> people<00:03:19.609> that

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
mine I guess maybe other people that

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.869 
mine I guess maybe other people that
rugby<00:03:20.540> players<00:03:20.959> are<00:03:21.319> tougher<00:03:21.919> if<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.609> is

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
rugby players are tougher if that is

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.369 
rugby players are tougher if that is
that<00:03:23.060> true<00:03:23.299> or<00:03:23.389> how<00:03:23.690> do<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.810> feel<00:03:24.019> about<00:03:24.109> that

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
that true or how do you feel about that

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.869 
that true or how do you feel about that
statement<00:03:24.620> well<00:03:24.979> of<00:03:25.159> course<00:03:25.220> I'd<00:03:25.549> like<00:03:25.699> to

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
statement well of course I'd like to

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.550 
statement well of course I'd like to
think<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:26.479> a<00:03:26.810> little<00:03:26.959> biased<00:03:27.199> though

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
think so I'm a little biased though

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.009 
think so I'm a little biased though
towards<00:03:27.859> regular<00:03:28.189> players<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.900> yeah

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
towards regular players but yeah

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.659 
towards regular players but yeah
definitely<00:03:30.229> we<00:03:30.620> have<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.979> have<00:03:31.129> a<00:03:31.159> tenacity

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
definitely we have to have a tenacity

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.479 
definitely we have to have a tenacity
