00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
all right actually let's take off that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.219 
all right actually let's take off that
reflection<00:02:03.759> all<00:02:04.210> right<00:02:04.329> just<00:02:04.689> plain<00:02:05.020> blue

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
reflection all right just plain blue

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.649 
reflection all right just plain blue
right<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.340> oh<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:07.210> won't<00:02:07.299> be<00:02:07.479> anything

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
right now it oh it won't be anything

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.070 
right now it oh it won't be anything
because<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.470> have<00:02:08.769> ambient<00:02:09.369> occlusion<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:10.080> um

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
because I have ambient occlusion and um

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.360 
because I have ambient occlusion and um
what<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.160> call<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:12.700> right<00:02:12.940> now<00:02:13.049> mmm<00:02:14.370> this

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
what you call it so right now mmm this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.580 
what you call it so right now mmm this
will<00:02:15.549> be<00:02:15.640> what<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:15.879> looks<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.440> looks<00:02:17.440> like

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
will be what it looks like looks like

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.500 
will be what it looks like looks like

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
 yeah um so yeah let's just throw it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.089 
 yeah um so yeah let's just throw it
back<00:02:22.660> on<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:22.959> there<00:02:23.140> put<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.470> floor<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.890> there

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
back on in there put the floor on there

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.490 
back on in there put the floor on there
and<00:02:24.340> make<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.239> composite<00:02:25.599> so<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.049> looks<00:02:26.200> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and make a composite so it looks a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.130 
and make a composite so it looks a
little<00:02:26.860> better<00:02:27.040> um<00:02:28.110> composite<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
little better um composite the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.530 
little better um composite the
background<00:02:29.560> okay<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.579> right<00:02:30.880> now<00:02:30.910> make<00:02:31.510> sure

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
background okay so right now make sure

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.089 
background okay so right now make sure
everyone<00:02:31.870> has<00:02:32.079> ambient<00:02:32.650> occlusion<00:02:32.769> and

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
everyone has ambient occlusion and

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.339 
everyone has ambient occlusion and
global<00:02:33.640> illumination<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:34.269> i<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.750> put<00:02:35.290> the

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
global illumination on i will put the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.809 
global illumination on i will put the

settings<00:02:40.360> um<00:02:40.680> I'll<00:02:41.680> put<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.160> there<00:02:42.340> so

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
settings um I'll put that in there so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.479 
settings um I'll put that in there so
for<00:02:43.660> soft<00:02:43.900> boxes<00:02:44.290> they're<00:02:44.500> pretty<00:02:44.829> pretty

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
for soft boxes they're pretty pretty

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.940 
for soft boxes they're pretty pretty
easy<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.880> use<00:02:46.000> actually<00:02:46.420> first<00:02:47.260> off<00:02:47.470> just<00:02:47.709> make

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
easy to use actually first off just make

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.680 
easy to use actually first off just make
a<00:02:47.980> plane<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.549> this<00:02:48.849> is<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.120> how<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.269> learned

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
a plane and this is just how I learned

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.589 
a plane and this is just how I learned
how<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.680> also<00:02:50.829> change<00:02:51.190> the

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
how to do it you can also change the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.460 
how to do it you can also change the
settings<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.780> whatever<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.170> need<00:02:53.319> them<00:02:53.440> for

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
settings to whatever you need them for

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.860 
settings to whatever you need them for
um<00:02:54.430> I'll<00:02:55.090> put<00:02:55.379> let's<00:02:56.379> just<00:02:56.470> say<00:02:56.769> 600<00:02:57.609> x<00:02:58.239> 600

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
um I'll put let's just say 600 x 600

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.990 
um I'll put let's just say 600 x 600
that'll<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.769> size<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.160> your<00:03:00.250> soft<00:03:00.549> box<00:03:00.760> for

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
that'll be the size of your soft box for

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.360 
that'll be the size of your soft box for
now<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> pretty<00:03:03.400> good<00:03:03.579> size<00:03:03.639> for<00:03:04.150> soft<00:03:04.840> box

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
now it's a pretty good size for soft box

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:14.759 
now it's a pretty good size for soft box
let's<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.579> uh<00:03:07.709> move<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.889> uh<00:03:11.489> put<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.639> at<00:03:13.769> 90

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
let's just uh move it uh put it at 90

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.370 
let's just uh move it uh put it at 90
degrees<00:03:15.030> there<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.120> go<00:03:16.239> alright<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.319> that's

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
degrees there you go alright so that's

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.620 
degrees there you go alright so that's
all<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.769> right<00:03:17.920> now<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.280> then<00:03:18.609> um<00:03:18.910> going<00:03:19.540> to

all it is right now and then um going to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.910 
all it is right now and then um going to
lights<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.200> do<00:03:21.510> area<00:03:22.510> light<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.739> right<00:03:23.889> now

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
lights and do area light so right now

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.099 
lights and do area light so right now
this<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.000> light<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.510> have<00:03:25.690> bring<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
this is the light that you have bring it

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.740 
this is the light that you have bring it
up<00:03:26.200> here<00:03:26.310> where<00:03:27.310> your<00:03:27.430> soft<00:03:27.670> boxes<00:03:28.090> are<00:03:28.510> with

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
up here where your soft boxes are with

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.229 
up here where your soft boxes are with
where<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.170> plane<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:30.000> change<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:33.239> change

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
where the plane is and change the change

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.860 
where the plane is and change the change
the<00:03:35.370> outer<00:03:36.370> radius<00:03:36.790> yeah<00:03:36.970> go<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.209> details<00:03:37.599> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.659 
the outer radius yeah go to details and
change<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.230> outer<00:03:38.380> radius<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.829> that<00:03:38.950> let's

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
change the outer radius of that let's

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:46.229 
change the outer radius of that let's
put<00:03:39.819> it<00:03:39.940> at<00:03:40.139> 300<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.280> perfect<00:03:45.280> size<00:03:45.519> Wow

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.610 
yeah change that and let's see here
after<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:13.690> go<00:04:14.110> make<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.440> material

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
after that you just go make a material

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.210 
after that you just go make a material
really<00:04:15.040> quick<00:04:15.370> um<00:04:15.640> take<00:04:16.570> off<00:04:16.720> everything

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
really quick um take off everything

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.240 
really quick um take off everything
except<00:04:18.420> illuminance<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.919> just<00:04:20.919> have<00:04:21.070> that

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
except illuminance and just have that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.590 
except illuminance and just have that
plane<00:04:21.459> material<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.030> don't<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.270> change<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
plane material you don't you change the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.480 
plane material you don't you change the
color<00:04:22.810> or<00:04:22.870> else<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.200> have<00:04:23.380> like<00:04:23.560> weird-ass

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
color or else you have like weird-ass

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.280 
color or else you have like weird-ass
lighted<00:04:24.970> materials<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.780> have<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:26.050> blue

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
lighted materials you have like blue

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.250 
lighted materials you have like blue
lights<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.810> don't<00:04:28.930> really<00:04:29.020> want

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
lights and so you don't really want

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.010 
lights and so you don't really want
that<00:04:29.410> so<00:04:29.950> just<00:04:30.430> drag<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.850> luminance<00:04:31.390> onto<00:04:31.840> the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
that so just drag the luminance onto the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.440 
that so just drag the luminance onto the
plane<00:04:32.350> you've<00:04:32.980> got<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.250> bright<00:04:33.580> bright

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
plane you've got that bright bright

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.670 
plane you've got that bright bright
luminance<00:04:35.080> um<00:04:36.720> say<00:04:37.720> after<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.169> ah<00:04:38.410> let's<00:04:39.400> see

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
luminance um say after that ah let's see

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.250 
luminance um say after that ah let's see
go<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.740> your<00:04:41.980> plane<00:04:42.280> go<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.300> tags<00:04:43.660> cinema4d

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
go to your plane go to tags cinema4d

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.930 
go to your plane go to tags cinema4d
tags<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.190> compositing<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.440> take<00:04:47.440> off

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
tags and compositing and take off

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.710 
tags and compositing and take off
receive<00:04:48.940> shadows<00:04:50.340> cast<00:04:51.340> shadows<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:51.970> seen<00:04:52.690> by

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
receive shadows cast shadows and seen by

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.930 
receive shadows cast shadows and seen by
camera<00:04:53.200> so<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:53.440> can't<00:04:53.710> see<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.190> light<00:04:54.400> itself

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
camera so you can't see the light itself

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.220 
camera so you can't see the light itself
um<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:58.890> yeah<00:04:59.940> put<00:05:00.940> all<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.540> then<00:05:01.570> go

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
um and yeah put all that in and then go

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.530 
um and yeah put all that in and then go
to<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.950> square<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.580> don't<00:05:04.240> an<00:05:04.360> OLE<00:05:04.510> object

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
to the square and don't an OLE object

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.170 
to the square and don't an OLE object
and<00:05:05.230> just<00:05:05.860> name<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:06.340> whatever<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.760> want<00:05:06.910> this

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
and just name it whatever you want this

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.060 
and just name it whatever you want this
can<00:05:07.390> just<00:05:07.419> be<00:05:08.940> soft<00:05:09.940> box<00:05:10.710> that'll<00:05:11.710> your<00:05:11.919> soft

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
can just be soft box that'll your soft

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.300 
can just be soft box that'll your soft
box<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.810> can<00:05:13.960> just<00:05:14.080> drag<00:05:14.500> these<00:05:14.740> two<00:05:15.010> on

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
box and you can just drag these two on

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.180 
box and you can just drag these two on
two<00:05:15.820> here<00:05:16.120> on<00:05:16.330> your<00:05:17.200> soft<00:05:17.470> box<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:17.890> now<00:05:18.040> it's

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
two here on your soft box so now it's

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.650 
two here on your soft box so now it's
one<00:05:18.550> object<00:05:18.940> when<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.150> drag<00:05:19.360> this<00:05:19.510> around

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
one object when you drag this around

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.420 
one object when you drag this around
it'll<00:05:20.290> drag<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.680> light<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.160> plane

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
it'll drag the light and the plane

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.200 
it'll drag the light and the plane
around<00:05:22.560> see<00:05:23.560> ya<00:05:23.680> now<00:05:23.860> when<00:05:24.040> you<00:05:24.130> go<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.310> softbox

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
around see ya now when you go to softbox

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.880 
around see ya now when you go to softbox
put<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:25.780> same<00:05:25.960> exact<00:05:26.260> tags<00:05:26.470> as<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.710> did<00:05:26.860> for

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
put the same exact tags as you did for

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.060 
put the same exact tags as you did for
the<00:05:27.040> plane<00:05:27.370> just<00:05:28.210> put<00:05:28.419> a<00:05:28.680> cast<00:05:29.680> shadows

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
the plane just put a cast shadows

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.730 
the plane just put a cast shadows
receive<00:05:30.370> shadows<00:05:30.729> seen<00:05:30.970> by<00:05:31.090> camera<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.740> just

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
receive shadows seen by camera and just

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.330 
receive shadows seen by camera and just
do<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:33.760> then<00:05:34.330> we<00:05:34.570> can<00:05:34.750> move<00:05:35.530> move<00:05:36.190> where

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
do that and then we can move move where

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.909 
do that and then we can move move where
the<00:05:36.460> softbox<00:05:36.880> it's<00:05:37.090> going<00:05:37.330> move<00:05:38.200> how<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:38.710> want

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
the softbox it's going move how you want

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.920 
the softbox it's going move how you want
your<00:05:38.950> light<00:05:39.160> to<00:05:39.310> be<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.610> typically<00:05:40.060> if<00:05:40.570> I'm

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
your light to be and typically if I'm

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.350 
your light to be and typically if I'm
making<00:05:41.229> like<00:05:41.260> something<00:05:42.220> that<00:05:42.790> needs<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.210> have

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
making like something that needs to have

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.060 
making like something that needs to have
like<00:05:43.570> good<00:05:43.720> lighting<00:05:43.930> I'll<00:05:44.350> put<00:05:44.620> a<00:05:44.650> softbox

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
like good lighting I'll put a softbox

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.270 
like good lighting I'll put a softbox
over<00:05:45.370> here<00:05:45.780> copy<00:05:46.780> and<00:05:46.990> paste<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.410> I'll<00:05:47.979> put

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
over here copy and paste it I'll put

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.890 
over here copy and paste it I'll put
another<00:05:48.460> soft<00:05:48.760> box<00:05:49.350> over<00:05:50.350> here<00:05:51.690> doesn't<00:05:52.690> need

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
another soft box over here doesn't need

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.060 
another soft box over here doesn't need
to<00:05:52.960> be<00:05:53.050> perfect<00:05:53.080> right<00:05:53.470> now<00:05:53.530> because<00:05:53.800> I'm<00:05:53.860> just

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
to be perfect right now because I'm just

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.110 
to be perfect right now because I'm just
showing<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.340> guys<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:58.510> yeah<00:05:58.660> and<00:05:58.900> then<00:05:59.500> a<00:06:00.120> lot

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
showing you guys so yeah and then a lot

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.790 
showing you guys so yeah and then a lot
of<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.270> times<00:06:01.450> i<00:06:01.600> put<00:06:01.750> a<00:06:01.780> softbox<00:06:02.200> above<00:06:02.620> it<00:06:02.710> as

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
of the times i put a softbox above it as

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.550 
of the times i put a softbox above it as
well<00:06:03.180> just<00:06:04.180> for<00:06:04.360> extremely<00:06:04.990> good<00:06:05.350> lighting

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
well just for extremely good lighting

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.030 
well just for extremely good lighting
that's<00:06:06.370> how<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:06.550> need<00:06:06.729> to<00:06:06.789> do<00:06:06.910> it

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
that's how you need to do it

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.610 
that's how you need to do it
90<00:06:09.910> oh<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.940> 90<00:06:12.940> okay<00:06:13.900> there<00:06:14.140> we<00:06:14.200> go<00:06:14.230> and

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
90 oh and 90 okay there we go and

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.010 
90 oh and 90 okay there we go and
then<00:06:15.130> just<00:06:15.340> bring<00:06:15.790> that<00:06:15.910> like<00:06:16.450> right<00:06:16.810> above

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
then just bring that like right above

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.430 
then just bring that like right above
that<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.440> then<00:06:18.220> um<00:06:18.610> this<00:06:19.240> is<00:06:19.930> really<00:06:20.200> rough

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
that and then um this is really rough

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.120 
that and then um this is really rough
also<00:06:20.950> so<00:06:21.310> keep<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.150> in<00:06:22.330> mind<00:06:22.450> guys<00:06:22.750> um<00:06:23.130> we

also so keep that in mind guys um we
asked<00:06:24.370> it<00:06:24.430> now<00:06:24.580> let's<00:06:24.910> just<00:06:25.060> show<00:06:25.960> this<00:06:26.170> at

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
asked it now let's just show this at

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.400 
asked it now let's just show this at
