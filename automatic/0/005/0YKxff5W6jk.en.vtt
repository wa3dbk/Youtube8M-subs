look<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.359> something<00:00:18.960> we've<00:00:19.080> already

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
look at it something we've already

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.740 
look at it something we've already
written<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.650> something<00:00:20.160> we'll<00:00:20.400> probably<00:00:20.750> be

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
written up something we'll probably be

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
written up something we'll probably be
reviewing<00:00:22.230> before<00:00:22.410> too<00:00:22.859> long<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.420> we'll

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
reviewing before too long so now we'll

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.820 
reviewing before too long so now we'll
just<00:00:24.720> take<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:25.019> initial<00:00:25.380> look<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
just take an initial look at the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.630 
just take an initial look at the
hardware<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
hardware and a little bit of the the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.510 
hardware and a little bit of the the
operating<00:00:30.090> system<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:32.040> off<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.369> on

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
operating system so first off it's on

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.590 
operating system so first off it's on
the<00:00:32.940> stand

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the stand

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.250 
the stand
this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.739> sort<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> folding<00:00:36.660> stand<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this is the sort of folding stand that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.020 
this is the sort of folding stand that
we've<00:00:37.380> seen<00:00:37.620> before<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> believe<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> Nook

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
we've seen before I believe that Nook

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
we've seen before I believe that Nook
had<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.530> Kindle<00:00:41.010> Fire<00:00:41.540> HDX<00:00:42.540> has<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
had it now the Kindle Fire HDX has it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.470 
had it now the Kindle Fire HDX has it
and<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.309> removable<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
and this is actually removable if you

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.830 
and this is actually removable if you
take<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:50.840> slightly

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
take it out there it's slightly

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.500 
take it out there it's slightly
magnetized<00:00:52.469> within<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> base<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.329> can't

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
magnetized within the base you can't

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
magnetized within the base you can't
tell<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.690> looking<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.559> when<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tell from looking at it but when you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.760 
tell from looking at it but when you
attach<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.079> definitely<00:00:58.230> feel<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
attach it you could definitely feel it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.270 
attach it you could definitely feel it
and<00:00:59.539> then<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.199> also<00:01:01.320> magnetized<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then it's also magnetized on the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
and then it's also magnetized on the
bottom<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:04.019> piece<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:04.530> sort<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.769> slap

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
bottom so this piece will sort of slap

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
bottom so this piece will sort of slap
into<00:01:05.700> place<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.700> power<00:01:08.880> button<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.420> over

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
into place the the power button is over

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.679 
into place the the power button is over
here<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.890> volume<00:01:11.220> rocker<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.420> come

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
here and the volume rocker so they come

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.789 
here and the volume rocker so they come
right<00:01:12.960> through<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> they're<00:01:13.470> easy<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> use

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
right through and they're easy to use

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
right through and they're easy to use
when<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> case<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
when the case is on when you want to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
when the case is on when you want to
stand<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:16.049> you're<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.159> gonna<00:01:17.280> fold<00:01:17.729> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
stand it up you're just gonna fold this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.820 
stand it up you're just gonna fold this
origami<00:01:19.460> structure<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.900> place

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
origami structure in place

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.539 
origami structure in place
I<00:01:22.860> always<00:01:23.580> forget<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.090> always<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> wrong

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
I always forget I always get it wrong

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
fire hardware so far only losing focus

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.499 
fire hardware so far only losing focus
there<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> go
