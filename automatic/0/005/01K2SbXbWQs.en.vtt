00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello good kids we are here a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.850
 new video is saying a pocket 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.440
 of the new mobile that I just received that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.360
 well I've put before by twitter if 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.250
 you want to see it and that and it has had enough 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.929
 support so I do not have here at the moment 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 in the box not yet the open I have some 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.710
 incredible desire to open it is the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.480
 samsung galaxy ls 16 in that good almost 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.510
 it falls out of the box because it comes out 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 here below but that I say to you makes a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.250
 little bit what happened to me and all that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.929
 because it has cost me a lot of 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.110
 find it is in four colors is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.600
 in gold in white green and black as well 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.219
 navy blue and I went then the other day 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 thinking he was in all the stores 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
 and that and there was only the green and I say 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 I bought it so green did not 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 it ended then they wanted it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.079
 white in the beginning because I always 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.499
 they liked the white mobiles 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.230
 so we went to several stores and 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:58.109
 it was in gold exposed in one of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.429
 and I liked it so much that I forgot 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.040
 I only had the image of the white 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.409
 eternal gold and then I called day 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.110
 next to about 50 stores at least 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.539
 I was exhausted everywhere and I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.119
 I gave up because I said already when 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.090
 is available then on the page and that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.369
 because I was exhausted too, because 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.979
 we'll see if I ask and that and in the end 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.140
 because yesterday I called a store called by 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.030
 call and yes I had it they had it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.459
 available only one model remained 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 color are golden that is what I have 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:35.310
 caught and I said to send it to me and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.280
 So I asked and just as it has me 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.289
 arrived today that is between 64 gigas this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 mobile because it has no space to 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.100
 microsd cards then yes it's worth the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 grief with people was a little bit more but 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 Anyway, I would have caught him from 32 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.840
 and if it gets to be there are three models 32 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.890
 64 and 128 if they arrive from 32 then also what 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.780
 would have 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.600
 I have also asked, even if you can not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.790
 put the micro sd but I will not 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.830
 change the camera and that and so ya ya 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.810
 I teach that I have a desire to open it 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.900
 since I can not see him there in the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.610
 Well, come on, let's see 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.610
 now the thing I have to remove it 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.319
 to show a little 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.750
 fuck I am very nervous 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.750
 it's worth breaking it now 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.800
 but 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.180
 It's worth, it's worth all the sticker 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.129
 stickers jeans 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.329
 Now I'm going to remove it because if I do not 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.329
 you will see this well 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.790
 and they are protected 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.319
 and there she is, I have had to do 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.390
 a cut because my girlfriend inadvertently 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.640
 I was recording to take breath I hope 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.709
 that look good because they were a boxing 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.620
 while I opened it and that yes no I can not 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.299
 re-record but good I'll show you 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.810
 a little bit what is configured and that already 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.180
 that I could see it for the moment takes the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.609
 background and all that from the previous mobile that 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.590
 had everything been set up by putting it 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.120
 the google account and all that but 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.120
 well the front camera is 5 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.609
 megapixels the back of 16 is recorded to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.000
 4k and I'll try to upload a video if 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.120
 that and so you also see how it looked 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.879
 4k because I have not seen either 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.829
 recorded video with a mobile of these but 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.620
 good the simple ones and the camera and that you 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.359
 I'll put some picture so you can see how 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.209
 he does them for the time being he has the hdr 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.950
 This time around here diaz something I 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.959
 it seems that it is in the good menu I will put you 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.130
 that some image so you can see how it 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.950
 as 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.100
 I do not know how it is that I have no idea how 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.900
 the menu comes out this when in theory 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.210
 when you run your finger over here because in the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.670
 but I will investigate because I do not have 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.340
 no idea but good are 3 gb of ram 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.490
 dir of 4 on top that are faster and 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.770
 So it has an opta core processor that 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:15.840
 are 8 cores are 4 of 2.1 and 4 of 1.5 to 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.880
 see so you can see so fast 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.730
 that goes and that the gallery there are no photos yet 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.400
 but he has the same thing about 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.310
 fingerprint this is the detector the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.800
 good camera opens pretty fast 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.010
 there he is recording at the moment that 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.330
 I give it to you to record but that's 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.310
 I will put some image and that so that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.190
 see how it looks in a video and go up 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.720
 later on if that so you can see the 4k 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.720
 that to see if it records well 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.229
 but pretty fast is double what 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.919
 that I had on the previous mobile that was 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.360
 the lg esteem 3 has already been installed 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.129
 applications and everything I had to see 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.129
 if I have any 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.300
 OK 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.120
 let's put a video I do not know if what 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.639
 let's set it up and all good for 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.389
 that you could see a little bit how quickly 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.389
 go and all that and nothing I hope that I have 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.210
 I'm going to leave it there so that it 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.669
 see well but that when you give it gives you 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.039
 full light the golden one seems to be 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.180
 different yes it changes a little but 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.530
 It's really cool the truth that has 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.690
 very much liked the camera so 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.780
 excels a little bit that is the only thing that 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.880
 yes I see that it could have been 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.270
 a little better is not if it becomes 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.880
 flat protruding there is a tad but barely 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.830
 it shows when he supports it whether or not it is 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.750
 it is not noticeable that it stands out much 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.610
 but the truth is true that has 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.530
 liked it very much so I do not expect anything 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.530
 what you liked and until next time
