00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
style that SK so familiar with I think

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.230 
style that SK so familiar with I think
Alliance<00:00:19.350> didn't<00:00:19.859> play<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.760> win<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:20.939> plate

not<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.600> lose<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> when<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.340> remember<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
not to lose and when I remember like the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.880 
not to lose and when I remember like the
game<00:00:24.570> by<00:00:24.750> itself<00:00:24.960> before<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.769> all

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
game by itself before because it's all

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.450 
game by itself before because it's all
sanded<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.289> don't<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.500> had<00:00:28.680> no

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
sanded and like I don't know if I had no

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.060 
sanded and like I don't know if I had no
presence<00:00:29.880> anywhere<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.800> way<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
presence anywhere and with the way the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.590 
presence anywhere and with the way the
game<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.610> playing<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.149> because<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
game was playing like because you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
game was playing like because you
couldn't<00:00:33.780> gak<00:00:33.989> talk<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.380> knew<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.370> lanes

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
couldn't gak talk we knew that the lanes

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970 
couldn't gak talk we knew that the lanes
that<00:00:35.790> should<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.930> can't<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.530> both<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that should get can't was like both and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
that should get can't was like both and
meat<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.370> could<00:00:38.850> understand<00:00:39.180> from<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
meat and we could understand from the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.860 
meat and we could understand from the
movements<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.680> fresh<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:42.149> listen

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
movements of like fresh or like listen

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
movements of like fresh or like listen
but<00:00:43.290> we're<00:00:43.890> where<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.219> should<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.670> been<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but we're where we should have been and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.080 
but we're where we should have been and
so<00:00:45.300> prevented<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.989> ability<00:00:46.410> hit<00:00:47.090> advances

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
so prevented that ability hit advances

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.279 
so prevented that ability hit advances
build<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.390> already<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> just

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
build up already and so we just

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
build up already and so we just
capitalized<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.039> kept<00:00:50.250> capitalizing

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
capitalized and we kept capitalizing

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
capitalized and we kept capitalizing
ideally<00:00:51.210> did<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.420> mistake<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.199> did<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
ideally did a mistake which they did and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
ideally did a mistake which they did and
so<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.309> snowballed<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:53.969> there

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so we just snowballed from there

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.299 
so we just snowballed from there
laughter<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:55.260> congratulations<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.190> was

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

the fact that this game sk played the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
the fact that this game sk played the
traditional<00:01:01.379> style<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.739> tend<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
aggressive in lane why is it you were

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310

losing streak hmm i honestly have no
idea<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> junglers<00:01:14.460> would

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
idea i think that the junglers would

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.289 
idea i think that the junglers would
face<00:01:14.760> were<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.590> yet<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
face were more yet more like know how to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
face were more yet more like know how to
call<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.780> map<00:01:18.960> pressure<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.890> hit

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
call more map pressure and like we hit

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.850 
call more map pressure and like we hit
more<00:01:20.159> movement<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:21.380> gave<00:01:22.380> impression

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
more movement they just gave impression

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.260 
more movement they just gave impression
but<00:01:22.950> even<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.430> gangs<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:24.090> not

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
but even if the gangs were not

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.820 
but even if the gangs were not
successful<00:01:24.750> began<00:01:25.140> pressure<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
successful began pressure that the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.140 
successful began pressure that the
moment<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> mistake<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:26.909> will<00:01:27.030> be

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
moment you do a mistake but will be

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
moment you do a mistake but will be
there<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.200> overextend<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.130> die

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
there but you overextend you will die

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
there but you overextend you will die
with<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> dragon<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.540> clock<00:01:30.840> towers<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
with a dragon with a clock towers you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
with a dragon with a clock towers you
are<00:01:31.500> gone<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> game<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:32.970> think

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
are gone from the game and I don't think

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
are gone from the game and I don't think
shook<00:01:33.360> had<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> good<00:01:33.750> game<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.770> made<00:01:35.040> our

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
shook had a good game so it made our

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.380 
shook had a good game so it made our
lives<00:01:35.310> better<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:36.060> three<00:01:36.240> lanes

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
lives better because all three lanes

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
lives better because all three lanes
were<00:01:36.570> winning<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.350> well<00:01:37.979> definitely<00:01:38.250> worked

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
were winning so well definitely worked

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.880 
were winning so well definitely worked

be<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:10.050> are<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.649> people<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.430> let<00:02:11.640> ourselves

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
be we are the people but let ourselves

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.309

down<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> boom

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
down and boom

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.440 
down and boom
like<00:02:13.379> other<00:02:13.709> people<00:02:14.249> sad<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.969> really<00:02:15.359> think

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
like other people sad so I really think

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.020 
like other people sad so I really think
that<00:02:15.569> if<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.079> work<00:02:16.319> again<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:17.189> again<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.609> we

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that if you work again not again if we

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.089 
that if you work again not again if we
can<00:02:18.719> combine<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.200> personalities<00:02:19.739> we<00:02:19.920> have

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
can combine the personalities we have

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.750 
can combine the personalities we have
the<00:02:20.579> team<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.969> if<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.329> can<00:02:21.510> combine<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.769> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the team and if we can combine like the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.339 
the team and if we can combine like the
psychology<00:02:24.359> or<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.659> mindset<00:02:24.959> we<00:02:25.079> said<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
psychology or the mindset we said that

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.020 
psychology or the mindset we said that
we<00:02:25.739> are<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.889> best<00:02:26.069> diamond<00:02:26.249> hill<00:02:26.549> best<00:02:26.790> Paris

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
we are the best diamond hill best Paris

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
we are the best diamond hill best Paris
and<00:02:27.150> we'll<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:27.540> not<00:02:27.900> prove<00:02:28.139> it<00:02:28.230> every<00:02:28.349> time

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and we'll just not prove it every time

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.709 
and we'll just not prove it every time
but<00:02:28.739> we<00:02:28.859> just<00:02:28.980> displayed<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.269> game<00:02:30.450> people

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
but we just displayed in the game people

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.860 
but we just displayed in the game people
will<00:02:30.989> fear<00:02:31.230> us<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.069> think<00:02:32.189> that<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.870> we

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
will fear us and so I think that if we

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.140 
will fear us and so I think that if we
do<00:02:34.409> it<00:02:34.500> properly<00:02:34.799> if<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:35.189> are<00:02:35.280> grownups<00:02:35.519> we'll

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
do it properly if we are grownups we'll

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.119 
do it properly if we are grownups we'll
