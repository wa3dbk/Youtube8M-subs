00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.160
 This procedure is used to unlock the cell phone when we have lost the code 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.780
 of access, the unlock pattern and also the account and password of the configuration 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.860
 initial. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.200
 I turn off the computer and make sure there is enough battery power 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 it is recommended to remove the sd memory as this procedure will erase many of the data from the phone 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.420
 I will start the procedure 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.400
 pressing the volume below 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.160
 The power button and the middle button of the phone at the same time 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.420
 first turn on the LG logo 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.440
 After a few seconds the Android robot will appear 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.600
 Once it appears we release the buttons 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 and we let 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.040
 the operating system loads on the computer 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.880
 Again the logo appears 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.230
 and that's where the logo of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 the telephone company 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.100
 Once the operating system finishes loading 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 the team will send us to the configuration page 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 which is like when 

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:32.047
 the equipment is newly purchased 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 There we are going to introduce 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.480
 Account data 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.180
 Whether it's an existing account or a new one 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.460
 for that we must 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 have access to a data network 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.080
 either by means of mobile network or WIFI 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 Here I will click on next and I will 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.480
 set up with a gmail account the team 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 for this I have to connect to a WIFI first 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.400
 for which select the WIFI of which I know the counter 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.420
 I enter the password 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.920
 and from there 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.060
 I start to configure 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.909
 the Google account 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.860
 To set up my computer with an existing gmail account 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.020
 I just have to enter the email data and password 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.020
 Well, in the next steps it's just going fill the fields 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.100
 with our necessary data 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.800
 or else we can also 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.500
 jump them and do it later 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 almost to end he asks me 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.860
 if I want to activate the location feature 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.986
 this is according to personal criteria 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.740
 From here I'm going to press Next 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.280
 how far I get a notice that the phone has been configured 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.160
 and this means that the phone is ready to be used 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.000
