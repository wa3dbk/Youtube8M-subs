organic farmers simply because right now
that's<00:00:38.399> those<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> farmers<00:00:39.360> who<00:00:39.510> are

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that's those are the farmers who are

nitrogen supplies as nitrogen prices go
up<00:00:45.300> we're<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.780> need<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.260> turn<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> some<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
up we're gonna need to turn to some of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.229 
up we're gonna need to turn to some of
these<00:00:46.860> alternative<00:00:47.399> processes<00:00:47.760> such<00:00:48.090> as

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
these alternative processes such as

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.479 
these alternative processes such as
nitrogen<00:00:48.570> fixation<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.949> that<00:00:50.070> happens

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
nitrogen fixation and when that happens

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.680 
nitrogen fixation and when that happens
we<00:00:50.789> need<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.090> able<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> hit<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> ground

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
we need to be able to hit the ground

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
we need to be able to hit the ground
running<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.170> can't<00:00:52.410> say<00:00:52.649> okay<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.190> we're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
running we can't say okay now we're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.099 
running we can't say okay now we're
gonna<00:00:53.399> start<00:00:53.699> doing<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> research<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.809> really

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
gonna start doing the research we really

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.380 
gonna start doing the research we really
want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.879> take

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
want to get to know how when you take

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
want to get to know how when you take
back<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> bacterial<00:00:58.320> strain<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> bacteria<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
back a bacterial strain of bacteria and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
back a bacterial strain of bacteria and
you<00:00:59.609> look<00:00:59.789> at<00:00:59.879> its<00:01:00.000> DNA<00:01:00.480> how<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> differ

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
you look at its DNA how does it differ

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
you look at its DNA how does it differ
from<00:01:01.500> other<00:01:01.890> strains<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.430> bacteria<00:01:02.519> because

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
from other strains of bacteria because

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
from other strains of bacteria because
you<00:01:03.269> can<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.570> some<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.230> very<00:01:04.260> high

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you can have some that are very high

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.110 
you can have some that are very high
performers<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.550> fix<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> lot<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
performers and they fix a lot of

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.630 
performers and they fix a lot of
nitrogen<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.230> others<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
nitrogen and you can have others that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
nitrogen and you can have others that
don't<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.480> a<00:01:09.510> heck<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.410> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
don't really do a heck of a lot for the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.160 
don't really do a heck of a lot for the
plant<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.880> mind<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.690> really<00:01:12.870> help

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
plant in my mind what would really help

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
plant in my mind what would really help
the<00:01:13.470> farmers<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.160> trying<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> understand<00:01:15.120> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
tools they can use as farmers to help

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.140 
tools they can use as farmers to help
increase<00:01:18.950> nutrient<00:01:19.950> nutrient<00:01:20.880> supply<00:01:21.090> to

increase nutrient nutrient supply to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.180 
increase nutrient nutrient supply to
their<00:01:21.390> crop<00:01:21.570> plants<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.410> try<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> figure<00:01:22.950> out

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
their crop plants so try to figure out

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.240 
their crop plants so try to figure out
how<00:01:23.510> how<00:01:24.510> much<00:01:24.660> nitrogen<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.230> supplied<00:01:25.560> when

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
how how much nitrogen is supplied when

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.210 
how how much nitrogen is supplied when
they<00:01:26.370> put<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.940> legume<00:01:27.660> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.870> soil<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> let<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
they put a legume in the soil and let it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.820 
they put a legume in the soil and let it
decompose<00:01:29.370> how<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:31.020> released<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.710> it's

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
decompose how that is released when it's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.830 
decompose how that is released when it's
released<00:01:32.190> how<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.300> more<00:01:33.330> nitrogen

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
released how we can get more nitrogen

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.960 
released how we can get more nitrogen
into<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> legume<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.370> enhancing<00:01:35.730> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
into the legume by enhancing the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
into the legume by enhancing the
fixation<00:01:36.870> ability<00:01:37.410> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> microbes<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.100> all

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
fixation ability of the microbes so all

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.560 
fixation ability of the microbes so all
these<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.670> pieces<00:01:38.940> will<00:01:39.870> help<00:01:40.140> us<00:01:41.480> be<00:01:42.480> able

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
these little pieces will help us be able

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.910 
these little pieces will help us be able
to<00:01:42.690> help<00:01:42.840> farmers<00:01:43.290> develop<00:01:43.740> their<00:01:43.890> own

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
to help farmers develop their own

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
to help farmers develop their own
research<00:01:44.280> their<00:01:44.580> own<00:01:44.670> experimentation<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
research their own experimentation so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.880 
research their own experimentation so
they<00:01:45.660> don't<00:01:45.810> need<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.990> rely<00:01:46.230> on<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.410> recipes

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
they don't need to rely on the recipes

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.180

they<00:01:47.400> can<00:01:47.580> say<00:01:47.760> oh<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.620> I<00:01:49.800> can

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
they can say oh I know that if I can

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.000 
they can say oh I know that if I can
calculate<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:51.200> square<00:01:52.200> meter<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.590> Legian

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
calculate a square meter of Legian

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.460 
calculate a square meter of Legian
biomass<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.270> calculate<00:01:54.420> how<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.290> I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
biomass and I can calculate how much I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.320 
biomass and I can calculate how much I
have<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.040> much<00:01:56.190> nitrogen<00:01:56.400> is<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:56.970> that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
have and how much nitrogen is in that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.720 
have and how much nitrogen is in that
square<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:58.050> can<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.740> figure<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.100> my<00:01:59.550> whole

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
square I can then figure out my whole

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.790 
square I can then figure out my whole
field<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.480> much<00:02:00.660> nitrogen<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:01.230> being<00:02:01.440> added

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
field how much nitrogen is being added

soil and so those are the kinds of
things<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.210> really<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> give<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.860> farmers

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220

in terms of having them understand how
they<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.020> control<00:02:10.380> their<00:02:10.619> own<00:02:10.649> these<00:02:11.370> are

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
they can control their own these are

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.590 
they can control their own these are
their<00:02:11.730> biological<00:02:12.210> process
