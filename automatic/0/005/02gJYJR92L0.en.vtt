00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
complete disaster with my car the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.429 
complete disaster with my car the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.330 
transmissions fine it's not that aspect
but<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.050> axle<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.260> try<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> passenger

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
but the axle on the try on the passenger

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
but the axle on the try on the passenger
side<00:00:23.550> went<00:00:23.820> bad<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> CV<00:00:24.660> axle<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.170> drives

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
side went bad to the CV axle that drives

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.099 
side went bad to the CV axle that drives
the<00:00:25.560> car<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.039> then<00:00:26.430> after<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> nail<00:00:27.750> flew

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the car and then after that a nail flew

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.919 
the car and then after that a nail flew
into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> CB<00:00:28.890> axle<00:00:29.279> seal<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.539> output

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
into the CB axle seal or the output

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.280 
into the CB axle seal or the output
shaft<00:00:31.109> seal<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.570> my<00:00:33.570> transmission<00:00:34.140> was

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
shaft seal and my transmission was

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.900 
shaft seal and my transmission was
leaking<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.040> wasn't<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:35.340> fun<00:00:35.730> but

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
leaking so that wasn't very fun but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.190 
leaking so that wasn't very fun but
here's<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> want<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> show<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.960> oh

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
here's what I want to show you now oh
and<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.710> top<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.070> pet<00:00:38.399> boys<00:00:38.610> didn't

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and on top of that pet boys didn't

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
and on top of that pet boys didn't
fasten<00:00:39.420> my<00:00:39.540> negative<00:00:39.899> battery<00:00:40.050> cables<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.800> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
fasten my negative battery cables so I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
fasten my negative battery cables so I
basically<00:00:41.070> almost<00:00:41.760> fried<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.149> alternator<00:00:42.629> in

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
basically almost fried my alternator in

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.490 
basically almost fried my alternator in
my<00:00:42.930> car<00:00:43.200> computer<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:44.640> wasn't<00:00:44.940> fun<00:00:45.090> either

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
my car computer that wasn't fun either

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
my car computer that wasn't fun either
so<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> show<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.539> idles

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so this is what I want to show you idles

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.529 
so this is what I want to show you idles
pretty<00:00:48.809> low<00:00:49.160> for<00:00:50.160> being<00:00:50.399> cold<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.059> started

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
pretty low for being cold I just started

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
pretty low for being cold I just started
the<00:00:51.629> car<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the car as you can see and I'm going to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.389 
the car as you can see and I'm going to
shift<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.449> reverse<00:00:54.980> goes<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> little

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
shift it into reverse goes up a little

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
shift it into reverse goes up a little
bit<00:00:56.579> goes<00:00:57.030> into<00:00:57.270> reverse<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.809> obviously<00:00:58.109> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
bit goes into reverse so obviously it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.680 
bit goes into reverse so obviously it's
going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.739> bit<00:00:58.829> lower<00:00:59.039> because

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
going to be a little bit lower because

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.009 
going to be a little bit lower because
well<00:01:01.399> in<00:01:02.399> gear<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> always<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.390> lower<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.870> some

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
well in gear it always is lower for some

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
well in gear it always is lower for some
apparent<00:01:04.260> reason<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:05.220> mom's<00:01:05.430> does<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> too<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
apparent reason my mom's does it too so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.140 
apparent reason my mom's does it too so
I'm<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.450> worried<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.670> question

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
I'm not really worried but my question

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
I'm not really worried but my question
is<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:10.170> come<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> let<00:01:11.010> off<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> gas<00:01:11.460> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is is how come when I let off the gas in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
is is how come when I let off the gas in
the<00:01:11.729> car<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> cold<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> RPMs<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the car is cold the RPMs go to a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.480 
the car is cold the RPMs go to a
ridiculously<00:01:14.070> low<00:01:14.430> setting<00:01:16.250> right<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
ridiculously low setting right now I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.770 
ridiculously low setting right now I
haven't<00:01:17.880> even<00:01:17.939> touched<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> gas<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.689> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
haven't even touched the gas so it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
haven't even touched the gas so it's
going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> continue<00:01:19.350> moving<00:01:19.470> forward<00:01:19.650> pretty

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
going to continue moving forward pretty

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.830 
going to continue moving forward pretty
quickly<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.820> fact<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.360> gas<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.720> already

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
quickly in fact the gas is already

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
quickly in fact the gas is already
engaged<00:01:22.320> since<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.710> adjusted<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> idle<00:01:25.880> I'm

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
engaged since I adjusted the idle I'm

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.679 
engaged since I adjusted the idle I'm
going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> pull<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> gate<00:01:28.080> here

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.660 

and<00:01:33.289> you<00:01:33.350> see<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:33.799> still<00:01:34.100> pretty<00:01:34.369> high<00:01:34.640> for

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and you see it's still pretty high for

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.789 
and you see it's still pretty high for
being<00:01:35.149> cold<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:36.200> hasn't<00:01:36.469> even<00:01:36.530> started

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
being cold and it hasn't even started

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.919 
being cold and it hasn't even started
warming<00:01:37.189> up<00:01:37.280> yet<00:01:37.549> but<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.359> one<00:01:38.509> thing<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:38.749> want

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
warming up yet but the one thing I want

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.630 
warming up yet but the one thing I want
to<00:01:38.990> show<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.469> now<00:01:39.619> now<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.009> have<00:01:40.189> my<00:01:40.280> foot<00:01:40.490> on

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
to show you is now now I have my foot on

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.419 
to show you is now now I have my foot on
the<00:01:40.759> gas<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.200> shifted<00:01:42.679> fine<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.340> it's

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
the gas so it shifted fine and it's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.730 
the gas so it shifted fine and it's
shifting<00:01:43.640> perfectly<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:44.659> my<00:01:44.750> question<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.380> is

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
shifting perfectly but my question is is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.800 
shifting perfectly but my question is is
how<00:01:45.950> come<00:01:46.219> as<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.579> car<00:01:46.819> starts<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.240> warm<00:01:47.539> up

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
how come as the car starts to warm up

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.599 
how come as the car starts to warm up
and<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.049> idle<00:01:48.319> turn<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.890> fast<00:01:49.130> idle<00:01:49.340> turns

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
and the idle turn the fast idle turns

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.130 
and the idle turn the fast idle turns
off<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:50.619> when<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.130> idle<00:01:52.969> becomes<00:01:53.689> really<00:01:53.840> low

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
off is when the idle becomes really low

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.039 
off is when the idle becomes really low
watch<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:55.789> doesn't<00:01:56.090> go<00:01:56.179> into<00:01:56.359> forth<00:01:56.780> and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
watch so it doesn't go into forth and

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.449 
watch so it doesn't go into forth and
then<00:01:58.329> see<00:01:59.329> it<00:01:59.509> drops<00:01:59.840> down<00:01:59.959> really<00:02:00.859> low<00:02:01.130> and

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
then see it drops down really low and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.219 
then see it drops down really low and
then<00:02:01.670> that's<00:02:01.969> my<00:02:02.060> question<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.780> why<00:02:02.929> does<00:02:03.109> it

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
then that's my question is why does it

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.679 
then that's my question is why does it
do<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.759> I'm<00:02:04.759> going<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:04.939> try<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.119> get<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.569> go

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
do that I'm going to try to get it to go

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.209 
do that I'm going to try to get it to go
into<00:02:05.929> fourth<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.530> usually<00:02:06.799> doesn't<00:02:06.950> shift

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
into fourth it usually doesn't shift

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.819 
into fourth it usually doesn't shift
into<00:02:07.429> fourth<00:02:07.869> pretty<00:02:08.869> quickly<00:02:09.289> because

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
into fourth pretty quickly because

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.830 
into fourth pretty quickly because
obviously<00:02:10.190> when<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.670> car<00:02:10.849> is<00:02:11.000> cold<00:02:11.239> okay

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
obviously when the car is cold okay

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.069 
obviously when the car is cold okay
sometimes<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.440> lockout<00:02:12.769> overdrive<00:02:13.959> until<00:02:14.959> it

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
sometimes the lockout overdrive until it

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.559 
sometimes the lockout overdrive until it
because<00:02:15.769> they<00:02:15.860> take<00:02:16.040> longer<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.370> shift<00:02:16.670> so

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
because they take longer to shift so

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.449 
because they take longer to shift so
that's<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:17.989> second<00:02:18.579> now<00:02:19.610> Tier<00:02:20.120> three<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that's for a second now Tier three and

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.680 
that's for a second now Tier three and
then<00:02:22.459> we're<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:22.910> go<00:02:23.030> into<00:02:23.209> gear<00:02:23.329> for<00:02:23.569> now

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
then we're going to go into gear for now

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.150 
then we're going to go into gear for now
I<00:02:23.780> want<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.019> show<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.260> what's<00:02:24.739> going<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.099> here

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
I want to show you what's going on here

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.210 
I want to show you what's going on here
is<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.760> drops<00:02:26.000> down<00:02:26.090> really<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.840> lot<00:02:27.220> see

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
is that it drops down really a lot see

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.610 
is that it drops down really a lot see
that<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:28.879> it<00:02:29.000> starts<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:30.140> here

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
that and then it starts to like here

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.080 
that and then it starts to like here
look<00:02:30.739> at<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.099> starts<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.459> float<00:02:31.730> around<00:02:31.849> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
look at it it starts to float around a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.589 
look at it it starts to float around a
little<00:02:32.209> bit<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:34.970> stays<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:35.420> now

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
little bit and it just stays there now

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.509 
little bit and it just stays there now
the<00:02:35.660> transmission<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.799> still<00:02:37.010> slowing<00:02:37.280> down

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
the transmission is still slowing down

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.490 
the transmission is still slowing down
the<00:02:37.700> car<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.180> my<00:02:38.269> question<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.049> why<00:02:39.319> does

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
the car but my question is is why does

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.550 
the car but my question is is why does
it<00:02:40.000> why<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.269> trying<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.510> fluctuate<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.049> RPM

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
it why is it trying to fluctuate the RPM

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.280 
it why is it trying to fluctuate the RPM
so<00:02:42.799> much<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.000> that's<00:02:44.180> my<00:02:44.420> question<00:02:44.660> here<00:02:45.109> is<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
so much so that's my question here is a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.690 
so much so that's my question here is a
is<00:02:46.069> why<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.670> doing<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:46.970> because<00:02:48.549> you<00:02:49.549> know

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
is why is it doing that because you know

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.949 
is why is it doing that because you know
it's<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.209> never<00:02:50.419> done<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.780> before<00:02:51.200> and

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
it's just never done that before and

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.030 
it's just never done that before and
what<00:02:53.959> it's<00:02:54.079> telling<00:02:54.260> me<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.769> it's<00:02:54.889> not

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
what it's telling me is that it's not

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.890 
what it's telling me is that it's not
the<00:02:55.160> transmission<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.849> if<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.329> because<00:02:56.780> it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the transmission is if is because it's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.589 
the transmission is if is because it's
still<00:02:57.079> it's<00:02:57.349> down<00:02:57.859> shifting<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:59.060> see<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.389> it

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
still it's down shifting you see that it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.690 
still it's down shifting you see that it
down<00:02:59.810> shifted<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.560> it's<00:03:01.099> going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> downshift

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
down shifted and it's going to downshift

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.280 
down shifted and it's going to downshift
into<00:03:01.849> first<00:03:02.180> two<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.690> can<00:03:02.870> feel<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.169> in

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
into first two because I can feel it in

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.259 
into first two because I can feel it in
the<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.769> brake<00:03:03.980> pedal<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.030> I'm<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:05.209> to

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
the in the brake pedal so I'm going to

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.759 
the in the brake pedal so I'm going to
do<00:03:05.359> this<00:03:05.450> again<00:03:05.599> I'm<00:03:05.750> gonna<00:03:05.840> try<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.019> get<00:03:06.169> to<00:03:06.319> 50

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
do this again I'm gonna try to get to 50

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.559 
do this again I'm gonna try to get to 50
now

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.330 

now<00:03:11.110> remember<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.530> transmission<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
now remember the transmission and the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.309 
now remember the transmission and the
engine<00:03:12.370> are<00:03:12.730> still<00:03:13.000> cold<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:13.719> I'm<00:03:13.840> not<00:03:13.989> rubbing

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
engine are still cold so I'm not rubbing

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.240 
engine are still cold so I'm not rubbing
it<00:03:14.409> really<00:03:14.709> really<00:03:14.920> high

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.510 

now<00:03:18.790> I'm<00:03:18.910> at<00:03:19.030> 45<00:03:19.360> going<00:03:20.140> up<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.350> 50<00:03:20.740> and<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
now I'm at 45 going up to 50 and the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.920 
now I'm at 45 going up to 50 and the
torque<00:03:21.730> converter<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.450> said<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.780> doesn't

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
torque converter like I said it doesn't

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.540 
torque converter like I said it doesn't
lock<00:03:23.170> because<00:03:23.380> obviously<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.010> car<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.280> cold

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
lock because obviously the car is cold

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.270 
lock because obviously the car is cold
but<00:03:24.670> watch<00:03:24.910> when<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.330> let<00:03:25.510> off<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> gas<00:03:26.280> it

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
but watch when I let off the gas it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.190 
but watch when I let off the gas it
drops<00:03:27.640> down<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.970> rather<00:03:28.240> ridiculous<00:03:28.840> amount

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
drops down a rather ridiculous amount

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.710 
drops down a rather ridiculous amount
and<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:30.340> stays<00:03:30.730> down<00:03:31.000> there<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.570> doesn't

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
and it stays down there but it doesn't

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.570 
and it stays down there but it doesn't
pop<00:03:31.960> back<00:03:32.170> up<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.650> it's<00:03:32.830> telling<00:03:33.070> me<00:03:33.220> it's<00:03:33.430> not

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
pop back up so it's telling me it's not

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.460 
pop back up so it's telling me it's not
it's<00:03:33.820> it's<00:03:34.180> telling<00:03:34.630> me<00:03:34.660> basically<00:03:35.170> that

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
it's it's telling me basically that

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.520 
it's it's telling me basically that
either<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.040> fuel<00:03:36.280> system<00:03:36.550> or<00:03:37.080> it's<00:03:38.080> a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
either it's the fuel system or it's a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.550 
either it's the fuel system or it's a
vacuum<00:03:38.800> leak<00:03:39.160> somewhere<00:03:39.490> or<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.720> something

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
vacuum leak somewhere or it's something

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.230 
vacuum leak somewhere or it's something
along<00:03:41.770> that<00:03:41.800> sort<00:03:42.310> because<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.730> can't<00:03:43.000> be<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
along that sort because it can't be the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.210 
along that sort because it can't be the
transmission<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.990> just<00:03:44.170> can't<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.830> fluids

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
transmission it just can't the fluids

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.710 
transmission it just can't the fluids
find<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.730> fluid<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.150> pink

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
find the fluid is pink

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.220 
find the fluid is pink
Pinkus<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.800> be<00:03:47.980> really<00:03:48.670> really<00:03:48.910> pink<00:03:49.360> well

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
Pinkus can be really really pink well

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.710 
Pinkus can be really really pink well
it's<00:03:51.010> pink<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.459> red<00:03:51.640> sort<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.270> is<00:03:52.450> sort<00:03:52.660> of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
it's pink and red sort of is sort of

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.180 
it's pink and red sort of is sort of
deal<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.050> it's<00:03:53.200> telling<00:03:53.410> me<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.739> not<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
deal so it's telling me it's not the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.880 
deal so it's telling me it's not the
transmission<00:03:54.820> for<00:03:54.970> sure<00:03:55.320> now<00:03:56.320> if<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.560> keep<00:03:56.770> my

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
transmission for sure now if I keep my

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.620 
transmission for sure now if I keep my
foot<00:03:57.040> on<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.250> gas<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:57.850> it's<00:03:58.209> just<00:03:58.360> pretty

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
foot on the gas just it's just pretty

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.390 
foot on the gas just it's just pretty
normal<00:03:58.870> but<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.410> only<00:03:59.620> thing<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.310> my

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
normal but the only thing that my

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.250 
normal but the only thing that my
question<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.150> why<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.450> why<00:04:01.720> does<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.050> drop

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
question was is why is why does it drop

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.290 
question was is why is why does it drop
down<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.680> low<00:04:02.830> in<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.070> car<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.370> cold<00:04:03.580> now<00:04:04.239> you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
down so low in the car is cold now you

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.030 
down so low in the car is cold now you
see<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> car<00:04:04.810> starting<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.260> warm<00:04:05.470> up<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:05.860> it's

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
see the car starting to warm up so it's

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.610 
see the car starting to warm up so it's
not<00:04:06.160> going<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.430> be<00:04:06.520> it's<00:04:06.730> not<00:04:06.940> going<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.440> do<00:04:08.440> it

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
not going to be it's not going to do it

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.800 
not going to be it's not going to do it
it<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.550> still<00:04:09.880> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.120> unlock<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.570> torque

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
it is still going to unlock the torque

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.290 
it is still going to unlock the torque
converter<00:04:10.900> at<00:04:11.260> 50<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:12.580> some<00:04:12.730> reason<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.150> has

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
converter at 50 for some reason it has

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.750 
converter at 50 for some reason it has
always<00:04:13.570> done<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.110> but<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:15.459> know<00:04:15.550> I'm<00:04:15.640> not

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
always done that but you know I'm not

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.099 
always done that but you know I'm not
really<00:04:15.910> worried<00:04:16.239> about<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.660> it's<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:16.930> the

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
really worried about that it's just the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.780 
really worried about that it's just the
fact<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.350> I'm<00:04:17.500> wondering<00:04:17.650> why<00:04:17.950> my<00:04:18.100> rpms<00:04:18.549> drop

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
fact that I'm wondering why my rpms drop

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.620 
fact that I'm wondering why my rpms drop
so<00:04:19.000> low<00:04:19.030> when<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.359> let<00:04:19.480> off<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.720> gas

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
so low when I let off the gas

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:33.559 
so low when I let off the gas
you<00:04:22.630> better<00:04:22.840> not<00:04:23.020> pull<00:04:23.200> out<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.410> front<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.710> me

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.260 

okay<00:04:34.199> so<00:04:34.529> as<00:04:34.649> you<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.949> see<00:04:35.159> our<00:04:35.819> pants<00:04:36.179> are

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
okay so as you can see our pants are

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.629 
okay so as you can see our pants are
pretty<00:04:36.330> normal<00:04:36.719> now<00:04:36.839> they're<00:04:37.020> pretty<00:04:37.139> stable

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
pretty normal now they're pretty stable

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.919 
pretty normal now they're pretty stable
so<00:04:38.639> it's<00:04:38.819> kind<00:04:39.029> of<00:04:39.089> telling<00:04:39.389> me<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.719> car

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:39.929 
so it's kind of telling me that the car

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:41.629 
so it's kind of telling me that the car
needs<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.199> recover<00:04:40.529> itself<00:04:40.979> before<00:04:41.249> it<00:04:41.460> does

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
needs to recover itself before it does

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.429 
needs to recover itself before it does
anything<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.569> even<00:04:42.839> then<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.169> still<00:04:43.259> going

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
anything but even then it's still going

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.919 
anything but even then it's still going
to<00:04:43.499> drop<00:04:43.679> down<00:04:43.889> a<00:04:43.949> little<00:04:44.490> bit<00:04:44.899> until<00:04:45.899> I

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:45.929 
to drop down a little bit until I

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:50.329 
to drop down a little bit until I
actually<00:04:46.259> get<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.330> maybe<00:04:48.330> like<00:04:48.599> 45<00:04:49.229> which<00:04:50.129> I'm

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:50.339 
actually get to maybe like 45 which I'm

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:51.889 
actually get to maybe like 45 which I'm
going<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.580> show<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.789> in<00:04:51.089> just<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:51.689> couple

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:51.899 
going to show you in just a couple

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.779 
going to show you in just a couple
seconds<00:04:52.550> when<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.580> turn<00:04:53.849> right<00:04:55.339> but<00:04:56.339> it's<00:04:56.550> just

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
seconds when I turn right but it's just

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.339 
seconds when I turn right but it's just
it<00:04:57.059> just<00:04:57.119> bothers<00:04:57.749> me<00:04:57.869> because<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.289> really

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
it just bothers me because it's really

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.699 
it just bothers me because it's really
it's<00:04:58.709> really<00:04:58.979> low<00:04:59.219> and<00:04:59.599> you<00:05:00.599> know<00:05:00.719> if<00:05:00.959> it<00:05:01.199> if<00:05:01.379> it

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:01.709 
it's really low and you know if it if it

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:04.010 
it's really low and you know if it if it
wasn't<00:05:01.919> it's<00:05:02.520> not<00:05:02.699> consistent<00:05:03.119> so<00:05:03.569> I<00:05:03.599> don't

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
wasn't it's not consistent so I don't

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.079 
wasn't it's not consistent so I don't
know<00:05:04.139> it's<00:05:04.409> just<00:05:04.529> like<00:05:04.619> it's<00:05:05.490> like<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.759> RPMs

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:06.089 
know it's just like it's like the RPMs

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:07.999 
know it's just like it's like the RPMs
are<00:05:06.209> dropping<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:06.539> dope<00:05:06.899> so<00:05:07.169> low<00:05:07.439> that<00:05:07.709> it's

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
are dropping so dope so low that it's

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.889 
are dropping so dope so low that it's
the<00:05:08.309> car<00:05:08.580> fumbles<00:05:09.209> a<00:05:09.270> little<00:05:09.479> bit<00:05:09.599> when<00:05:09.779> it's

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:09.899 
the car fumbles a little bit when it's

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.339 
the car fumbles a little bit when it's
see<00:05:10.319> how<00:05:10.439> low<00:05:10.619> the<00:05:10.649> idle<00:05:11.009> is<00:05:12.020> that's<00:05:13.020> kind<00:05:13.289> of

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
see how low the idle is that's kind of

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.820 
see how low the idle is that's kind of
that's<00:05:13.619> kind<00:05:13.709> of<00:05:13.919> unusual<00:05:14.189> it's<00:05:14.610> really<00:05:14.819> low

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.199 

so<00:05:19.830> that's<00:05:19.949> just<00:05:20.039> my<00:05:20.219> question<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.729> why<00:05:20.879> is<00:05:20.939> the

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.209 
so that's just my question is why is the

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:25.159 
so that's just my question is why is the
fast<00:05:21.509> idle<00:05:21.749> so<00:05:22.080> low<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:23.430> put<00:05:24.419> in<00:05:24.509> fuel<00:05:24.749> injector

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
fast idle so low I put in fuel injector

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.769 
fast idle so low I put in fuel injector
treatment<00:05:25.619> so<00:05:25.800> hopefully<00:05:26.339> my<00:05:26.519> fuel<00:05:27.330> injectors

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
treatment so hopefully my fuel injectors

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.089 
treatment so hopefully my fuel injectors
will<00:05:28.080> be<00:05:28.229> treated

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
will be treated

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.429 
will be treated
maybe<00:05:29.639> that's<00:05:29.909> the<00:05:30.029> culprit<00:05:30.569> because<00:05:30.749> as<00:05:31.229> I

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
maybe that's the culprit because as I

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.219 
maybe that's the culprit because as I
Drive<00:05:31.679> the<00:05:31.860> car<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.219> idle<00:05:32.519> comes<00:05:32.729> up<00:05:32.939> so<00:05:33.749> it

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
Drive the car the idle comes up so it

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.369 
Drive the car the idle comes up so it
