the lifting of martial law in in Taiwan
20<00:00:14.130> years<00:00:14.340> ago<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> watershed<00:00:16.080> for<00:00:16.500> Taiwan

20 years ago was a watershed for Taiwan
but<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:18.029> believe<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.840> really<00:00:19.680> went<00:00:19.949> much

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
but I believe that it really went much

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.259 
but I believe that it really went much
