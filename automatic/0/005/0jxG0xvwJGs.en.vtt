Kenny for one he must be delighted we
side's<00:00:12.150> performance<00:00:13.250> yes<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.460> mean<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> result

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
side's performance yes I mean the result

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.160 
side's performance yes I mean the result
was<00:00:15.150> good<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.480> course<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> think<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
was good of course but I think the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.840 
was good of course but I think the
performance<00:00:16.500> overall<00:00:17.039> consider<00:00:17.520> we've<00:00:17.670> made

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
performance overall consider we've made

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
performance overall consider we've made
seven<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:18.690> eight<00:00:18.779> changes<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> first

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
seven or eight changes from the first

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.400 
seven or eight changes from the first
game<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.760> always<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.060> difficult<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
game it's always very difficult to to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
game it's always very difficult to to
keep<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.740> consistent<00:00:22.920> performance<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:23.820> i

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
keep a consistent performance but i

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.429 
keep a consistent performance but i
think<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.150> managed<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:25.019> you're

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
think they managed to do that for you're

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.740 
think they managed to do that for you're
the<00:00:25.529> most<00:00:25.710> part<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> game<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:27.330> saddle<00:00:27.689> up

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the most part of the game you saddle up

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.540 
the most part of the game you saddle up
very<00:00:28.019> dangerous<00:00:28.500> time<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> attack<00:00:29.070> today<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
very dangerous time the attack today and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
very dangerous time the attack today and
could<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.849> had<00:00:29.970> maybe<00:00:30.510> double<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> amount

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
could have had maybe double the amount

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.720 
could have had maybe double the amount
of<00:00:31.619> girl<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> must<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.340> been<00:00:32.430> pleasing

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
of girl that must have been pleasing

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.810 
of girl that must have been pleasing
yeah<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.640> been<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
yeah it was and you know that's been a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
yeah it was and you know that's been a
feature<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> were<00:00:37.350> able<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
feature all you really that were able to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.940 
feature all you really that were able to
create<00:00:38.820> many<00:00:39.120> chances<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:40.410> haven't<00:00:40.620> taken<00:00:40.770> as

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
create many chances we haven't taken as

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.900 
create many chances we haven't taken as
many<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.309> would<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.610> liked<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.840> our

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
many as we would have liked but our

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
many as we would have liked but our
Achilles<00:00:44.910> heel<00:00:45.120> has<00:00:45.270> been<00:00:45.480> our<00:00:45.899> defending<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
Achilles heel has been our defending of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
Achilles heel has been our defending of
anything<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.640> cause<00:00:47.969> ourselves<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
anything can we just cause ourselves a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
anything can we just cause ourselves a
few<00:00:48.870> skills<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.500> were<00:00:49.590> unnecessary<00:00:50.000> but

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
few skills that were unnecessary but

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
few skills that were unnecessary but
nevertheless<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.629> still<00:00:51.660> managed<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
nevertheless we still managed to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
nevertheless we still managed to
maintain<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> composure<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.780> keep

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
maintain you know the composure to keep

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.860 
maintain you know the composure to keep
playing<00:00:55.760> especially<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> pressurized<00:00:57.149> areas

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
playing especially in pressurized areas

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.389 
playing especially in pressurized areas
and<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.079> thought<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.410> did<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.890> well<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and I thought they did very well in that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
and I thought they did very well in that
respect<00:00:59.930> following<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.289> defeat<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.620> spin

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
respect following the defeat of spin

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.319 
respect following the defeat of spin

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
what is it you've been working on in

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.390 
what is it you've been working on in
training<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.870> how<00:01:04.170> did<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> combo

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
training and how did you see that combo

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
training and how did you see that combo
affected<00:01:05.909> L<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> lot<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
affected L not a lot really because you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
affected L not a lot really because you
know<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.090> day<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.420> between

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
know this does one one day in between

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
know this does one one day in between
it's<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.920> basically<00:01:11.310> giving<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.729> an

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it's just basically giving them an

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's just basically giving them an
opportunity<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.450> learn<00:01:13.049> from<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.770> just

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
opportunity to learn from the not just

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
opportunity to learn from the not just
the<00:01:14.040> spain<00:01:14.280> game<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:15.240> particularly<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> new

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the spain game but particularly the new

the spain game but particularly the new
boys<00:01:16.140> you've<00:01:16.290> trained<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:16.920> days

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
boys you've trained with this two days

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
boys you've trained with this two days
before<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> whatever<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.350> didn't<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.710> crammed

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
before so whatever we didn't we crammed

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
before so whatever we didn't we crammed
in<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> preparation<00:01:21.180> for

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in that that was the preparation for

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.249 
in that that was the preparation for
really<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.150> overall<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.110> make

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
really but you know overall just to make

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.960 
really but you know overall just to make
seven<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.619> eight<00:01:25.710> changes<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.670> always

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
seven or eight changes is always

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
seven or eight changes is always
difficult<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.170> always<00:01:28.560> got<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> feeling

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
difficult if you always got that feeling

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
difficult if you always got that feeling
of<00:01:29.159> trepidation<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.820> ink<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> quite<00:01:30.900> work

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
of trepidation of ink on a quite work

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.289 
of trepidation of ink on a quite work
out<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.650> plan<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> went<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> plan

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
out like your plan but it went to plan

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.690 
out like your plan but it went to plan
and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.930> thought<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.979> know<00:01:35.100> dominated<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and I thought we you know dominated the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
and I thought we you know dominated the
game<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.030> most<00:01:36.180> part<00:01:36.530> play<00:01:37.530> some<00:01:37.740> compose

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
game for the most part play some compose

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.609 
game for the most part play some compose

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
football when we needed to like you say

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
football when we needed to like you say
we<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.909> opportunity<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
we got a lot of the good opportunity to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
we got a lot of the good opportunity to
you<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.079> create<00:01:43.229> chances<00:01:43.590> scored<00:01:44.189> four

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you know create chances scored four

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
you know create chances scored four
goals<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.820> couldn't<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.600> can't

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
goals and couldn't be more so what can't

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.410

there's been a lot of talk recently

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.080 
there's been a lot of talk recently
about<00:02:21.170> inventing<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:22.010> DNA<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.549> English

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
about inventing a DNA of English

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.729 
about inventing a DNA of English
football<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.659> obviously<00:02:23.989> starts<00:02:24.409> at<00:02:24.560> this

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
football that obviously starts at this

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.459 
football that obviously starts at this
level<00:02:25.249> up<00:02:25.459> fast<00:02:25.760> attacking<00:02:26.389> player<00:02:27.200> from<00:02:27.379> the

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
level up fast attacking player from the

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.979 
level up fast attacking player from the
outside<00:02:27.829> there<00:02:28.129> is<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.639> a<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.299> know<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> DNA

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
outside there is that a you know the DNA

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.720 
outside there is that a you know the DNA
you'd<00:02:30.200> like<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.530> see<00:02:30.709> England<00:02:31.099> carry<00:02:31.310> forward

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
well I think our DNA is we have we have

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.369 
well I think our DNA is we have we have
got<00:02:35.030> English<00:02:35.329> qualities<00:02:35.780> which<00:02:35.959> we've<00:02:36.170> always

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
got English qualities which we've always

got English qualities which we've always
had<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:36.799> which<00:02:36.920> will<00:02:37.069> always<00:02:37.250> keep<00:02:37.599> hope<00:02:38.599> but

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
been a difficult thing for England youth

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.809 
been a difficult thing for England youth
team<00:02:51.169> you<00:02:51.349> know<00:02:51.439> managing<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.609> know<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
team you know managing the you know the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.879 
team you know managing the you know the
flow<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.239> game<00:02:53.349> seeing<00:02:54.349> games<00:02:54.680> outside

flow of the game seeing games outside

flow of the game seeing games outside
set<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.459> think<00:02:55.810> with<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.959> way<00:02:57.139> we're

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
set and I think with the way we're

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.229 
set and I think with the way we're
playing<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.040> what<00:02:58.280> would<00:02:58.459> teach<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:58.819> that

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
playing and what would teach and that

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.970 
playing and what would teach and that
would<00:02:59.389> be<00:02:59.419> quickly<00:03:00.049> established<00:03:00.620> i<00:03:00.680> think<00:03:00.859> is

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
would be quickly established i think is

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.659 
would be quickly established i think is
a<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.430> know<00:03:01.519> as<00:03:01.760> part<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.359> our<00:03:02.449> DNA
