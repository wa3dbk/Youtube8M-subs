00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:07.261
Mister, I'm tired of it! Every single time I got the ball Messi 
 looks at me angrily if I don't pass the ball to him

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:11.602
Mister, are you listening to me?

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.783
Guardiola looks better in a suit than you

00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:26.856
Oh Lord! So it's true what the media said about my 
 game: Villa has disappeard. Now people can't see me!

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:31.472
I'm like that weird boy with cold breath from movie with Bruce Willis 

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.721
Sorry I wasn't listening to you. I'm addicted to this song Stronger...

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:42.758
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger... Talk, 
 talk now, what you wanted to say?

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:46.869
Messi looks at me angrily if I don't pass the ball to him

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.522
You should talk to someone who's in charge here

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:51.997
And who is in charge here? You, right?

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:56.015
Sandro Rosell?
Bilderberg Club?

00:00:57.024 --> 00:01:05.024
No, well it seems that you have no idea how things 
 work here. I'm just an advisor, sit down please

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:13.047
Villa, Villa, Villa

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:20.924
You come here, to my office on the day of my son's baptism and 
 you're telling me that you don't like to pass the ball to me

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:24.857
No, I don't like that you look at 
 me badly, even more badly than Ozil

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:30.019
But what I've done for you to treat me this way
I 
 don't remember when you made good pass to me

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
Last time I passed some

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.151
Oh, so you actually played yesterday?

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.420
haha, good joke Don Messino

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:43.100
But why Don Messino? Who is in charge in Barca? Messi?

00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:47.860
Villa, son, in Barca rule those who score goals, and who doesn't score...

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:51.120
Cement shoes and into a  Mediterranean river!

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:55.700
Excuse me, Godfather, but  Mediterranean is not river, it's a sea

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.400
uhm, well, it's also a river, very beautiful, with picturesque river mouth

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Villa, look, Barca is a family and Messi is Godfather. And if 
 Godfather wants you to pass the ball to him, you 

00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:16.160
will pass ball to him

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:19.400
very good, very good
I see that you understood

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:24.210
and now you can kiss your Messino's hand and go home

00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:39.910
he is a good boy, but to make sure he 
 won't forget put a horse' head in his bed

00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:43.850
We don't have any horse's head left. Laporta ate all.
