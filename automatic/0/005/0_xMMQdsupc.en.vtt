something<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.250> should<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:15.320> especially<00:00:16.320> when

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
something you should do especially when

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.900 
something you should do especially when
you<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> new<00:00:16.859> bird<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.250> helps<00:00:17.490> train<00:00:17.730> them

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
you have a new bird it helps train them

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.160 
you have a new bird it helps train them
because<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.180> won't<00:00:18.270> fly<00:00:18.570> away<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> as

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
because they won't fly away from you as

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.130 
because they won't fly away from you as
much<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.699> like<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:20.850> mom's<00:00:21.060> bird<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.689> actually

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
much and like my mom's bird it actually

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.320 
much and like my mom's bird it actually
flew<00:00:22.350> away<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.890> got<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> sigh<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.090> flew<00:00:24.269> away

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
flew away I got out a sigh and flew away

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.550 
flew away I got out a sigh and flew away
so<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.779> your<00:00:24.900> bird's<00:00:25.050> wings<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.410> clipped

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
so if your bird's wings are clipped

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.429 
so if your bird's wings are clipped
something<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> can't<00:00:27.390> happen<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.960> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
something like that can't happen and it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.320 
something like that can't happen and it
really<00:00:28.740> does<00:00:28.890> help<00:00:29.099> them<00:00:29.369> train<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.150> they

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
really does help them train because they

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.999 
really does help them train because they
can't<00:00:30.570> fly<00:00:30.779> away<00:00:30.960> from<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.769> they'll<00:00:31.949> be

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
can't fly away from you so they'll be

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
can't fly away from you so they'll be
less<00:00:32.189> likely<00:00:32.219> don't<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.820> fly<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.690> top

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
less likely don't you know fly up on top

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.010 
less likely don't you know fly up on top
of<00:00:33.989> windows<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> such<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> don't<00:00:36.120> cut<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
of windows and such so don't cut a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.360 
of windows and such so don't cut a
bird's<00:00:37.260> wing<00:00:37.320> tstewy<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> pretty<00:00:38.040> good<00:00:38.160> about

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
bird's wing tstewy is pretty good about

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.160 
bird's wing tstewy is pretty good about
it<00:00:38.520> birdies<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.030> worse<00:00:39.270> we'll<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.809> her<00:00:39.960> next

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it birdies a lot worse we'll do her next

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.110 
it birdies a lot worse we'll do her next
but<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> nice<00:00:40.829> bird<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.250> Stewie<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.969> just

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
fingers like this it doesn't hurt him at

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.830 
fingers like this it doesn't hurt him at
all<00:00:58.649> he's<00:00:58.859> not<00:00:59.210> not<00:01:00.210> hurt<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.480> all

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.190> scissors<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> you're

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and then take your scissors and you're

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.530 
and then take your scissors and you're
going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> clip<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:05.270> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> wing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
going to want to clip up on the wing

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
going to want to clip up on the wing
just<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.500> halfway<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> feathers<00:01:08.460> if

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
just like halfway down the feathers if

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.880 
just like halfway down the feathers if
you<00:01:08.670> clip<00:01:08.909> too<00:01:09.090> far<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.409> make<00:01:10.530> them<00:01:10.650> bleed

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
you clip too far you can make them bleed

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.440 
you clip too far you can make them bleed
so<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> never<00:01:11.369> start<00:01:11.790> clipping<00:01:12.000> too<00:01:12.240> far

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so you never start clipping too far

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
so you never start clipping too far
start<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.110> clipping<00:01:13.530> less<00:01:14.100> before<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> go

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
start out clipping less before you go

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
start out clipping less before you go
more<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.600> clip<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.229> down<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
more don't clip all the way down the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.560 
more don't clip all the way down the
wing<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.979> mainly<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> clip<00:01:18.119> off<00:01:18.299> these

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
wing you mainly want to clip off these

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
wing you mainly want to clip off these
top<00:01:18.840> feathers<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.619> don't<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> clip<00:01:20.280> off

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
top feathers you don't have to clip off

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
top feathers you don't have to clip off
all<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> wing<00:01:21.509> too<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> by

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
all the way down the wing too to the by

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
all the way down the wing too to the by
his<00:01:22.770> body<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:23.970> real<00:01:24.090> simple<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
his body so it's real simple you just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
his body so it's real simple you just
hold<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.340> then<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.580> cut<00:01:26.700> him

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
hold it out and then you just cut him

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
hold it out and then you just cut him
off<00:01:26.909> he<00:01:27.720> doesn't<00:01:28.020> feel<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.200> he<00:01:28.470> didn't<00:01:28.650> react

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
off he doesn't feel it he didn't react

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.890 
off he doesn't feel it he didn't react
at<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> do<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> other<00:01:30.570> wing

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
at all and then you do the other wing

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
at all and then you do the other wing
start<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.549> clipping<00:01:32.850> too<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
start out not clipping too much if you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.030 
start out not clipping too much if you
have<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> clip<00:01:34.110> off<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.530> because<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> can

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
have to clip off more because you can

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.120 
have to clip off more because you can
still<00:01:35.250> fly<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
still fly you can do that but if you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.210 
still fly you can do that but if you
clip<00:01:38.340> too<00:01:38.460> far<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.939> bleed

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.870
