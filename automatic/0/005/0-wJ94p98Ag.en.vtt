and<00:01:26.580> appliances<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> we

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and appliances but the one thing that we

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.490 
and appliances but the one thing that we
ignored<00:01:29.159> were<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.940> vinyl<00:01:30.270> siding<00:01:30.450> doors<00:01:30.810> well

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.280 
ignored were the vinyl siding doors well
when<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> first<00:01:32.009> saw<00:01:32.280> Jamie's<00:01:32.940> existing<00:01:33.780> vinyl

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
when I first saw Jamie's existing vinyl

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.340 
when I first saw Jamie's existing vinyl
door<00:01:34.710> unit<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.670> was<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.360> real<00:01:36.659> contradiction<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
door unit it was a real contradiction to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
door unit it was a real contradiction to
her<00:01:37.860> existing<00:01:38.310> kitchen<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.790> screen<00:01:39.210> system

her existing kitchen the screen system

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.670 
her existing kitchen the screen system
didn't<00:01:39.899> work<00:01:39.930> well

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
didn't work well

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
didn't work well
the<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.100> panel<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:42.030> didn't<00:01:42.300> operate

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the right panel really didn't operate

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
the right panel really didn't operate
well<00:01:43.080> at<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.770> could<00:01:44.430> tell<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.060> door

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
well at all I could tell that the door

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
well at all I could tell that the door
wasn't<00:01:45.990> being<00:01:46.170> too<00:01:46.350> energy-efficient<00:01:47.220> as

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
wasn't being too energy-efficient as

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
wasn't being too energy-efficient as
well<00:01:47.610> given<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.049> was<00:01:49.140> operating

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
well given the way that it was operating

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.760 
well given the way that it was operating
we<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> pretty<00:01:51.119> big<00:01:51.360> heating<00:01:51.840> bill<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.740> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
we have a pretty big heating bill so I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
we have a pretty big heating bill so I
would<00:01:53.040> love<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.880> doors<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.570> that
