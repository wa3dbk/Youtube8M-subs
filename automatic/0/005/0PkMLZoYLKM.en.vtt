00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.910
 or the pretty geldo welcome we're going to 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.910
 make a ponytail with two or three 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.560
 buns depending on the length of the hair 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.830
 they are going to take here a small piece of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.830
 hair 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.530
 and here we are going to use elastics 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.530
 transparent 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 we put the elastic 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 and they will take the first bow tie 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.210
 in the comfortable 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.220
 they take the second elastic that is the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.970
 technique that I showed them in that video 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.140
 from lady the garage 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.180
 and they are going to go around twice 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.180
 and take the other side of the monkey 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.570
 here they are already the first monkey 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.090
 here what we are going to do is take a 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.320
 piece of hair that we have from the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.570
 horsetail thin and with the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.330
 crooked 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.140
 we will pass it down 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.360
 ok is to take a transparent elastic 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.760
 also and put it pasted here so that 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.000
 do not notice the piece of hair that 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.980
 we went behind and stayed fixed we go to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 put an elastic with care 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.060
 then to do two laps 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.460
 and we're going to upload it as high as 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.460
 we can 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.140
 because our bow is already fixed 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.700
 there now let's take another elastic and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 we are going to put it below 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.650
 here is not staying what was left 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.690
 of the first bow and this does not work 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.930
 Now then let's take hair 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.769
 from one side 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.769
 and the other 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.790
 okay 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.739
 here we take out the first tie 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.610
 closing one lap 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.040
 and then they want to take the second 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.040
 side 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.709
 this right now we're going to grab 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.239
 Now let's accommodate 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.730
 this we will fix here again 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.730
 we put an elastic to fix the monkey 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.330
 the dresser 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.440
 very well that you enjoy it and even the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.440
 next goodbye 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.310
 again
