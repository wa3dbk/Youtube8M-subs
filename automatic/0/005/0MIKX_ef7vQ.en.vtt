00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.559
 Good day tourist with you 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.750
 tournament bayannyh locations the salon got 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.529
 on the map of you field as you can see the bottom 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.020
 list and what's sad about the enemy 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.980
 there are very serious players very 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.910
 high stat at at15 high start 13 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:29.320
 75 and a good t-34 as you see 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.739
 spar juice 15 34 water 15 understand why 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.680
 and t-34 but because it is his contact 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.460
 if he is expected to play by 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.730
 2 3 less we sunni tower then it can 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.410
 drag fight his art should foxit 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.840
 necessarily 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.390
 At15 is expected in the city of 4 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.720
 lines so we won't go to the second 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.250
 also not going as t-34 and at15 too 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.790
 can rumpled bum this is dangerous 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.879
 the gun just won't go here on the fifth 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.940
 the sixth is rather the fifth problem here in 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.619
 that enemy trenches are expected here 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.990
 miss 5 in tone with high probability 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.270
 percent 8 sharper succeed as 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.880
 normal skilovye players from serious 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.740
 from the compartment will play to the card through the center 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.659
 occupy these houses ride here 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.399
 so I stand after time see got up in 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.710
 the club ask the luminaries and actually right now I 'm waiting 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.270
 I am afraid of him and I am preparing to run away myself 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.600
 the other side of the card if he suddenly 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.680
 I am 300 honestly country to see more 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.780
 since he is not going 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.520
 I am waiting for you diligently 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.710
 Apparently he would not have appeared long ago 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.979
 Basically, since I have a blank check, he 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.679
 I decided to give it is impossible to play here 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.020
 can I fully get the advantage 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.080
 this position here is the 5th line at the muscles 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.420
 is that 4 line cord usually 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.929
 served and each other and now with this 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.250
 sides to the right through the right side of the city 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.350
 it is usually possible to find them and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.850
 shoot while not distracted as 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.090
 now i was doing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.310
 because once everything turns out not always but 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.350
 chances are high if you get out 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.790
 tester step and dismounted and either was not 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.290
 either you killed them then 70 percent what you 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 be able to calm down 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.400
 see at is-3 large delena and had time 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.400
 I shoot strand Azadi 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.359
 actually it costs what it 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.359
 battlefield he will clearly fall with nko 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 and screed as we see not played 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.860
 Chinese opponent did not reach 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.959
 rise his charge was down below 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.080
 he was unlucky he could go through 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.360
 center they are so he is too cautious 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.180
 trance 7 out of five another book we see 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.800
 on Zelenka beats 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.110
 35 simply did not play on either show 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.650
 any kind of weird with so much 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.690
 so do not play the little son gave a ride or 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.930
 account sold 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.550
 wander okay this bird food 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.100
 other flank so how to play right 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.040
 dangerous there is a Chinese ambush and plus sts and 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.100
 haircuts about the case I 'm not going to throw 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.990
 to do with these comrades honestly 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.350
 saying you're 15 too for all the money but not for 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.470
 all the money really see killed the guy so 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.940
 do not play do n't know maybe either 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.800
 something he was not lucky or favor 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.170
 did we boot something like that happened 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.070
 well, or just can't play pawn 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.880
 especially so far heavy and fat 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.580
 of course on the way it was necessary to steal 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.560
 4 money at once closer to the city 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.870
 get behind the house and there is severe home 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.510
 our heavy 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.230
 that's sitting on 3 to 2 on the fact 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.209
 just about anything 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.780
 you just need a tank and you need it with 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.819
 the tower , the shells of honest peace is just a loss 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.590
 of time 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.249
 the enemy may not stick out may not 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.450
 we are not obliged to climb, plus 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.790
 just highlight 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.879
 and there will be a cinema march visibility potter 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.469
 4 and the right thing to do is actually 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.659
 how is it really paise not even 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.340
 for statistics namely for his tower 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.129
 and catch on the boat 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.790
 in principle, the department looked dedicated 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.910
 a little bit 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.349
 and now I'm going as far as there 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.389
 a bit of the enemy here is nobody else 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.389
 No actually the Chinese are vegetables on 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.550
 semi really i'm going away going round 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.440
 disassemble them at15 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.590
 in fact, now will get cognizes 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.960
 so put your mistakes in that 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.290
 the signal is too passive did not kill us 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.970
 while we were tyazh in the city and 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.420
 accordingly, it will now be disassembled with 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.420
 different sides 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.290
 so you can see the wallpaper decided not that 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.000
 that not only the fact that I was there some 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.640
 The letters of the position held although in principle 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.920
 I took kika positions allowed for movement 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.810
 expected the enemy 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.570
 supposed them to act preparing for them 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.270
 and not even apt shooting though 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.460
 Basically something fisher shot 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.800
 decided to be very strong 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.710
 enemy players just did not play because 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.510
 I write 375 really that bill for all day 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.890
 sits and this green stuff well, nothing at all 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.520
 more able to play just too 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.520
 passive position 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.750
 he shoots me might even kill 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.650
 frankly, this is nothing 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.650
 rallies will drag 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.960
 it is necessary to drag while it is hot the screen than 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.849
 Now it is possible to find dotting 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.139
 will succeed 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.870
 grieve succeeds 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:02.460
 study and comes to an end thanks for 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.120
 attention successful battles you especially good luck 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.120
