the flashlight you can see that the
water<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.250> bluish<00:01:00.829> hour<00:01:01.829> at

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
water is actually a bit bluish hour at

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:16.570 
water is actually a bit bluish hour at
normal<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.090> show<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.670 

stuff<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:21.110> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.290> there's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> bleep

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
stuff and the can see there's a bleep

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
now if you take a look from the top mind

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.630 
now if you take a look from the top mind
you<00:01:31.730> is<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:33.290> white<00:01:33.710> colored<00:01:34.070> box<00:01:34.430> light

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
you is a is a white colored box light

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.800 
you is a is a white colored box light
see<00:01:35.140> quite<00:01:36.140> close<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:36.530> like<00:01:37.060> if<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.390> shine

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
see quite close that's like if you shine

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.530 
see quite close that's like if you shine
from<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.860> bottom<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:40.940> take<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.180> look<00:01:41.360> on

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
from the bottom and you take a look on

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.310 
from the bottom and you take a look on
the<00:01:41.600> top<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.570> see<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.140> light

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
the top you can see that the light

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.190 
the top you can see that the light
especially<00:01:48.530> reddish<00:01:49.810> consider<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.990> lights

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
especially reddish consider the lights

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.880 
especially reddish consider the lights
actually<00:01:51.410> reddish<00:01:52.960> this<00:01:53.960> experiment<00:01:54.740> can

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
actually reddish this experiment can

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.960 
actually reddish this experiment can
also<00:01:55.070> show<00:01:55.400> why<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.950> orange<00:01:57.950> e-rate<00:01:58.310> when

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
also show why is it orange e-rate when

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.920 
also show why is it orange e-rate when
it's<00:01:59.150> sunset<00:02:00.460> let<00:02:01.460> me<00:02:01.550> add<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.730> few<00:02:02.030> more<00:02:02.060> drops

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
it's sunset let me add a few more drops

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's sunset let me add a few more drops
of<00:02:03.170> milk<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.740> show<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:03.980> clearer

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.030 

now<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.000> experiment<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.800> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
now for this experiment if you want to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.610 
now for this experiment if you want to
just<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> blue<00:02:17.730> color<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.410> add<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
just see the blue color you can add a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.550 
just see the blue color you can add a
little<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.190> milk<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.350> add

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
little bit of milk but you can add

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.990 
little bit of milk but you can add
excess<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:24.050> find<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> orange<00:02:25.950> reddish<00:02:26.580> color

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
excess to find the orange reddish color

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.120 
excess to find the orange reddish color
like<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.020> sunset<00:02:28.290> I'll<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.970> blue<00:02:33.680> but<00:02:34.680> when

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
like a sunset I'll see is blue but when

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.920 
like a sunset I'll see is blue but when
you<00:02:35.250> see<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> top<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:37.410> reddish<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.930> once

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you see from the top is reddish and once

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.110 
you see from the top is reddish and once
again<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:41.370> highlight<00:02:42.200> highlight<00:02:45.950> right

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
again it is a highlight highlight right

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.210 
again it is a highlight highlight right
we<00:02:48.120> also<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:48.840> from<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.200> side<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:50.040> put

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
we also can see from the side if you put

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
we also can see from the side if you put
a<00:02:50.250> water<00:02:50.490> at<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> side<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.050> see<00:02:52.230> here

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
a water at the side that you see here

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.920 
a water at the side that you see here
it's<00:02:52.650> bluish<00:02:52.880> but<00:02:53.880> yet<00:02:54.060> down<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> bit

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
it's bluish but yet down here is a bit

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.190 
it's bluish but yet down here is a bit
reddish<00:02:55.190> can<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.250> see<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> difference<00:02:56.790> right

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
reddish can you see the difference right

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.130 
reddish can you see the difference right
blueish<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:59.040> yet<00:02:59.340> ready<00:02:59.550> yeah<00:03:00.480> ready

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
blueish and yet ready yeah ready

blueish and yet ready yeah ready
yeah<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:03.450> will<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.990> explanation<00:03:04.260> why

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
yeah so this will be the explanation why

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.310 
yeah so this will be the explanation why
the<00:03:05.820> sky<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.120> blue<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.890> midday<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:09.320> here
