00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 there 

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.930
 may be in this case shorter palacio with 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.170
 skins attacked 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.150
 pogba fields and i find that kicking and 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.860
 Absolutely put on the case although Pogba 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.350
 fell with pleasure but for what 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.390
 Palacios got the second yellow for this 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.580
 push or for a trip to 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.650
 arbiter for life to explain this here I 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.160
 I do not know but whatever it was Karim 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.680
 benzema 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.699
 confidently realized a penalty not the french 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.740
 sure to have gone on a break leading in the bill 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.870
 let's say 10 confidently or not sure it 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.640
 everyone already understands say so measure 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.770
 own depravity in general 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.550
 French overweight was and they all lead 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.620
 these legally 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.149
 and what will be in the second half goalkeeper 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.100
 wheel market turnover 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.040
 but now this is not the most behind 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.190
 France squad score 2 well it was 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.079
 beautiful though really beautiful ball 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.630
 maybe when he flies in the gate without 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.800
 questions they are so we see not seen 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.800
 well then 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.450
 and I love his expression salon 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.390
 beauty 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.760
 Well, where to go Kolya 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.360
 percy on this championship is already beautiful from 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.590
 all the rest separated well yes thanks 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.759
 with of course here launched the ball into the goal 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.759
 this goalkeeper rumble 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 but on this on repeat seems that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.070
 was not at first it seems that was 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.560
 silently look 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.560
 hope will be like the Volga 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.990
 and glad it is there and here 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.990
 and here 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.980
 and here we see that the ball crossed the line 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.700
 here you go 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.920
 well, no one kind of climatization you all 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 do benzema protrusion correctly 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.650
 smuggled here a question centimeters three 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.040
 rods 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.850
 we already know that the ball crossed 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 turnover line 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.290
 and the spirit 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.180
 in evaluate gate action 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.840
 I'm in the first half, your corner is still 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.410
 let me go it seems to you brown benzema and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.410
 skeptics of karim 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 listen to all that we have in the championship 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.310
 everything happens very quickly 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.310
 on the fourth day 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.640
 for every taste 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.750
 hat trick conditional protocol he won't enter 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.440
 I think itâ€™s rather more for 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.530
 gossip 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.920
 more izzek after the second goal was recorded 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.620
 like an auto goal goalkeeper vali norris but I 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.840
 I think that formally all the same guys 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.350
 teammates I talked about this 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.710
 non-native 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.620
 and about this should congratulate measles sea 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.630
 track of that protocol was not there 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.930
 written to him and about the protocol yet 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.450
 there is time 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.590
 same 2 or 3 3 yellow cards chamonix 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.590
 what is true sometime
