I've<00:00:15.840> been<00:00:15.930> doing<00:00:16.110> this<00:00:16.429> we've<00:00:17.429> been<00:00:17.609> using

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
I've been doing this we've been using

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.679 
I've been doing this we've been using
GAF<00:00:18.570> probably<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> last<00:00:20.300> eight<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.480> ten

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
GAF probably for the last eight to ten

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
GAF probably for the last eight to ten
years<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:22.679> been<00:00:22.890> using<00:00:23.070> geo<00:00:23.429> single<00:00:23.939> for

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
years I've been using geo single for

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
years I've been using geo single for
about<00:00:24.210> 30<00:00:24.539> years<00:00:24.749> now<00:00:24.900> I've<00:00:25.289> been<00:00:25.560> using<00:00:25.740> GAF

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
about 30 years now I've been using GAF

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.029 
about 30 years now I've been using GAF
or<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:27.119> would<00:00:27.480> say<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.839> last<00:00:28.050> 20<00:00:28.679> years<00:00:28.710> are

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
or I would say the last 20 years are

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.489 
or I would say the last 20 years are
better<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.669> started<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.900> we've

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
better which started with them and we've

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.560 
better which started with them and we've
continued<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.189> them<00:00:32.340> ever<00:00:32.490> since<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.300> color

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
continued with them ever since the color

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.380 
continued with them ever since the color
selection<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.559> style<00:00:35.190> selection<00:00:35.789> is<00:00:36.149> so

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
selection and style selection is so

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
selection and style selection is so
varied<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.379> fit<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.770> type<00:00:38.010> of
