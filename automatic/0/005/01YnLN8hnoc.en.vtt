00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the new advanced polymeric body system

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.590 
the new advanced polymeric body system
which<00:01:08.140> makes<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.619> frame<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.280> reel

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
which makes the frame of the reel

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.719 
which makes the frame of the reel
stronger<00:01:10.600> more<00:01:11.080> durable<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:11.860> lighter<00:01:12.430> than

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
stronger more durable and lighter than

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.760 
stronger more durable and lighter than
your<00:01:12.909> normal<00:01:13.330> traditional<00:01:13.600> plastic<00:01:14.470> parts

your normal traditional plastic parts

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.830 
your normal traditional plastic parts
which<00:01:15.250> means<00:01:15.610> when<00:01:15.909> I'm<00:01:16.030> going<00:01:16.330> up<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.689> down
