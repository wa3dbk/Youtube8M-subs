00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910 
can lay the joists on the second floor
there<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.109> that's<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.500> doing<00:00:22.680> today

putting<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> joists<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.670> which<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.300> create

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
putting the joists in which will create

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.929 
putting the joists in which will create
the<00:00:24.949> ceiling<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.220> first<00:00:26.400> floor<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
our beams in place all of our door

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.290 
our beams in place all of our door
openings<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.640> already<00:00:41.820> been<00:00:41.940> figured<00:00:42.210> out

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
openings have already been figured out

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
openings have already been figured out
with<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.750> couple<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> things<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
with a couple of things that we like to

with a couple of things that we like to
do<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.250> our<00:00:44.430> framing<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> can

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
do with our framing if you can you can

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
do with our framing if you can you can
see<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.160> these<00:00:50.309> funny

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
see up there you can see these funny

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.840 
see up there you can see these funny
little<00:00:50.820> shapes<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.870> drawn<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.410> each<00:00:52.850> one

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
little shapes that are drawn on each one

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.600 
little shapes that are drawn on each one
of<00:00:53.969> these<00:00:54.059> joists<00:00:54.770> what<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
of these joists what that is is that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.729 
of these joists what that is is that
tells<00:00:57.120> us<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:58.199> side<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.770> that<00:01:00.020> joist<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tells us which side of that joist the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.310 
tells us which side of that joist the
crown<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> basically<00:01:02.940> joists<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
crown is so basically joists when you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
crown is so basically joists when you
look<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.619> wood<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.100> always<00:01:05.400> has<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> hump<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
look at wood it always has a hump in it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.880 
look at wood it always has a hump in it
there's<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.869> never<00:01:07.110> dead<00:01:07.409> straight<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's it's never dead straight it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.080 
there's it's never dead straight it
always<00:01:08.040> moves<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.909> either

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
always moves a little bit it's either

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.920 
always moves a little bit it's either
bows<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:10.049> humps<00:01:10.350> whatever<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.630> like

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
bows or humps whatever but what we like

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
bows or humps whatever but what we like
to<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> week<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.909> what's<00:01:15.299> called

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to do is week what we do what's called

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320 
to do is week what we do what's called
crowning<00:01:16.020> crowning<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.220> wood<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.150> we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
crowning crowning all of our wood so we

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
crowning crowning all of our wood so we
make<00:01:18.540> sure<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:20.150> these

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
make sure that when these go in these

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
make sure that when these go in these
joists<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> crown<00:01:22.830> sits<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.430> top

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
joists go in that the crown sits up top

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.570 
joists go in that the crown sits up top
so<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> hump<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.439> installed<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.369> as

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so the hump is is installed this way as

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.660 
so the hump is is installed this way as
opposed<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:28.020> way<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.430> does

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
opposed to this way and what that does

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
opposed to this way and what that does
is<00:01:29.880> over<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> years<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> house<00:01:31.350> settles

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is over the years as this house settles

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
is over the years as this house settles
out<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.220> wood<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.640> generally<00:01:33.000> settle<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
out that wood will generally settle to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.920 
out that wood will generally settle to
flat<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.960> opposed<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> dip<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> put

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
flat as opposed to dip so we want to put

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710 
flat as opposed to dip so we want to put
our<00:01:37.079> lumber<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> crown<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.689> all

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
our lumber and crown like that so all

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.569 
our lumber and crown like that so all
these<00:01:40.200> pieces<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.799> been<00:01:40.920> crowned<00:01:41.130> every

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
these pieces have been crowned every

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.219 
these pieces have been crowned every
last<00:01:41.790> piece<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.180> wood<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.750> goes<00:01:42.869> into<00:01:43.110> our

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
last piece of wood that goes into our

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.429 
last piece of wood that goes into our
ceiling<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.000> through<00:01:45.270> our<00:01:45.360> house<00:01:45.570> we
