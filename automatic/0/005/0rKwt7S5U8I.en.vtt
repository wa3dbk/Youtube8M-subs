you
so<00:00:27.769> yeah<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.070> figured<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> needed<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.000> at

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
so yeah I figured I needed to do this at

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
so yeah I figured I needed to do this at
some<00:00:30.420> point<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.500> probably<00:00:31.560> best<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> get

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
some point and it's probably best to get

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.500 
some point and it's probably best to get
it<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:33.300> soonish<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.739> kind<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
it out soonish because it's kind of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.639 
it out soonish because it's kind of
important<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> today<00:00:39.090> today<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.410> your

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
important kind of so today today is your

important kind of so today today is your
chance<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.340> become<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:42.030> certified<00:00:42.450> map<00:00:43.320> maker

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
chance to become a certified map maker

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
chance to become a certified map maker
now<00:00:44.640> before<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.450> ie<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.559> going

now before I get into that ie I'm going
to<00:00:46.800> need<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> explain<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> map<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:47.850> bit

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to need to explain the map a little bit

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
to need to explain the map a little bit
more<00:00:48.390> kind<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.039> important<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
more kind of because it's important and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.150 
more kind of because it's important and
relevant<00:00:50.879> ok<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.899> I've<00:00:52.680> already<00:00:52.770> explained

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
relevant ok so as I've already explained

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.689 
relevant ok so as I've already explained
before<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.670> map<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.860> exploration<00:00:55.860> ok

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
before this map is about exploration ok

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.479 
before this map is about exploration ok
exploring<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> universe<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.320> finding<00:00:59.250> stuff

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
exploring the universe and finding stuff

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.250 
exploring the universe and finding stuff
in<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> universe<00:01:00.000> gathering<00:01:00.960> resources

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
in the universe gathering resources

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.060 
in the universe gathering resources
finding<00:01:01.829> stuff<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> jazz<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
finding stuff and all that jazz so

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.410 
finding stuff and all that jazz so
naturally<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.460> universe<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.000> universe

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
naturally in this universe this universe

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.289 
naturally in this universe this universe
needs<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.170> lot<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.650> things<00:01:08.100> ok<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
needs to have a lot of things ok so it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.539 
needs to have a lot of things ok so it
needs<00:01:09.560> objects<00:01:10.560> everywhere<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> needs<00:01:11.310> lots

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
needs objects everywhere it needs lots

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
needs objects everywhere it needs lots
of<00:01:11.729> content<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> explore<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
of content to explore but the thing is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.010 
of content to explore but the thing is
is<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.450> I'm<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.750> person<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:18.020> can't

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is that I'm just one person and I can't

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.440 
is that I'm just one person and I can't
really<00:01:19.290> realistically<00:01:20.070> create<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.000> many

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
really realistically create as many

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.950 
really realistically create as many
things<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> create<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.780> map

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
things as I want to create so this map

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.530 
things as I want to create so this map
could<00:01:25.229> never<00:01:25.590> could<00:01:26.369> never<00:01:26.580> meet<00:01:27.360> my

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
could never could never meet my

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
could never could never meet my
standards<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.310> own<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
standards if I'm on my own so this is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
standards if I'm on my own so this is
where<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> come<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.400> what<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> want<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> do

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
is I want you to submit your own space

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.080 
is I want you to submit your own space
object<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.090> map<00:01:39.390> ok<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> mean<00:01:41.939> by

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
object to this map ok so what I mean by

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
object to this map ok so what I mean by
space<00:01:42.390> object<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.110> something<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.950> planet

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
space object is something like a planet

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.090 
space object is something like a planet
something<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.420> star<00:01:45.720> something<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
something like a star something like a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.210 
something like a star something like a
like<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> wormhole<00:01:48.590> something<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> comet

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
like a wormhole something like a comet

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.160 
like a wormhole something like a comet
something<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> space<00:01:51.750> station<00:01:51.990> or

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
something like a space station or

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.600 
something like a space station or
something<00:01:52.350> something<00:01:52.649> space<00:01:53.130> related

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
something something space related

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.539 
something something space related
something<00:01:53.790> Spacey<00:01:54.720> object<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.590> k<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.399> right

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
something Spacey object do k all right

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.190 
something Spacey object do k all right
so<00:01:56.759> there<00:01:56.969> are<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.420> requirements

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so there are actually some requirements

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
so there are actually some requirements
that<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.829> asked<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.930> two<00:02:01.310> distinct<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.520> ok

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that I asked you to two distinct to ok

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.490 
that I asked you to two distinct to ok
so<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.899> go<00:02:04.049> outside<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.380> these

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so don't go outside of these

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
so don't go outside of these
requirements<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.219> you're<00:02:05.340> gonna<00:02:06.020> kind

finding resources around the map and
because<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:01.050> ask<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:02.040> limit

because of that I ask that you limit
your<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:04.230> resources<00:04:04.769> used<00:04:05.190> absolute<00:04:06.180> maximum

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
your the resources used absolute maximum

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.259 
your the resources used absolute maximum
of<00:04:06.930> five<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.250> don't<00:04:09.209> use<00:04:09.750> 30<00:04:10.970> different<00:04:11.970> blocks

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
of five so don't use 30 different blocks

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.810 
of five so don't use 30 different blocks
in<00:04:12.600> your<00:04:12.660> build<00:04:13.110> or<00:04:13.500> your<00:04:13.620> anything<00:04:14.280> because

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
in your build or your anything because

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.520 
in your build or your anything because
I'm<00:04:15.570> not<00:04:15.720> gonna<00:04:15.840> accept<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.320> want<00:04:16.470> an

I'm not gonna accept it I want an

I'm not gonna accept it I want an
absolute<00:04:17.070> maximum<00:04:17.489> fine<00:04:17.609> I'm<00:04:17.760> not

absolute maximum fine I'm not

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.520 
absolute maximum fine I'm not
recommending<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.479> use<00:04:18.660> 5<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.080> absolute

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
recommending you use 5 but absolute

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.080 
recommending you use 5 but absolute
maximum<00:04:19.859> 5<00:04:20.040> because<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.400> don't<00:04:20.609> want<00:04:20.790> there<00:04:21.060> to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
maximum 5 because I don't want there to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.570 
maximum 5 because I don't want there to
be<00:04:21.239> too<00:04:21.510> much<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.260> something<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.979> one<00:04:23.310> area

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
be too much of something in one area

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.710 
be too much of something in one area
because<00:04:23.970> otherwise<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.300> would<00:04:24.390> sort<00:04:24.690> of

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
because otherwise you would sort of

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.870 
because otherwise you would sort of
eliminate<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> purpose<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.800> also<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.760> you're

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
eliminate the purpose and also if you're

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.650 
eliminate the purpose and also if you're
using<00:04:26.910> tor

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
you can build structures if if they're

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.940 
you can build structures if if they're
