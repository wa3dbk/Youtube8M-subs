00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.199

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.660

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.519
 place at munich airport the children 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.320
 from the airport those employed here 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.919
 be cared for competently and lovingly 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.999
 while the parents work at the airport 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.640
 because the previous accommodation 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.890
 germany 's first airport kita in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.230
 an office building too little space and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.629
 Facilities offered by the airport 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.610
 munich gmbh in the visitor 's park of 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.949
 airports a new domicile for the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.960
 offspring created 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.430
 now the opening was celebrated and 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.350
 the speakers included the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.329
 freisinger mayor tobias 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.250
 eschenbacher because the cathedral city has 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.140
 promoted this project from the beginning 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.670
 As you can see from the example 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.170
 it also extensions at the airport 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.500
 which we see quite positively 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.149
 and in that sense, of course, it's one too 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.410
 Workplace-related day care centers 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.620
 We take care of course 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.940
 with words and where we are, of course 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.050
 want to bring in and we are 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.670
 Of course , glad that in freisinger 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.000
 operator with the red cross found 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.140
 is 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.320
 the best for this 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.790
 Child care on the occasion of the inauguration 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.760
 The day care center was next to the dedicated ones 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.200
 co- workers of the freisinger brk also the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.300
 President of the Bavarian red 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.760
 cross appeared and christa 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.220
 princess of thurn and taxis showed 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.620
 very pleased with the new children 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.280
 Terminal in the visitor's park of Munich 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.690
 aIRPORT 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.540
 the children have a beautiful 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.730
 play space outside and can 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.900
 could observe planes in the sky 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.940
 watch traffic 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.250
 I think the location a bit 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.290
 in the middle of life as the children are 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.920
 expected later and something 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.590
 I believe the house as inside 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.230
 a very successful device very the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
 requirements corresponding to these 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.760
 Requirements belong at an airport 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.410
 like the Munich at the three of four 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.740
 employed in shift work 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.170
 are 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.810
 also flexible and long opening times 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.160
 the kita am airport is the parents of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.900
 Monday to Friday 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.200
 even on holidays 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.990
 from 6 o'clock in the morning until 21 o'clock in the evening 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.910
 disposal 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.980
 Of course, that also corresponds to ours 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.600
 shift times here at least for the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.640
 both core layers of the early layer and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500
 the late shift 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.950
 the parents have a lot at the end now 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.510
 Much easier if you have children 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.390
 that they can work at the same time 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
 can deliver your children here and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.870
 sure they are a very good one 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.750
 it was old 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.770
 quarters up to 30 airport hops the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.450
 found space here 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.300
 so can the offer with the new 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.520
 Buildings can be extended to 48 places 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.710
 not just the employees of the airport 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.330
 mÃ¼nchen gmbh but employed by 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.160
 airlines authorities and others at 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.260
 Airport based company 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.890
 can look after your offspring here 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.100
 to let 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.480
 and if it's in the new bigger one 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.760
 Daycare become too tight again 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.250
 should this not be a problem then 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.580
 the modular designed building can be located in 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.720
 be easily extended in this case 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.730
 However, the question remains whether the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.160
 airport hops in times of 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 demographic change might also 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.060
 a specialist reserve for the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.800
 airport of tomorrow 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.240
 important, of course, is now completely important 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.640
 professional child care 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.200
 but I do not mind at all 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.660
 we have that kids big here 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.610
 have become or rather childhood 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.050
 Of course you have spent later too 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.730
 start here 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.440
 they will always remember 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.620
 Going back saying I'm tall 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.620
 become
