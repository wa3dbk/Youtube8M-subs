there's more and more pressure to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
there's more and more pressure to
provide<00:00:50.190> better<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.670> better<00:00:50.820> accommodation

and<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> content<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> boats

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and the content of that is that boats

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.810 
and the content of that is that boats
have<00:00:54.000> become<00:00:54.360> bigger<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.469> heavier<00:00:55.820> taller

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
have become bigger and heavier taller

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.869 
have become bigger and heavier taller
whatever<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.770> ended<00:00:58.770> by<00:00:58.980> product<00:00:59.430> sometimes

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
whatever and ended by product sometimes

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.990 
whatever and ended by product sometimes
the<00:01:00.030> handling<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> performance<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.859> suffer

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
the handling and performance can suffer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
the handling and performance can suffer
so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.600> great<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.379> boat<00:01:04.650> much

so the great thing about this boat much
to<00:01:05.489> my<00:01:05.640> amazement<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.720> isn't<00:01:06.960> true

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to my amazement is that just isn't true

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
to my amazement is that just isn't true
in<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.439> case<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.640> boat<00:01:08.880> has<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> handling

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
trickery going on with the doors here

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:43.890 
trickery going on with the doors here
which<00:02:34.080> makes<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.709> little<00:02:35.130> bit<00:02:35.370> special

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.309

want real extra space in this cabin you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.490 
want real extra space in this cabin you
shut<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:57.150> secondary<00:02:58.150> door<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:59.260> all

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
shut this secondary door and you all

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.289 
shut this secondary door and you all
this<00:02:59.739> extra<00:03:00.010> corridor<00:03:00.459> space<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.879> absorbed

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
this extra corridor space is absorbed

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.270 
this extra corridor space is absorbed
into<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.540> cabinet<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:01.989> really<00:03:02.319> does<00:03:02.530> make<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
into the cabinet it really does make the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.009 
into the cabinet it really does make the
cabin<00:03:03.549> feel<00:03:03.849> an<00:03:03.970> awful<00:03:04.299> lot<00:03:04.420> bigger<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> bit

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
cabin feel an awful lot bigger and a bit

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:12.850 
cabin feel an awful lot bigger and a bit
special

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.140 

as<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.099> see<00:03:14.250> there's<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> bit<00:03:14.610> more<00:03:14.640> door

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
as you can see there's a bit more door

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.030 
as you can see there's a bit more door
trickery<00:03:15.599> going<00:03:15.689> on<00:03:15.989> here<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:16.290> well<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.680> think

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
trickery going on here as well I think

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.559 
trickery going on here as well I think
we<00:03:17.159> have<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.400> face<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.790> fact<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.060> even<00:03:18.450> on

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
we have to face the fact that even on

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.410 
we have to face the fact that even on
these<00:03:18.719> really<00:03:19.379> big<00:03:19.760> sports<00:03:20.760> cruisers<00:03:21.269> or

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
these really big sports cruisers or

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.119 
these really big sports cruisers or
sports<00:03:21.930> bridge<00:03:22.260> whatever<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.709> want<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.920> call

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
sports bridge whatever you want to call

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.399 
sports bridge whatever you want to call
them<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:24.060> fact<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.450> an<00:03:24.959> awful<00:03:25.230> lot<00:03:25.319> of

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
them the fact is that an awful lot of

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.740 
them the fact is that an awful lot of
them<00:03:25.680> will<00:03:25.829> be<00:03:25.950> used<00:03:26.189> as<00:03:26.579> day<00:03:27.269> boats<00:03:27.540> or

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
them will be used as day boats or

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
them will be used as day boats or
weekenders<00:03:28.379> so<00:03:28.560> there<00:03:28.709> won't<00:03:28.829> be<00:03:28.980> perhaps

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
weekenders so there won't be perhaps

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.910 
weekenders so there won't be perhaps
that<00:03:29.609> much<00:03:29.819> cooking<00:03:30.299> going<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.689> so<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.709> makes

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
that much cooking going on so it makes

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.649 
that much cooking going on so it makes
an<00:03:32.010> awful<00:03:32.159> lot<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.400> sense<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.760> able<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:33.030> hive

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
an awful lot of sense to be able to hive

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.020 
an awful lot of sense to be able to hive
off<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.019> galley<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.500> keep<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.579> private<00:03:35.790> so

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
off the galley and keep it private so

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.640 
off the galley and keep it private so
these<00:03:36.299> doors<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.689> think<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.989> nice<00:03:37.170> extra

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
these doors I think in a nice extra

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.520 
these doors I think in a nice extra
feature<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.750> see<00:03:39.900> down<00:03:40.109> here<00:03:40.139> in<00:03:40.439> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
feature as you can see down here in the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.990 
feature as you can see down here in the
engine<00:03:40.769> room<00:03:40.799> even<00:03:41.189> with<00:03:41.340> these<00:03:41.459> biggest

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
engine room even with these biggest

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.119 
engine room even with these biggest
engines<00:03:42.359> in<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> 1280<00:03:43.349> m2<00:03:43.920> use

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
engines in here the 1280 m2 use

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.250 
engines in here the 1280 m2 use
absolutely<00:03:44.970> acres<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.629> space<00:03:45.840> around<00:03:46.079> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
absolutely acres of space around the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.520 
absolutely acres of space around the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
engines for good service access quite

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.559 
engines for good service access quite
like<00:03:49.859> Sun<00:03:50.430> seekers<00:03:50.790> approach<00:03:51.120> to

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
like Sun seekers approach to

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.300

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.089 
change but the really outstanding thing
about<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:56.970> boat<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.479> its<00:04:57.690> handling<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.470> this

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
fun to drive and I think in these days

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.570 
fun to drive and I think in these days
with<00:05:06.620> accommodation<00:05:07.620> making<00:05:07.979> boats<00:05:08.190> bigger

with accommodation making boats bigger

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
and fatter and more corpulent I think

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.030 
and fatter and more corpulent I think
that's<00:05:10.949> really<00:05:11.430> quite
