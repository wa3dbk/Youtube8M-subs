00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.710 
loaded which become a legend to be
honest<00:03:26.609> i'll<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:26.880> talk<00:03:26.940> about<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:27.540> a

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
honest i'll just talk about this for a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.509 
honest i'll just talk about this for a
little<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.829> can<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.129> gameplay

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
little bit and you can see the gameplay

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.670 
little bit and you can see the gameplay
in<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.639> background<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.019> reason<00:03:31.379> is

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
in the background and the reason is

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.349 
in the background and the reason is
because<00:03:31.950> there's<00:03:32.310> more<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.639> a<00:03:32.790> demand<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.269> the

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
because there's more of a demand for the

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.729 
because there's more of a demand for the
child<00:03:33.599> secret<00:03:33.930> i<00:03:33.959> rode<00:03:34.169> in<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.379> man<00:03:34.500> city

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
career mode i also i think that's a

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.720 
career mode i also i think that's a
problem<00:03:37.319> with<00:03:37.560> YouTube<00:03:37.859> yesterday<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.250> bloated

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.580 
problem with YouTube yesterday I bloated
on<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:40.519> twenty-eighth<00:03:42.199> so<00:03:43.199> if<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.349> go<00:03:43.440> back

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
on the twenty-eighth so if you go back

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.319 
on the twenty-eighth so if you go back
to<00:03:43.739> their<00:03:43.889> night<00:03:44.129> if<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.519> come<00:03:44.549> upload<00:03:45.000> videos

to their night if you come upload videos
and<00:03:45.480> go<00:03:45.569> back<00:03:45.780> you'll<00:03:46.769> see<00:03:46.980> they<00:03:47.129> didn't<00:03:47.340> get

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and go back you'll see they didn't get

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.920 
and go back you'll see they didn't get
many<00:03:47.549> views<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:48.000> reckon<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.389> because<00:03:48.599> YouTube

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930

i'm basically loading every once every
two<00:04:17.099> days<00:04:17.250> because<00:04:17.459> everybody<00:04:18.299> twice<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.840> well

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
two days because everybody twice as well

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.229 
two days because everybody twice as well
because<00:04:19.289> i<00:04:19.380> wanted<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.680> see<00:04:19.859> if<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:21.090> was<00:04:21.180> just

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
because i wanted to see if it was just

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.209 
because i wanted to see if it was just
one<00:04:21.389> video<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.959> pink<00:04:22.620> looks<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:23.039> thought

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
one video that pink looks really thought

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.890 
one video that pink looks really thought
for<00:04:23.400> sure<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.580> was<00:04:23.760> bugged<00:04:24.150> out<00:04:24.330> or<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.599> wanted

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
for sure that was bugged out or I wanted

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.260 
for sure that was bugged out or I wanted
to<00:04:24.990> see<00:04:25.080> if<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.320> was<00:04:25.469> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
to see if it was the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.790 
to see if it was the
chip<00:04:27.629> itself<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.020> think<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.229> YouTube<00:04:28.530> itself

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
chip itself I think is YouTube itself

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.740 
chip itself I think is YouTube itself
because<00:04:29.190> both<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.639> videos<00:04:29.940> did<00:04:30.120> badly<00:04:30.330> and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
because both of the videos did badly and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.930 
because both of the videos did badly and
i'm<00:04:31.289> a<00:04:31.319> assuming<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:32.729> probably

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
i'm a assuming that is just probably

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.809 
i'm a assuming that is just probably
because<00:04:33.389> it's<00:04:34.009> EG<00:04:35.009> bugging<00:04:35.340> out<00:04:35.460> like<00:04:35.669> it

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
because it's EG bugging out like it

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.670 
because it's EG bugging out like it
sometimes<00:04:36.000> does<00:04:36.569> which<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:36.900> been<00:04:37.169> annoying<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
sometimes does which is been annoying I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.680 
sometimes does which is been annoying I
know<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:38.639> I<00:04:38.699> actually<00:04:38.940> I'm<00:04:39.300> actually<00:04:39.449> excited

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
know but I actually I'm actually excited

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.749 
know but I actually I'm actually excited
