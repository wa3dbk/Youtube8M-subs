00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this module we will see how 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.319
 insert a flash animation into a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
 html page 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 then we will do the layout of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.920
 this flash animation with text and 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 images 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.550
 I will start by retrieving the text 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.600
 I get the text cycle I copy 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.900
 the content I just stick it in my 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:35.690
 page like this I'm going to do the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.690
 level 1 water level headers 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.530
 I will now insert an image a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.890
 picture I choose to fall picture as 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:57.480
 this and I will write the text 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:59.129
 secondary this is this picture does for 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 the moment no style rule I him 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:08.119
 apply the right blog class rule 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.119
 like this 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:20.140
 then we will place an animation 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.200
 flash in the bottom of our document I 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.090
 will select the flash animation 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.460
 here i'm going to take swf and in my 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.880
 different documents I'm going to recover 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.620
 the swf file which is the animation 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.050
 which can be put online not to 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.920
 to confuse with the f is there who is the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.010
 work file 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.610
 native of flash this nyon election 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:52.570
 files and I validated I'm going from 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:56.229
 call it drop like this by default 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.420
 this animation is pretty big too 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.140
 great even for the size of our page 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.229
 so we will reduce this animation 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.820
 has a smaller size and to keep 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.619
 the homo taissy to keep the report 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.600
 width height i'm going to maintain the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:18.370
 capital key pressed during the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:20.800
 reduction like this i'm going after him 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:29.350
 apply a class that will be here 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:33.100
 left blog here we go so 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.360
 now launch the preview 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.360
 in a browser 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.680
 the browser 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.670
 during the first export of the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.830
 flash file automatically generates 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.540
 javascript files that will us 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.910
 allow to install and read 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.740
 animation without problems this being 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:03.500
 particularly useful for the internet 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:05.020
 explore this is our animation 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.090
 flash 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.140
 nevertheless we see that the top of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.870
 the animation the part of the sky and white 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.150
 we might want to delete this 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.730
 overview so as to make sure that 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.670
 this animation are done more in 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.300
 our page we will do it 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.300
 now 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.959
 for that I will select 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.630
 the flash animation and on the panel of 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.320
 property where he wrote 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:46.070
 wmode instead of easter I will choose 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:48.950
 transparent I will launch the preview in 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.280
 the browser to check if my 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.530
 animation has become transparent 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.650
 now we do not see anymore 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.090
 top 2 of the flash document the top of the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.090
 document has blended into the page 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.840
 we have it so we are at the end of 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.340
 our module insertion of an animation 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.540
 flash and layout 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.540
 in a html document
