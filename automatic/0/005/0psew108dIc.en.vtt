00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
game is where you can do that and that's

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.730

why<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.429> like<00:01:48.789> going<00:01:48.970> through<00:01:49.450> there<00:01:49.659> as<00:01:49.899> one<00:01:50.709> of

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
why I like going through there as one of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.469 
why I like going through there as one of
two<00:01:51.280> fliers<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.170> actually<00:01:53.380> well

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
two fliers because you can actually well

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.419 
two fliers because you can actually well
fly<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.539> safety<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.289> case<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.679> miss<00:01:56.890> your<00:01:57.100> jump

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.669 

and<00:02:00.429> that<00:02:00.729> takes<00:02:01.030> care<00:02:01.209> of<00:02:01.270> act<00:02:01.569> 1<00:02:01.690> I'm<00:02:02.140> hoping

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
and that takes care of act 1 I'm hoping

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.029 
and that takes care of act 1 I'm hoping
to<00:02:02.860> do<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.190> upside<00:02:04.000> down<00:02:04.240> an<00:02:04.450> all<00:02:04.600> around

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
to do that upside down an all around

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.520 
to do that upside down an all around
area<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:07.500> level<00:02:08.820> while<00:02:09.820> running<00:02:10.530> because

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
area of this level while running because

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.340 
area of this level while running because
I<00:02:12.130> made<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> point<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:13.359> before<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.989> selfie
