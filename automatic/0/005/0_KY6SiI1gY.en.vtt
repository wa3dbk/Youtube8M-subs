back the neck goes way through like all
the<00:01:05.820> attitude<00:01:06.000> basis<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> actually<00:01:06.900> went

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the attitude basis but we actually went

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
the attitude basis but we actually went
in<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.799> angle<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.580> guess<00:01:09.119> there's<00:01:09.299> some

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
in at an angle here I guess there's some

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.940 
in at an angle here I guess there's some
patented<00:01:09.869> new<00:01:09.990> Yamaha<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:10.890> do

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
patented new Yamaha thing that they do

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
patented new Yamaha thing that they do
and<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.549> pulls<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> end<00:01:12.390> grain<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and it actually pulls the end grain to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
and it actually pulls the end grain to
the<00:01:12.780> neck<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> slot<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.159> end

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the neck up into the slot of the end

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310

grain<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> body<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> they

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
grain of the body and they and they

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690 
grain of the body and they and they
combine<00:01:16.619> together<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.460> actually

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
combine together and you can actually

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
combine together and you can actually
loosen<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> play<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> bass<00:01:18.750> try<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.409> and

loosen and play the bass try it out and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.780 
loosen and play the bass try it out and
see<00:01:19.860> how<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.979> feels<00:01:20.189> tighten<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
see how it feels tighten them up and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.560 
see how it feels tighten them up and
it's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> quantum<00:01:21.630> leap<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:23.299> springiness<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's a quantum leap of springiness and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's a quantum leap of springiness and
aliveness<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:25.860> were<00:01:26.070> doing<00:01:26.280> the

aliveness and they also were doing the

that's what they Saudis made out of so
it's<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> relict<00:01:38.880> wood<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it's not really a relict wood but it's

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's not really a relict wood but it's
it's<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.650> aged<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.430> guess<00:01:41.579> officially<00:01:41.820> eight

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's just aged I guess officially eight

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
it's just aged I guess officially eight
so<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:43.049> determine<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so it's they determine some of the the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
so it's they determine some of the the
sap<00:01:45.149> crystallizes<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> some<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> wood

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
sap crystallizes in some of the wood

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
sap crystallizes in some of the wood
various<00:01:47.549> things<00:01:47.729> happen<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> over<00:01:48.390> time

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
various things happen to it over time

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
various things happen to it over time
and<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.229> were<00:01:49.710> able<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.100> mimic<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and they they were able to mimic that in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
and they they were able to mimic that in
this<00:01:51.360> process<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> wood<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.799> it's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this process they do on the wood so it's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.260 
this process they do on the wood so it's
a<00:01:53.009> pretty<00:01:53.220> awesome<00:01:53.310> sounding<00:01:53.909> bass<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
a pretty awesome sounding bass when I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.639 
a pretty awesome sounding bass when I
first<00:01:54.509> got<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.869> played<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.320> three

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
first got it I played it for about three

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.520 
first got it I played it for about three
hours<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> Hipshot<00:01:58.049> D<00:01:58.229> tuner

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
hours and it's got the Hipshot D tuner

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.819 
hours and it's got the Hipshot D tuner
of<00:01:58.649> course<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.159> all<00:01:59.520> my<00:01:59.640> bases<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
of course on all my bases this was a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.670 
of course on all my bases this was a
prototype<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> nut<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:04.049> low<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
prototype so the nut is a little low so

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.929 
prototype so the nut is a little low so
I<00:02:04.710> haven't<00:02:04.920> had<00:02:05.070> time<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> fix<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.759> put<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
I haven't had time to fix it so I put a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
I haven't had time to fix it so I put a
little<00:02:06.090> piece<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.329> paper<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> erase

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
little piece of paper in there to erase

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.339 
little piece of paper in there to erase

actually do my own custom set which is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.280 
actually do my own custom set which is
the<00:02:19.450> basic<00:02:19.810> rotosound<00:02:20.530> strings<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.760> RS<00:02:22.750> 66

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the basic rotosound strings the RS 66

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.620 
the basic rotosound strings the RS 66
but<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> g-string<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.000> at<00:02:25.150> forty<00:02:25.420> three

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
but we do the g-string is at forty three

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.210 
but we do the g-string is at forty three
instead<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.050> forty<00:02:26.319> five<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.740> little<00:02:27.130> bit

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
instead of a forty five a little bit

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.270 
instead of a forty five a little bit
lighter<00:02:27.400> little<00:02:27.940> easier<00:02:28.300> Bend<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:30.069> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
lighter little easier Bend and in the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.580 
lighter little easier Bend and in the
east<00:02:30.610> ring<00:02:30.880> as<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> 110<00:02:31.600> instead<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.959> 105

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
east ring as a 110 instead of 105

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.340 
east ring as a 110 instead of 105
so<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:32.980> actually<00:02:33.239> evens<00:02:34.239> out<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.420> string<00:02:35.260> to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
so it actually evens out the string to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.740 
so it actually evens out the string to
string<00:02:35.440> tension<00:02:35.830> across<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.760> scale<00:02:37.569> of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
string tension across the scale of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.270 
string tension across the scale of
tension<00:02:38.110> from<00:02:38.290> from<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> g<00:02:38.860> string<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> e

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
tension from from the g string to the e

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.860 
tension from from the g string to the e
string<00:02:39.580> actually<00:02:40.000> evens<00:02:40.360> out<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.480> little<00:02:40.720> bit

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
string actually evens out a little bit

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.970 
string actually evens out a little bit
better<00:02:40.989> makes<00:02:41.500> them<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> little<00:02:41.830> bit<00:02:41.920> more

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
better makes them a little bit more

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.009 
better makes them a little bit more
uniform<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.760> that's<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.060> quick<00:02:43.450> summary<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
uniform so that's a quick summary of the

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.240 
uniform so that's a quick summary of the
base<00:02:44.530> I'm<00:02:44.709> using<00:02:44.739> line<00:02:45.160> six<00:02:46.350> Wireless<00:02:47.350> line

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
base I'm using line six Wireless line

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.340 
base I'm using line six Wireless line
six<00:02:48.489> brought<00:02:48.670> out<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.030> X<00:02:49.630> wire<00:02:49.900> digital

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
six brought out the X wire digital

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.979 
six brought out the X wire digital
wireless<00:02:50.470> company<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:51.910> were<00:02:52.209> legendary

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
wireless company and they were legendary

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.420 
wireless company and they were legendary
Wireless<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.590> now<00:02:53.709> line<00:02:54.070> six<00:02:54.340> is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
Wireless so now line six is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.030 
Wireless so now line six is
manufacturing<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.410> same<00:02:56.650> circuitry

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
manufacturing that that same circuitry

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.259 
manufacturing that that same circuitry
I've<00:02:57.340> ended<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.580> bit<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.970> problem<00:02:58.239> that

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
I've ended a bit of problem that

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.210 
I've ended a bit of problem that
anywhere<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:58.870> been<00:02:58.989> awesome<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.500> that's<00:03:00.100> my

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
anywhere it's been awesome so that's my

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.100 
anywhere it's been awesome so that's my
base<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.550> wireless<00:03:00.850> you'll<00:03:01.239> see<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.540> pedal

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
base and wireless you'll see that pedal

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.220 
base and wireless you'll see that pedal
board<00:03:02.319> over<00:03:02.530> there<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:03.730> basically<00:03:04.230> Taurus

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
board over there it's basically Taurus

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.330 
board over there it's basically Taurus
pedals<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.600> different<00:03:08.050> format<00:03:08.440> it's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
pedals but in a different format it's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.300 
pedals but in a different format it's
the<00:03:09.489> same<00:03:09.700> idea<00:03:09.880> as<00:03:11.100> basically<00:03:12.100> MIDI

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the same idea as basically MIDI

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.059 
the same idea as basically MIDI
triggered<00:03:12.730> pedals<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:14.350> trigger<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.830> little

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
triggered pedals and I trigger a little

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.490 
triggered pedals and I trigger a little
synth<00:03:15.310> here<00:03:15.579> it's<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.880> role<00:03:16.269> in<00:03:17.549> Sonic<00:03:18.549> cell<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
synth here it's a role in Sonic cell and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.720 
synth here it's a role in Sonic cell and
I<00:03:20.500> could<00:03:20.650> switch<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.860> programs<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.640> get

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
I could switch to programs and get

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.800 
I could switch to programs and get
different<00:03:21.880> sounds<00:03:22.239> for<00:03:22.299> different<00:03:22.540> things

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
different sounds for different things

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.870 
different sounds for different things
it<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.320> helps<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.950> when<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.340> use<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.610> drill

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
the old svt's in the OL in the early

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.599 
the old svt's in the OL in the early
days<00:04:07.000> they<00:04:07.180> don't<00:04:07.269> have<00:04:07.480> anymore<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
days they don't have anymore and the the

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.960 
days they don't have anymore and the the
speakers<00:04:10.030> are<00:04:10.239> put<00:04:10.480> into<00:04:10.950> metal<00:04:11.950> wood<00:04:12.579> nuts

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
speakers are put into metal wood nuts

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.849 
speakers are put into metal wood nuts
that<00:04:13.209> are<00:04:13.269> that<00:04:13.600> are<00:04:13.660> clamped<00:04:14.350> into<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.680> wood

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
that are that are clamped into the wood

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.890 
that are that are clamped into the wood
so<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.280> wood<00:04:15.519> screws<00:04:15.900> arbitrarily

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
so it is just wood screws arbitrarily

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.420 
so it is just wood screws arbitrarily
jammed<00:04:17.320> into<00:04:17.530> plywood<00:04:18.010> they're<00:04:18.220> really

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
mounted properly so I'm really impressed

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.760 
mounted properly so I'm really impressed
the<00:04:20.859> quality<00:04:21.220> control<00:04:21.430> on<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.000> Harkey<00:04:22.330> stuff

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770

for my high end my Pierce preamp is
still<00:04:37.990> here<00:04:38.200> I've<00:04:38.350> got<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:39.190> think<00:04:39.430> 3<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:40.030> these

amps<00:05:21.550> okay<00:05:21.760> so<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.270> one<00:05:22.450> pickups<00:05:22.840> go<00:05:22.990> into<00:05:23.290> the

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
amps okay so so one pickups go into the

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.890 
amps okay so so one pickups go into the
top<00:05:24.220> set<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.640> amps<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.150> now<00:05:25.240> two<00:05:25.300> pickups<00:05:25.750> come

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
top set of amps and now two pickups come

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.240 
top set of amps and now two pickups come
to<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.050> bottoms<00:05:26.290> exactly<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:26.860> therefore<00:05:27.220> I

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
to the bottoms exactly so therefore I

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.220 
to the bottoms exactly so therefore I
need<00:05:27.280> to<00:05:27.580> wireless<00:05:28.000> isn't<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.480> to<00:05:28.810> everything

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
need to wireless isn't to to everything

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.350 
need to wireless isn't to to everything
basically<00:05:29.680> it's<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.640> little<00:05:30.850> bit<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.090> pain<00:05:31.270> in

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
basically it's a little bit of a pain in

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.160 
basically it's a little bit of a pain in
the<00:05:31.390> neck<00:05:31.450> but<00:05:31.600> still<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.640> lot<00:05:33.640> of<00:05:33.670> other

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
the neck but still a lot of other

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.300 
the neck but still a lot of other
companies<00:05:35.170> in<00:05:35.440> instrument<00:05:35.860> said<00:05:35.980> dunno<00:05:36.160> the

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
companies in instrument said dunno the

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.070 
companies in instrument said dunno the
Rickenbacker<00:05:36.700> hricko<00:05:37.000> sound<00:05:37.390> that's<00:05:37.690> double

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
Rickenbacker hricko sound that's double

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.500 
Rickenbacker hricko sound that's double
pick<00:05:38.230> up<00:05:38.350> to<00:05:38.500> two<00:05:38.650> dual<00:05:39.520> output<00:05:39.910> all<00:05:40.270> the

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
pick up to two dual output all the

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.390 
pick up to two dual output all the
original<00:05:40.900> Olympic<00:05:41.110> basses<00:05:41.650> had<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.950> double

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
original Olympic basses had the double

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.430 
original Olympic basses had the double
output<00:05:42.550> as<00:05:42.790> well<00:05:42.970> so<00:05:43.450> it's<00:05:43.720> not<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:43.930> completely

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
output as well so it's not a completely

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.160 
output as well so it's not a completely
crazy<00:05:44.680> idea<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.220> in<00:05:45.790> practice<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.990> works

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
crazy idea and in practice it works

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.960 
crazy idea and in practice it works
really<00:05:47.440> well<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.860> always<00:05:48.340> keep<00:05:48.550> low-end

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
really well to always keep low-end

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.310 
really well to always keep low-end
happening<00:05:49.390> no<00:05:49.480> matter<00:05:49.630> what<00:05:49.840> else<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.080> going

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
happening no matter what else is going

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.230 
happening no matter what else is going
on<00:05:50.410> so<00:05:50.650> it's<00:05:51.070> always<00:05:51.220> a<00:05:51.340> super<00:05:51.700> deep<00:05:51.850> low-end

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
on so it's always a super deep low-end

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.230 
on so it's always a super deep low-end
amp<00:05:52.480> pushing<00:05:53.320> air<00:05:53.980> around<00:05:54.460> locking<00:05:55.030> it<00:05:55.120> with<00:05:55.210> a

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
amp pushing air around locking it with a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.760 
amp pushing air around locking it with a
bass<00:05:55.420> drum<00:05:55.450> so<00:05:55.900> whatever<00:05:56.200> other<00:05:56.440> shenanigans

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
bass drum so whatever other shenanigans

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.970 
bass drum so whatever other shenanigans
are<00:05:57.130> going<00:05:57.310> on<00:05:57.430> we're<00:05:57.880> doing<00:05:58.060> okay<00:05:58.980> alright

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
are going on we're doing okay alright

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.130 
are going on we're doing okay alright

Billy well I think thank you so much for

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.540 
Billy well I think thank you so much for
taking<00:06:02.230> us<00:06:02.410> through<00:06:02.590> our<00:06:02.710> your<00:06:03.040> rig<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.490> it

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
taking us through our your rig and it

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.300 
taking us through our your rig and it
seems<00:06:03.790> a<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.960> seems<00:06:05.230> it<00:06:05.470> looks<00:06:05.680> complicated<00:06:06.040> I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
seems a it seems it looks complicated I

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.680 
seems a it seems it looks complicated I
guess<00:06:06.490> but<00:06:06.700> it's<00:06:06.850> you<00:06:06.940> know<00:06:07.060> pretty<00:06:07.390> straight

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
guess but it's you know pretty straight

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.330 
guess but it's you know pretty straight
ahead<00:06:07.780> one<00:06:08.080> one<00:06:08.470> output<00:06:08.620> here<00:06:08.890> when<00:06:09.070> I<00:06:09.100> put

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
ahead one one output here when I put

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.640 
ahead one one output here when I put
there<00:06:09.490> so<00:06:09.850> it<00:06:10.540> all<00:06:10.660> somehow<00:06:10.960> makes<00:06:11.290> sense<00:06:11.500> in

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
there so it all somehow makes sense in

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.260 
there so it all somehow makes sense in
the<00:06:11.740> end<00:06:11.770> so<00:06:12.100> that's<00:06:12.580> that's<00:06:12.850> what<00:06:12.970> matters

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
the end so that's that's what matters

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.550 
the end so that's that's what matters
thanks<00:06:13.720> ray<00:06:13.840> well<00:06:13.990> thank<00:06:14.140> you<00:06:14.230> so<00:06:14.350> much
