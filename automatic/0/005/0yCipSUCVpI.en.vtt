obviously<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.549> damage<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.770> diamonds

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
obviously and the damage so diamonds

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.390 
obviously and the damage so diamonds
diamond<00:01:26.340> sword<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> damage<00:01:27.030> value<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:28.400> 1562

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
diamond sword has a damage value of 1562

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.179 
diamond sword has a damage value of 1562
so<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> thousand<00:01:30.299> 561<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.920> that's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so if you do a thousand 561 then that's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.350 
so if you do a thousand 561 then that's
a<00:01:32.400> thousand<00:01:32.900> 561<00:01:33.900> -<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> thousand<00:01:35.369> 562

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
a thousand 561 - from the thousand 562

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
a thousand 561 - from the thousand 562
so<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.110> dark<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so it's a bit dark and if we get like a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.719 
so it's a bit dark and if we get like a
pig<00:01:38.909> spawn<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.360> something<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.079> boom<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.560> we

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
pig spawn or something here boom and we

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.249 
pig spawn or something here boom and we
down<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.270> durability<00:01:42.750> left<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
down has one durability left and if you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.050 
down has one durability left and if you
do<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.159> gone<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> one

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
do that then it's gone because the one

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
do that then it's gone because the one
Jubilee<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.540> finished<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.530> basically

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
Jubilee is finished so that's basically

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
Jubilee is finished so that's basically
how<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.310> works<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> stuff<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.270> you're

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
how that works and stuff if you're

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
how that works and stuff if you're
getting<00:01:48.869> loads<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.320> blocks<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.740> once<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.340> say

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
getting loads of blocks at once so say

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
getting loads of blocks at once so say
you're<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.119> selected<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.409> doesn't

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you're you selected this one it doesn't

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.929 
you're you selected this one it doesn't
matter<00:01:52.799> where<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.950> select<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> select

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
matter where you select so if you select

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
matter where you select so if you select
there<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.990> click<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.290> every<00:01:55.890> single

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
there and you can click on every single

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.260 
there and you can click on every single
one<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.310> them<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.060> keep

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
one of them and they will just keep

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
one of them and they will just keep
going<00:01:57.540> forward<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.890> just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.690 
keeps on going and if you wondering what
the<00:02:01.200> difference<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.740> between<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.130> waters<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the difference is between the waters and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.249 
the difference is between the waters and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the lava is basically one of them is

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.899
