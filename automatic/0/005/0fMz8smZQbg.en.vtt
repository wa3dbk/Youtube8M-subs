and the inner sleeve as you can see is

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.890 
and the inner sleeve as you can see is
like<00:03:44.260> significantly<00:03:45.700> smaller<00:03:46.700> like<00:03:47.030> there's

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
like significantly smaller like there's

virtually nothing on the top that is

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.910 
virtually nothing on the top that is
maybe<00:03:50.750> like<00:03:50.900> one<00:03:51.080> millimeter<00:03:51.470> on<00:03:51.590> each<00:03:51.709> side

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
maybe like one millimeter on each side

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.770 
maybe like one millimeter on each side
like<00:03:52.190> it's<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> lot<00:03:52.519> tighter<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.420> official

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
like it's a lot tighter the official

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.420 
like it's a lot tighter the official
