it to do it won't last forever be or

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.170 
it to do it won't last forever be or
last<00:05:50.839> for<00:05:50.990> quite<00:05:51.139> a<00:05:51.169> long<00:05:51.349> time<00:05:51.909> then<00:05:52.909> we<00:05:53.060> can

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
last for quite a long time then we can

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.279 
last for quite a long time then we can
do<00:05:53.330> a<00:05:53.360> double<00:05:53.659> lift<00:05:54.279> and<00:05:55.279> we<00:05:55.400> can<00:05:55.610> do<00:05:55.759> a<00:05:56.289> color

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
do a double lift and we can do a color

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.959 
do a double lift and we can do a color
change<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.979> does<00:05:58.129> a<00:05:58.159> lot<00:05:58.370> of<00:05:58.520> these<00:05:58.699> that

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
change and it does a lot of these that

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.399 
change and it does a lot of these that
there<00:05:59.089> is<00:05:59.180> no<00:05:59.479> problems<00:05:59.990> with<00:06:00.139> this<00:06:00.199> deck

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
there is no problems with this deck

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.499 
there is no problems with this deck
really<00:06:00.770> a<00:06:00.800> problem<00:06:01.099> it's<00:06:01.190> very<00:06:01.219> slippery<00:06:01.879> but

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
really a problem it's very slippery but

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:03.670 
really a problem it's very slippery but
I'm<00:06:02.629> guessing<00:06:02.839> that's<00:06:03.110> just<00:06:03.319> because<00:06:03.440> maybe

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
I'm guessing that's just because maybe

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.740 
I'm guessing that's just because maybe
it's<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.979> heat<00:06:04.129> or<00:06:04.550> maybe<00:06:05.029> it's<00:06:05.240> just<00:06:05.300> me<00:06:05.629> I'm

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
it's the heat or maybe it's just me I'm

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.839 
it's the heat or maybe it's just me I'm
not<00:06:05.930> too<00:06:06.110> sure<00:06:06.319> but<00:06:06.560> it's<00:06:07.009> very<00:06:07.219> slippery<00:06:07.520> when

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
not too sure but it's very slippery when

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.430 
not too sure but it's very slippery when
I<00:06:07.879> try<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.150> spring<00:06:08.839> it<00:06:08.960> compared<00:06:09.289> to<00:06:09.349> the

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
I try to spring it compared to the

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.040 
I try to spring it compared to the
orange<00:06:09.589> this<00:06:10.009> one's<00:06:10.219> very<00:06:10.339> slippery<00:06:10.810> may<00:06:11.810> just

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
orange this one's very slippery may just

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.379 
orange this one's very slippery may just
be<00:06:12.169> me<00:06:12.379> but<00:06:12.409> my<00:06:13.069> deck<00:06:13.339> appears<00:06:13.759> to<00:06:13.909> be<00:06:14.029> that<00:06:14.180> way
