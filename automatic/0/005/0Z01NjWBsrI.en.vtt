00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
important part yeah this is this is very

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.179 
important part yeah this is this is very
important<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:53.170> build<00:01:53.409> this<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.710> and

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
important so if you build this up and

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.709 
important so if you build this up and
then<00:01:55.829> deep<00:01:56.829> freeze<00:01:57.130> someone<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:58.600> gonna

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
then deep freeze someone you're gonna

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.440 
then deep freeze someone you're gonna
hit<00:01:59.079> him<00:01:59.229> hard<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.130> what<00:02:00.429> I<00:02:00.610> was<00:02:00.969> trying<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.299> do

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
hit him hard so what I was trying to do

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.600 
hit him hard so what I was trying to do
in<00:02:01.719> battlegrounds<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.710> wasn't<00:02:03.159> working<00:02:03.280> very

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
in battlegrounds it wasn't working very

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.690 
in battlegrounds it wasn't working very
well<00:02:03.700> because<00:02:04.380> there's<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.500> lot<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.740> disbalance

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
well because there's a lot of disbalance

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.109 
well because there's a lot of disbalance
right<00:02:07.149> now<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.569> think<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.679> think<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.429> balance

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
right now I think I think it's a balance

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.509 
right now I think I think it's a balance
issue<00:02:10.569> right<00:02:10.899> now<00:02:10.959> it's<00:02:11.260> not<00:02:11.349> anything<00:02:12.190> else

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
issue right now it's not anything else

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.720 
issue right now it's not anything else
but<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.730> was<00:02:13.060> getting<00:02:13.420> locked<00:02:13.750> out<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.610> my

was<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.780> scooch<00:02:35.319> Pam<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.010> then<00:02:36.760> keep<00:02:37.060> by

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
was to just scooch Pam and then keep by

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.020 
was to just scooch Pam and then keep by
our<00:02:37.690> team<00:02:38.040> charged<00:02:39.040> up<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.970> much<00:02:40.359> as<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.660> could

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
our team charged up as much as I could

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.949 
our team charged up as much as I could
so<00:02:43.030> yeah<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.470> would<00:02:44.680> move<00:02:44.859> I<00:02:45.160> will<00:02:45.280> move

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
so yeah so we would move I will move

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.080 
so yeah so we would move I will move
with<00:02:46.959> scorch<00:02:47.560> then<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.670> getting<00:02:48.850> in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
with scorch then when I was getting in

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.660 
with scorch then when I was getting in
range<00:02:49.359> arcane<00:02:49.900> blast<00:02:50.079> that's<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.069> third<00:02:51.310> stack

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
range arcane blast that's a third stack

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.830 
range arcane blast that's a third stack
and<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:54.100> for<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.579> full<00:02:54.790> stack<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.450> would<00:02:55.690> do

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and then for the full stack I would do

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.440 
and then for the full stack I would do
the<00:02:55.959> fourth<00:02:56.230> fourth<00:02:56.950> stack<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.549> frost<00:02:58.090> Joe

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
the fourth fourth stack and frost Joe

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.250 
the fourth fourth stack and frost Joe
and<00:02:58.720> try<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.410> get<00:02:59.739> at<00:02:59.889> the<00:03:00.040> deep<00:03:00.549> freeze<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:02.230> I

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
and try to get at the deep freeze but I

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
and try to get at the deep freeze but I
normally<00:03:02.799> never<00:03:02.950> worked<00:03:04.200> never<00:03:05.200> worked

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
normally never worked never worked

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.860 
normally never worked never worked
I<00:03:07.650> took<00:03:08.650> too<00:03:08.950> long<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.130> do<00:03:09.370> my<00:03:09.550> last<00:03:10.060> one<00:03:10.600> but

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
I took too long to do my last one but

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.330 
I took too long to do my last one but
it's<00:03:11.020> still<00:03:11.200> it's<00:03:11.440> still<00:03:11.709> crit<00:03:12.240> so<00:03:13.240> yeah

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
it's still it's still crit so yeah

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.820 
it's still it's still crit so yeah
arcane<00:03:16.770> again<00:03:17.770> for<00:03:18.310> sure<00:03:18.490> seems<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.940> lot<00:03:19.150> more

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
arcane again for sure seems a lot more

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.559 
arcane again for sure seems a lot more
reliable<00:03:20.830> for<00:03:21.040> PvP<00:03:21.430> then<00:03:21.640> then<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.270> was<00:03:22.390> in

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
reliable for PvP then then it was in

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.380 
reliable for PvP then then it was in
Cataclysm<00:03:23.170> but<00:03:23.410> I'm<00:03:24.190> not<00:03:24.430> sure<00:03:25.620> exactly<00:03:26.620> how

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
Cataclysm but I'm not sure exactly how

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.479 
Cataclysm but I'm not sure exactly how
reliable<00:03:28.390> is<00:03:28.600> gonna<00:03:28.810> be<00:03:29.050> for<00:03:29.590> PvP<00:03:30.010> how<00:03:30.250> good

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
reliable is gonna be for PvP how good

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.570 
reliable is gonna be for PvP how good
it's<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.880> in<00:03:31.450> theory<00:03:32.050> it<00:03:32.319> sounds<00:03:32.890> and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
it's going to be in theory it sounds and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.250 
it's going to be in theory it sounds and
it<00:03:33.670> looks<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.360> could<00:03:34.569> really<00:03:34.840> blow

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
it looks like you could really blow

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.170 
it looks like you could really blow
someone<00:03:35.739> up<00:03:35.770> in<00:03:36.069> one<00:03:36.280> deep<00:03:36.550> freeze<00:03:36.880> that's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
someone up in one deep freeze that's

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.509 
someone up in one deep freeze that's
crazy<00:03:37.600> like<00:03:38.220> that's<00:03:39.220> that's<00:03:39.519> insane<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:41.519> yeah

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
crazy like that's that's insane so yeah

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.630 
crazy like that's that's insane so yeah
I<00:03:42.850> think<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.810> had<00:03:43.959> some<00:03:44.140> potential<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.340> I

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
I think you had some potential but I
