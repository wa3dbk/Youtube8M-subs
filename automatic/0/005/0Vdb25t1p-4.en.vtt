00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.049
 and with friends on youtube as they are 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.149
 I hope they are very well and good today 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.880
 I bring this new video with a small 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.240
 pretty interesting whole comparative 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.910
 which is something pro neglect and what is the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.370
 pro web version of the appstore like eric 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.920
 I was going to bring you this video and well now 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.680
 I bring them here as you can see I have 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.070
 here the two applications mainly 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.289
 you can notice a small difference in 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.590
 what icons are like 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.140
 appreciate there 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.260
 if the icon and slightly larger in 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.480
 comparison to the raptor iguanas is what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.090
 that they could identify the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.020
 difference 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.020
 However 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.050
 As you can see, the ico is not the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.969
 same 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.739
 and that's why they might think that 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.220
 there's a lot of difference that actually if 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 there is 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.760
 let's teach let's go on these 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.780
 moments to access the application of the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.089
 app store and how can you see the interface 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.770
 if they have entered into apathy it is quite 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.549
 similar but it's actually 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.380
 very different since this one does not really 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.179
 works the same in this there are not many 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.340
 dictionaries as you can see in each 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.950
 they appear to you which has diction to which 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.350
 no and it's specifically used for 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.719
 check the security of your modem but 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.939
 you have to have the model data in 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.259
 comparison with the laziness that you have left 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.670
 of the data so to speak so 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.429
 well there you can see what 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.200
 it has to be first to verify 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:44.009
 would be to select a router that is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.009
 well yours 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.610
 and later you can ask for the ss 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.159
 which is the name of the address model 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.530
 brand 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.300
 these moments because I do not have them to the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 hand but 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.810
 can you try it if they buy the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.850
 application 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 then they have to put the year of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.980
 rhythm of and automatically it's going to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.910
 calculate without any 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.910
 problem 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.580
 well that's practically how it works 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.230
 As I say, it's not good for hacking 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.230
 now we are going to enter into apathy 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.740
 and there as you can see in this is the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.660
 interface as I say is practically 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.120
 the same only that in this shows us 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.340
 other information here you can see that 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.930
 detects networks the only thing we have 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.640
 what to do is select the network that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.730
 we want to hack or move the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.500
 key 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.590
 and later we just have to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.930
 put him on start and it's pretty much everything 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.590
 what we have to do here is going to 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.200
 give the password as soon as the exploits 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.450
 they have done their work within the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.450
 network and as you can see it already gave me connection 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.050
 a little notification and well there 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.940
 we have the key also as you can see 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.830
 the application is not optimized yet 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.380
 for iphone 5 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.970
 of fifth generation but it works 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.160
 pretty good in this case we 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.560
 we can download other dictionaries 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.660
 from cydia and so we could capture 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.920
 anything will do a test 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.920
 entering itunes 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.670
 It is a little slow because the network is 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.670
 remote 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.450
 basically that's it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.269
 but I'll leave the test for another 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.730
 as you can see the network and the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.879
 I have available and this would be 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.400
 basically everything is the applications I 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.500
 I recommend that you do not buy it to wash 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.769
 store that costs 13 pesos in boston 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.220
 Mexican, since as I say, it does not 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:15.260
 much more useful than for those who 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.260
 your network security matters a lot 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.910
 and it will be your final decision if 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.270
 they want to buy it or not, I recommend 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:29.640
 the more he decided that he has more profits 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.640
 it depends a lot so this would be all
