everybody<00:01:44.460> owns<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:45.060> nude<00:01:45.540> post<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.259> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
everybody owns a nude post by now but I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920 
everybody owns a nude post by now but I
haven't<00:01:47.159> owned<00:01:47.549> any<00:01:47.790> yet<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.780> my

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

I was totally really really awkward in
the<00:02:35.790> beginning<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.050> started<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.440> like
