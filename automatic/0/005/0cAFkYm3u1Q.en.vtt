00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that we use in all the restaurants I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.100 
that we use in all the restaurants I
just<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.110> olive<00:01:19.650> oil<00:01:19.970> water<00:01:21.110> lemon

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
just made out of olive oil water lemon

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
just made out of olive oil water lemon
juice<00:01:22.290> salt<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.040> pepper<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.610> water<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
juice salt and pepper we put water in

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.190 
juice salt and pepper we put water in
there<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.450> lightens<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.020> sort

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
there because it just lightens this sort

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
there because it just lightens this sort
of<00:01:25.229> richness<00:01:25.560> available<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> becomes

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
of richness available and it becomes

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.330 
of richness available and it becomes
less<00:01:26.909> ploy<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.049> top<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> palate<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
less ploy on the top of the palate so it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.469 
less ploy on the top of the palate so it
becomes<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:29.700> easier<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.299> we're<00:01:30.420> just

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
becomes a lot easier and we're just

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.679 
becomes a lot easier and we're just
going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> finish<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:32.090> potatoes<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689

freshly<00:01:33.930> great<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.350> seems<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:34.890> weird

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
freshly great now that seems a bit weird

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
freshly great now that seems a bit weird
because<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> plastic<00:01:35.909> bottle<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.540> that
