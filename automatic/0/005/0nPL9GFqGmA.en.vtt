so<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.930> story<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.350> that<00:00:01.380> if<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:02.159> have<00:00:02.370> an<00:00:02.669> old

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so the story is that if you have an old

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.079 
so the story is that if you have an old
mechanical<00:00:03.330> camera<00:00:03.689> like<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.790> chances<00:00:05.790> are

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
mechanical camera like this chances are

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.020 
mechanical camera like this chances are
its<00:00:06.480> shutter<00:00:07.109> over<00:00:08.040> time<00:00:08.280> as<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.700> springs

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
its shutter over time as the springs

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.660 
its shutter over time as the springs
where<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.240> have<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.750> been<00:00:09.929> getting<00:00:10.610> more<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
where I have just been getting more and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.509 
where I have just been getting more and
more<00:00:11.880> inaccurate<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:13.230> tend<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> lose<00:00:14.040> your

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
more inaccurate you tend to lose your

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.660 
more inaccurate you tend to lose your
top<00:00:14.820> speeds<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.619> slow<00:00:16.859> speeds<00:00:17.220> either

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
top speeds and the slow speeds either

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.390 
top speeds and the slow speeds either
are<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.449> slow<00:00:18.690> or<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.260> don't<00:00:20.070> happen<00:00:20.160> at

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
are really slow or they don't happen at

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.390 
are really slow or they don't happen at
all<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:21.990> take<00:00:22.170> your<00:00:22.320> old<00:00:22.500> camera<00:00:23.039> or

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
all and you can take your old camera or

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
all and you can take your old camera or
shutter<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:23.730> whatever<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.720> camera<00:00:25.109> repair

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
shutter or whatever to a camera repair

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
shutter or whatever to a camera repair
person<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.949> they<00:00:26.010> will<00:00:26.160> use<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.640> this

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
person and they will use like this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.740 
person and they will use like this
really<00:00:27.660> sophisticated<00:00:29.330> piece<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> test

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
really sophisticated piece of test

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.049 
really sophisticated piece of test
equipment<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.500> verify<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.640> actual

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
equipment to verify what your actual

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.920 
equipment to verify what your actual
shutter<00:00:33.360> speeds<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:34.070> but<00:00:35.070> that's<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.430> chumps

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
shutter speeds are but that's for chumps

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.630 
shutter speeds are but that's for chumps
so<00:00:36.930> there's<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.350> few<00:00:37.920> approaches<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so there's a few approaches that you can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.020 
so there's a few approaches that you can
take<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.960> classic

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
take to do this the classic

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.549 
take to do this the classic
do-it-yourself<00:00:42.030> method<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> light

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
do-it-yourself method is to get a light

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
do-it-yourself method is to get a light
sensor<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> put<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.700> pair<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.030> wires<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
sensor and put it on a pair of wires and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
sensor and put it on a pair of wires and
then<00:00:45.870> use<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.079> computer<00:00:46.649> sound<00:00:46.950> card<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
then use your computer sound card is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.500 
then use your computer sound card is
kind<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> hack<00:00:48.329> together

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
kind of like a hack together

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
kind of like a hack together
oscilloscope<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.160> basically<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.640> make

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
oscilloscope you can basically like make

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.389 
oscilloscope you can basically like make
a<00:00:50.820> recording<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> sound<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.410> use

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
a recording of the sound and then use

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
a recording of the sound and then use
the<00:00:53.610> sound<00:00:53.820> card<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> recording

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the sound card or use the recording

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.689 
the sound card or use the recording
software<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> figure<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:55.980> exactly<00:00:56.129> how<00:00:56.460> long

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
software to figure out exactly how long

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.299 
software to figure out exactly how long
the<00:00:56.879> impulse<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.859> too<00:00:58.890> easy

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the impulse was but that's way too easy

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.069 
the impulse was but that's way too easy
and<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> doesn't<00:01:00.180> let<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.570> use<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> your

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and it doesn't let you make use of your

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.369 
and it doesn't let you make use of your
fancy<00:01:01.530> toys<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
fancy toys so what we're gonna do is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.010 
fancy toys so what we're gonna do is
shine<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.100> laser<00:01:06.260> through<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.530> camera<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
shine a laser through the camera and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.880 
shine a laser through the camera and
onto<00:01:10.159> this<00:01:11.159> photodiode<00:01:12.260> then<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.590> really

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
onto this photodiode then this is really

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.130 
onto this photodiode then this is really
primitive<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:15.150> accurate<00:01:15.689> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
primitive and not very accurate or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.679 
primitive and not very accurate or
precise<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.880> good<00:01:18.240> enough<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.630> our

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
precise but it's good enough for our

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.640 
precise but it's good enough for our
purposes<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.060> ye<00:01:21.060> olde<00:01:21.270> five<00:01:22.140> five<00:01:22.409> five

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
purposes this is ye olde five five five

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.539 
purposes this is ye olde five five five
timer<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:24.000> real<00:01:24.210> classic<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
timer it's real classic it's just a

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
timer it's real classic it's just a
semiconductor<00:01:26.549> IC<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.650> supply<00:01:29.100> with

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
semiconductor IC that you supply with

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
semiconductor IC that you supply with
one<00:01:30.180> capacitor<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.500> see<00:01:31.650> there

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
one capacitor which you can see there

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
one capacitor which you can see there
right<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.070> middle<00:01:32.420> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> obscured<00:01:33.900> by

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
right in the middle kind of obscured by

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.590 
right in the middle kind of obscured by
a<00:01:34.049> wire<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.729> supply<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.360> two

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a wire and you supply it with two

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
a wire and you supply it with two
resistors<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> outputs<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:39.950> periodic

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
resistors and it outputs a periodic

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.179 
resistors and it outputs a periodic
signal<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> fairly<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:42.210> fixed<00:01:43.189> steady

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
signal at a fairly good fixed steady

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.850 
signal at a fairly good fixed steady
rate<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.530> gonna<00:01:46.680> work

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
rate so again the way this is gonna work

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.069 
rate so again the way this is gonna work
is<00:01:47.100> we've<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> laser<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:48.899> be

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
is we've got the laser and it's gonna be

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
is we've got the laser and it's gonna be
shining<00:01:49.409> onto<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> camera<00:01:50.070> shutter<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> then

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
shining onto the camera shutter and then

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.660 
shining onto the camera shutter and then
when<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> camera<00:01:52.409> shutter<00:01:52.590> opens<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.399> its

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
when the camera shutter opens for its

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
when the camera shutter opens for its
instantaneous<00:01:54.240> exposure<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.219> photodiode

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
instantaneous exposure the photodiode

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
instantaneous exposure the photodiode
will<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.240> lit<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> other<00:01:57.930> side<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
will be lit up on the other side and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.429 
will be lit up on the other side and
what<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> Arduino<00:01:59.610> will<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.439> nothing

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
what the Arduino will do is nothing

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.920 
what the Arduino will do is nothing
until<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.520> notices<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> photodiode<00:02:03.479> light<00:02:03.750> up

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
until it notices the photodiode light up
and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> duration<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.880> the

photodiode<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.659> hot<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.819> start<00:02:09.090> counting

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
photodiode is hot it will start counting

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.220 
photodiode is hot it will start counting
the<00:02:09.780> pulses<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> five<00:02:11.280> five<00:02:11.520> five<00:02:11.760> timer

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the pulses from the five five five timer

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
the pulses from the five five five timer
I<00:02:13.260> was<00:02:13.440> gonna<00:02:13.590> kick<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.010> ten<00:02:14.400> thousand<00:02:14.819> pulses

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
I was gonna kick out ten thousand pulses

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.030 
I was gonna kick out ten thousand pulses
a<00:02:15.209> second<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.230> you're<00:02:16.440> camera<00:02:16.680> shutter

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
a second so if you're camera shutter

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.850 
a second so if you're camera shutter
speed<00:02:17.340> was<00:02:17.519> say<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:18.659> at<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.440> thousandth

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
speed was say one at one one thousandth

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
speed was say one at one one thousandth
of<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.010> second<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.489> would<00:02:20.610> expect<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> register

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
of a second we would expect to register

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.960 
of a second we would expect to register
about<00:02:21.959> ten<00:02:22.230> pulses<00:02:22.709> from<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> timer<00:02:23.700> during

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
about ten pulses from the timer during

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.259 
about ten pulses from the timer during
that<00:02:24.620> exposure<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.760> reason<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.120> we're

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
that exposure the reason that we're

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.229 
that exposure the reason that we're
using<00:02:27.420> an<00:02:27.629> external<00:02:27.959> timer<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:29.239> in

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
using an external timer is because in

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.729 
using an external timer is because in
some<00:02:30.450> cases<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.780> proves<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.290> more<00:02:31.530> accurate

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
some cases it proves to be more accurate

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.460 
some cases it proves to be more accurate
than<00:02:32.400> their<00:02:33.209> Arduino<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.690> built<00:02:34.319> in

than their Arduino is built in
microsecond<00:02:35.190> timing<00:02:35.750> function<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.260> kind<00:02:37.470> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
microsecond timing function it's kind of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.949 
microsecond timing function it's kind of
weird<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.209> use<00:02:39.239> your<00:02:39.720> own

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
weird but all if you use your own

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.600 
weird but all if you use your own
external<00:02:40.319> timer<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.920> attach<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.519> an

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
external timer and attach it as an

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.039 
external timer and attach it as an
interrupt<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.209> then<00:02:42.299> count<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.659> pulses

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
interrupt and then count the pulses

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.319 
interrupt and then count the pulses
sometimes<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.069> get<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> better<00:02:44.579> result<00:02:44.849> than

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
sometimes you get a better result than

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.640 
sometimes you get a better result than
if<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.780> were<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.230> call<00:02:46.500> them

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
if you were just to call them

if you were just to call them
microseconds<00:02:47.280> function<00:02:47.640> directly<00:02:50.420> we're

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
microseconds function directly we're

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.699 
microseconds function directly we're
gonna<00:02:51.540> play<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.019> oscilloscope<00:02:52.319> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
gonna play with the oscilloscope a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.789 
gonna play with the oscilloscope a
little<00:02:52.950> um<00:02:53.370> I'll<00:02:54.090> touch<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.930> probe<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
little um I'll touch the the probe of

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.530 
little um I'll touch the the probe of
the<00:02:55.950> oscilloscope<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.849> output<00:02:57.239> from<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the oscilloscope to the output from the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.660 
the oscilloscope to the output from the
timer<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.230> let's<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.069> what<00:02:59.250> we<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
timer and let's see what we get on the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.180 
timer and let's see what we get on the
graph<00:02:59.879> here<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:03.379> from<00:03:04.379> this<00:03:04.500> display<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.980> can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
graph here so from this display you can

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.630 
graph here so from this display you can
see<00:03:05.599> horizontally<00:03:06.599> it's<00:03:07.319> taking<00:03:07.739> one<00:03:08.190> two

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
see horizontally it's taking one two

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.550 
see horizontally it's taking one two
three<00:03:09.239> four<00:03:10.069> five<00:03:11.359> marks<00:03:12.359> on<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.569> grid<00:03:12.840> for<00:03:13.379> it

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
three four five marks on the grid for it

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.920 
three four five marks on the grid for it
to<00:03:13.680> complete<00:03:14.040> an<00:03:14.129> entire<00:03:14.280> pulse<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.299> over

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
to complete an entire pulse and over

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.059 
to complete an entire pulse and over
here<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.319> says<00:03:16.560> what<00:03:17.069> 20<00:03:17.599> microseconds<00:03:18.599> per

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
here it says what 20 microseconds per

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.979 
here it says what 20 microseconds per
grid<00:03:20.069> line<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:21.630> 100<00:03:22.169> microseconds<00:03:22.859> per

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
grid line so that's 100 microseconds per

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.509 
grid line so that's 100 microseconds per
cycle<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.829> 10,000<00:03:26.549> Hertz<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:28.519> just

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
cycle and that is 10,000 Hertz and just

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.530 
cycle and that is 10,000 Hertz and just
for<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.819> heck<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.419> can<00:03:32.209> I'm<00:03:33.209> if<00:03:33.389> we

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
for the heck of it you can I'm if we

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.379 
for the heck of it you can I'm if we
zoom<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> waveform<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:36.239> can

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
zoom out on the on the waveform we can

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.120 
zoom out on the on the waveform we can
see<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.840> holds<00:03:36.989> pretty<00:03:37.319> much<00:03:37.530> constantly

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
see that it holds pretty much constantly

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.909 
see that it holds pretty much constantly
what<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.700> look<00:03:38.849> at<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> bottom<00:03:39.919> bottom

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
what if you look at the bottom bottom

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.559 
what if you look at the bottom bottom
lines<00:03:41.130> even<00:03:41.489> after<00:03:42.380> about<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.440> dozen<00:03:44.569> cycles

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
lines even after about a dozen cycles

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.170 
lines even after about a dozen cycles
that<00:03:45.750> still<00:03:46.079> stays<00:03:46.349> pretty<00:03:46.889> dang<00:03:47.220> accurate<00:03:48.000> so

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
that still stays pretty dang accurate so

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.539 
that still stays pretty dang accurate so
this<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.480> probably<00:03:48.900> within<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.519> two

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
this is probably within you know two

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
percent of 10,000 Hertz which is plenty

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.539 
percent of 10,000 Hertz which is plenty
accurate<00:03:54.660> for<00:03:54.989> tiny<00:03:55.440> cameras<00:03:58.340> okay<00:03:59.340> let's

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
accurate for tiny cameras okay let's

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.750 
accurate for tiny cameras okay let's
activate<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.000> laser<00:04:00.560> okay<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.340> laser<00:04:02.519> is

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
activate the laser okay and the laser is

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.390 
activate the laser okay and the laser is
shining<00:04:03.090> through<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.359> lens<00:04:03.680> and

shining through the lens and

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.440 
shining through the lens and
here<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.510> mr.<00:04:06.810> photodiode<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.430> here's<00:04:09.150> one

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
here is mr. photodiode so here's one

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
and it just kicks it out over the serial

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:19.640 
and it just kicks it out over the serial
port

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650

right<00:04:21.810> here<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.350> 33<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.600> 34<00:04:25.100> if<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.190> do<00:04:26.460> enough

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
right here so 33 and 34 if you do enough

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.969 
right here so 33 and 34 if you do enough
of<00:04:26.910> these<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:28.250> can<00:04:29.250> start<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.789> build<00:04:30.000> up<00:04:30.979> an

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
of these you can start to build up an

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.920 
of these you can start to build up an
actual<00:04:32.370> graph<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:35.039> for<00:04:35.310> all<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.729> trouble<00:04:35.940> we

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
actual graph and for all that trouble we

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.469 
actual graph and for all that trouble we
can<00:04:37.110> see<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.650> at<00:04:38.460> about<00:04:38.699> one<00:04:39.030> second<00:04:41.479> the

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
can see that at about one second the

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.290 
can see that at about one second the
camera<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:42.900> pretty<00:04:43.080> accurate<00:04:43.289> but

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
camera is pretty accurate but

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.500 
camera is pretty accurate but
predictably<00:04:45.300> as<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.870> shutter<00:04:46.080> speeds<00:04:46.410> go<00:04:46.590> up

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
predictably as the shutter speeds go up

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
predictably as the shutter speeds go up
whoa<00:04:48.510> look<00:04:48.990> at<00:04:49.080> that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
whoa look at that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.760 
whoa look at that
it's<00:04:49.919> losing<00:04:50.760> accuracy<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.870> for<00:04:52.680> that

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
it's losing accuracy so for that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.040 
it's losing accuracy so for that
particular<00:04:52.979> lens<00:04:53.430> it's<00:04:53.910> two<00:04:54.240> fastest<00:04:54.720> speeds

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
particular lens it's two fastest speeds

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
particular lens it's two fastest speeds
are<00:04:55.289> actually<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> little<00:04:56.220> bit<00:04:56.400> slow
