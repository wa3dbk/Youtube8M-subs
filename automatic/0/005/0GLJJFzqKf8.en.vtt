00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.929
 It is the first video in a long series of videos 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.409
 I hope to be 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.409
 percent we are starting a video game company 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.949
 This is the third time 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.449
 who tried it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.140
 and the idea is to make a 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.789
 talk 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.820
 everything we are thinking about what is happening in the process 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 ps2 talking week to week 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.970
 barely three weeks the project started until now is 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.559
 mid-January 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.850
 of 2010 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 an initial objective is that the project covers 18 months in its development phase 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.360
 and who 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.480
 two years or two and a half months 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 of the company and the product as such is said by others 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.219
 I think it's that this material will be interesting 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.890
 so much for video game fans 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.880
 as for people he wants 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.210
 found a video game company 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.630
 I think I would not have 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.900
 interested 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.150
 the path and the process of someone 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.210
 and well, the goal is to document not 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.080
 i practice month 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.120
 iii how are we doing 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 what are we doing week with spa 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.330
 right now 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.480
 I work in a company or bonds is a member of a company 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.520
 according to the information, it is going well 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.080
 popular the conclusion is that this company secures information and 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.420
 partners that I have 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 let's invest 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.480
 in developing a game the ship its 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.810
 is the first part that you have to understand with one is going to develop a game 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.799
 as everyone knows husband -josh they take 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.690
 three or five years 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.690
 develop feelings are develop products 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.690
 he has no income, there is not a single peso 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.550
 that between all is investment all the expense 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.949
 you any 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.949
 who is thinking 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.989
 enter your server games 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.399
 I think the first thing you have to understand very well 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.639
 this commitment with umiko 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.359
 jacques be 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.679
 must have 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.120
 enough money 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.119
 to go out 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.709
 this production 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.629
 if the project will be left in the middle 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.049
 it does not make any sense all the forums 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.509
 I think this is a documentary understand 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:39.739
 how many funds are accessed and with this total resized project 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.709
 suitable for your funds 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.609
 the club is very 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.769
 calculate the expense on the toast 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.129
 very related to the payroll the investment in human resources 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.519
 n 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.599
 they can do nothing tablita and see 4 people think about hiring that the disciplined 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.930
 it is more or less how many are going to pay then multiply by 12 18 and 24 months 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.249
 very large quantities are gathered 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.719
 hello as well as we all know today the teams that do the 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.879
 video game 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.759
 they are very large teams examples we can only have 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.959
 fifty or one hundred people doing a video game 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 all these are the images in a team of 50 people 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.909
 earning or 20 thousand pesos a month on average 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.329
 we are talking about 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.049
 one million pesos each month one million pesos 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.529
 if they put it at 24 months then good 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:34.409
 and I have 24 million pesos a 2 million dollars this is nominal 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.759
 speaking of direct salary then if we wanted to do a project of that 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.869
 we would not be 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.869
 5 8 million dollars in total 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:48.159
 tost in this case we are estimating 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.769
 percent an investment of about one million dollars per week 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.659
 what we are trying to commit to this project in the first 18 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.629
 months 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.159
 developmental 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.019
 and that's good because it fixes us 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.719
 the amounts of limiting our brands and of course not detecting type of things we can 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.649
 become 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.329
 the start vision 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.079
 it enters the operative part 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.589
 josephine present at fitu play 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.449
 we not only believe that 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.989
 I do not think that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.900
 that your market 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.139
 very open 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.020
 is a market where good barge advisers 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.509
 is very low we have 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.610
 millions of users in 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.790
 all with public access basically if its free content simply with 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.039
 generates some interest people can try the game 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.009
 cuautla 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.839
 the pregn is not completely free requires designed 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.639
 a component 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.110
 to be able to charge as fire can continue to be maintained as it is a 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.930
 charity work 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.580
 diferent models 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.680
 economic business models 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.990
 to receive 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.669
 gaming revenue basically the formula is that 100% of the 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.460
 players that there are of people who are playing approximately 10% 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.490
 will be 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.529
 generating 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.769
 some income important to take it four variables of more or less 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.269
 if it is constant if they can invest microtransactions and 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.219
 how much will be the average 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.250
 what will be 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.900
 of investment or of 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.860
 of payment for each user 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.270
 little serious that pays 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.270
 and also the average postpone full even numbers 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.159
 I have some experience developing few commons and liking for 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.860
 third time that my mission 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.669
 It is the second company 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.680
 since he formally founded to make games 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.330
 previous was called radical studios we made a videogame posthumous to polite 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.080
 years 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.589
 siamo summer 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:45.999
 it was the first goal 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.999
 bassiun what player was published in Latin America 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.760
 endesa company not and the project because not how they worked 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.990
 we had to 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.619
 Stop the project 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.139
 but I think he left me a lot
