00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
same as this one over here but I'm not

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.560

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
sure about this one the this one like I

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.170 
sure about this one the this one like I
tried<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> without<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> think<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
tried it without it and so I think it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.130 
tried it without it and so I think it
must<00:02:39.800> be<00:02:40.800> there<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.280> don't<00:02:41.490> know<00:02:41.580> why<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:42.140> maybe

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
must be there I don't know why but maybe

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.980 
must be there I don't know why but maybe
they're<00:02:43.320> supposed<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:44.250> uuid<00:02:44.990> least

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
they're supposed to have like uuid least

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.630 
they're supposed to have like uuid least
and<00:02:46.230> most<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.710> don't<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.430> that's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and most I don't know but that's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.580 
and most I don't know but that's
basically<00:02:47.790> how<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.210> do<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> let<00:02:49.230> me<00:02:49.320> show<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.800 
basically how you do it let me show you
now<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:50.760> are<00:02:50.850> some<00:02:50.910> glitches<00:02:51.270> with<00:02:51.600> this

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
now there are some glitches with this

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.400 
now there are some glitches with this
when<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.500> summon<00:02:53.490> them<00:02:54.260> they<00:02:55.260> are

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
when you first summon them they are

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.140 
when you first summon them they are
indeed<00:02:55.680> leashed<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.080> cannot<00:02:58.440> see<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.890> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
indeed leashed but you cannot see it and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.640 
indeed leashed but you cannot see it and
it's<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.510> kind<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.870> glitchy<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.440> then<00:03:01.530> if

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it's really kind of glitchy and then if

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.010 
it's really kind of glitchy and then if
you<00:03:01.740> like<00:03:02.010> log<00:03:02.310> out<00:03:02.700> log<00:03:03.030> back<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.690> may<00:03:03.900> or
