color<00:00:26.970> because<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.359> thought<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:27.990> very

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
color because I thought this was very

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.749 
color because I thought this was very
fierce<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.250> reminded<00:00:29.669> me<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> book

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759

to<00:00:36.989> paint<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.680> whip<00:00:38.460> which<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:39.960> comes

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to paint a whip which actually comes

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.079 
to paint a whip which actually comes
straight<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.800> book<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.350 

then<00:01:04.440> on<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.920> thumb<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.489> decided<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> paint<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
bit of it on a flat surface

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.960 
bit of it on a flat surface
I<00:01:47.300> took<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:48.110> toothpick<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.160> decided<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.640> create

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
I took a toothpick and decided to create

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.160 
I took a toothpick and decided to create
the<00:01:50.690> chains<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.830> see<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:52.430> my<00:01:52.820> other

fingers

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.940 

what's<00:01:59.090> nice<00:01:59.270> about<00:01:59.330> this<00:01:59.900> is<00:02:00.320> even<00:02:00.740> though

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
what's nice about this is even though

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.640 
what's nice about this is even though
the<00:02:01.400> ring<00:02:01.970> finger<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.540> thumb<00:02:02.810> are<00:02:03.200> very

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
the ring finger and the thumb are very

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.650 
the ring finger and the thumb are very
much<00:02:03.890> related<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.550> book<00:02:04.730> you<00:02:05.300> could<00:02:05.480> take

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
much related to the book you could take

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.840 
much related to the book you could take
the<00:02:05.840> idea<00:02:06.110> for<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.440> chain<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.040> wear<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.310> by

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
the idea for the chain and wear it by

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.460 
the idea for the chain and wear it by
itself<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.780> looks<00:02:08.960> really<00:02:09.440> awesome

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
itself and it looks really awesome

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.660 
itself and it looks really awesome
especially<00:02:10.040> against<00:02:10.910> a<00:02:11.090> black<00:02:11.570> base<00:02:12.230> coat<00:02:12.670> you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
especially against a black base coat you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.610 
especially against a black base coat you
could<00:02:13.790> also<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.330> chain<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.870> gold<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
could also do this chain in gold and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.250 
could also do this chain in gold and
I've<00:02:15.980> seen<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> done<00:02:16.400> other<00:02:17.150> places<00:02:17.570> with

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
I've seen it done other places with

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.560 
I've seen it done other places with
really<00:02:18.830> high-end<00:02:19.310> manicures<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.360> does

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
really high-end manicures so it does

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.860 
really high-end manicures so it does
look<00:02:20.870> pretty<00:02:20.900> classy<00:02:22.000> my<00:02:23.000> last<00:02:23.240> step<00:02:23.510> was<00:02:23.720> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
look pretty classy my last step was to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.230 
look pretty classy my last step was to
take<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.290> toothpick<00:02:24.560> again<00:02:25.100> with<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.670> black

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
take the toothpick again with a black

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.080 
take the toothpick again with a black
polish<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.530> decided<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.040> create<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.640> design

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
polish and I decided to create a design

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.510 
polish and I decided to create a design
on<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.390> tie<00:02:29.570> it's<00:02:29.960> basically<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.370> bunch
