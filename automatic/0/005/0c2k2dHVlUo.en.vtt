00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.000
 Hi everyone, here's a barbarian and I'm going today. 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.360
 talk to you a little bit more about 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.980
 the box of toys or toy box that goes 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 be one of the new features that 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.800
 take with the new expansion the time of the 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.200
 training 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.890
 the toy box is the new system 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.900
 right storage and keeps almost all 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.580
 their cosmetic items and make them 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.040
 linked to account 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.739
 apart from releasing a lot of space in the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.420
 bags and in the banks makes the items 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.640
 added there by most of the time 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.520
 be used by all your 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.300
 account characters this save some 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.230
 exceptions as reputation items is 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.030
 some who require a profession 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.780
 Specifically I'll talk about it with 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.330
 Calm down then there are about 100 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.899
 items in the toy box list 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.119
 today only that they have been changing every pet 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.830
 some are added others are 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.550
 excluded as some examples that I 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.410
 I'll give it to you right away and the breeze will already 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.149
 He said it will vote for chances 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.039
 some things that today are not 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.020
 considered to be toys become 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.630
 and possessed and would be impossible to 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.610
 to be added to this list 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.520
 each item in the toy box she 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.450
 needs to be added to the system only 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.459
 once 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.640
 let's suppose you have the same item 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:45.470
 with two characters which helped 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.170
 stela's daughter turns that stone 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.420
 of return technology 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.270
 if you added it on your tabox a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.950
 She'll be there and in another time. 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.410
 character will she appear to you 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.050
 as already learned with him 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.539
 you do not need to save this item or 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.190
 he adds again and if that 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.009
 you already added it will be accessible 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.229
 for all the same characters example 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.180
 that he is already on my bar he is already 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.160
 considered a toy although it has a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.990
 another on the old could play this one 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.460
 out 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.100
 there is also the possibility that you 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.960
 sets the item as a favorite 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.150
 once you've added the item you 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.950
 Do you want to toy box? Just click with the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.220
 right click on the item that you 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.450
 want to set the 'set 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
 favorite 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.380
 since you set as a favorite 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.990
 it will appear at the top of the list 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.470
 independent of the alphabetical order that is the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.240
 standard toy box organization system 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.160
 so it will always appear in the beginning 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.080
 you can leave the items you 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.470
 likes to use some items there like 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.910
 Examples of the LPN since loads or have 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.190
 cartoons in English 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.870
 and these items can not at first be 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.110
 added in the toy box by the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.450
 least not for now I believe 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.690
 Is not your car going, like in 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.220
 Interesting place that is the item of the country 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.080
 that her boss's name is perennial 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.310
 the one in the middle of the bridge 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.530
 Anyway, he drops it and we call it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.300
 inhabitant that is the core 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.580
 horizon is another voice 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.010
 however they have loads then 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.120
 they can not be added in the box 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.340
 of toys by default the box of 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.000
 Toys shows all items 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 possible are they some that you already 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.580
 have or if you do not have there 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.230
 they are marked here in gray that 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.060
 are the others that you do not have the items 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.320
 colorful sounds you already have and already 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.720
 added 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.640
 if you want to show only items 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.240
 you already have this uncheck the option 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.890
 filter does not collect it will only show 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.250
 the items you've already said in the mass 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.790
 tabox if you check this option do not 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.620
 you will have an effective 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.280
 behind each of these items that 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.380
 they are marked as there is no such 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.480
 this option does not show which teams 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.520
 you have on your character she shows 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.870
 which items have not yet been included in the 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.820
 toy box 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.190
 So I emptied my bank here. 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.049
 literally and I will add several 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.730
 of them here that I have in my 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.370
 toy box and see how I look 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.830

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.140
 your toys 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:05:02.990
 good this item is not a toy it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:05:05.210
 cheated once you click on these 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.160
 toys to add them in the box 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.620
 toys you do not have to worry 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.850
 in to them they are my berg no more 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.470
 the item it is in your carton 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.600
 toys you can continue 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.670
 using it normally when you 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.890
 add a new item to your carton 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.320
 toys it shows a new word 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.180
 on top to know what you add 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.410
 by last if you can arrange a 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.420
 a little better than my collection already 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.250
 not so sure that I 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.380
 I have some more of these items here 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.350
 They're lost somewhere but I'm going 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.150
 find them 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.460
 some items had been added in the 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.690
 list and have been removed in this 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:49.490
 last pet that is the example of what 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.830
 found here in the blessed medallion of 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.310
 carambola this is the nec you make a 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.550
 great string of quests already the hill to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.500
 law is worth of the black moon and some radios 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.710
 of the burn cruise that you create a 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.780
 teleport pro temple black he a 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.530
 principle was a toy box item but 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.210
 it was removed just as the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.430
 dimensional fills that is the 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.030
 dimensional English team I'm not mistaken 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.220
 are the telematics of engineering 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.720
 covering I believe these teleports 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.310
 engineered one shot have been 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.200
 removed because today's engineering 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.540
 It had not been added agronomic 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.590
 this first box bild 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.080
 toys 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.520
 so I believe they will put this 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.849
 a little further ahead but they 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.779
 should 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:37.369
 organize this a little better here 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.229
 now on my list of items 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:40.369
 collected it has already been a little bit 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.919
 bigger 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:46.270
 it was not something from two pages to 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:49.399
 five pages which is very good 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.709
 and so all the toys organized 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:53.389
 I'll show you take these items. 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:56.300
 all who are here who have been 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.029
 added by another character I 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.009
 I can delete them from my bag 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:02.809
 the space that I released in my bank 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.419
 It was a wonderful thing, folks . 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:07.699
 That's because I have not been in the safe yet. 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:10.129
 to deposit my items 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.740
 on the new flap if you have a good 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.509
 new in the ethereal chest for you to put 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.849
 all those items of transhipment that 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.099
 has occupied your seat space 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:22.729
 Look, I got a purse through 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:24.469
 less whole almost two empty pockets 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.599
 because I can add all 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:28.490
 these items in my toy box 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:29.959
 This is it, I hope you guys have 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.399
 understood a little more about these 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:33.709
 functionalities 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:34.999
 if you have any questions about the 

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:37.009
 items will have a link 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:39.229
