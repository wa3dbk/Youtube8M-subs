 hello I am laila monteros and the day of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 Today you see a little bit different video 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.929
 as they were asking me in my 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.849
 social networks I'm going to make the tag I know that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 there's a good wedding at my wedding this is my bag 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.449
 then as I had done before 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 I love to wear black then my 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.529
 bag I could not do it now I'm going to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.359
 teach that there are the secrets of the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.930
 good turn accounts in the bag 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.250
 I always charge my cell phone 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.740
 because it's like more practical my 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 hearing aids that is what takes care 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.040
 later on my cell phone as I had 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.110
 commented before I have like an obsession 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.420
 with the labials I always charge a thousand 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.290
 although I never use them almost a bit of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.300
 change and this cloth to clean them of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.640
 a lake the back is something 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.410
 interesting will not believe the things that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 you find here I bring a brush 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 I always like that I like to be combed 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 Bring us wipes for yourself 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 run to makeup that's always like 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.000
 useful to have wipes and bring my games 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.150
 of the nintendo 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.130
 a little perfume one never knows when 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.380
 will come out then it is necessary in your 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.920
 tapita people always bring sweets 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.960
 I always always bring these I saw 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.940
 palms that are like super specials 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 until later they will know by I bring this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.540
 horn if I get bored is very useful 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.260
 because if you do not know where to put the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.260
 communities 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.100
 a little 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.509
 then there is my portfolio in my portfolio 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.820
 I keep my cards for the money 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.829
 obviously I return the memberships of the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.140
 cinema and those things here keep them with 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.700
 my coupons because fat does not pass 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.460
 paying the same ship these are about 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.649
 habits that I bring if I do some 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.450
 braid or something I put them 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.329
 I bring an equal mirror is very necessary 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.220
 bring a little more effect of 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.909
 moisturizing lipstick that is very good both 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.310
 Hand cream is very important 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.560
 I almost always bring gum because it gives me 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 as anxiety and I am very nervous and I 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.649
 she said she was very nervous 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.539
 so I kind of reassure myself 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.929
 little and good that 's all there is in 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.780
 my bego bag is this then what 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.760
 makes this work until I bring 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.170
 a little bit of equal corrector this is another 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.330
 type of concealer is not a make-up 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.430
 more and this is blogs 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.490
 I do not have more lipsticks and more lipsticks 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.490
 wait I bring this makeup powder 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.290
 It is good to not shine and this that 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.360
 it's before the mascara the black shadow 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.190
 that I bring right now the brochita 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.820
 this and well that's all I bring 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.190
 in my cosmetiquera and in my turn and 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.840
 will tell how everything works that fits in 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.340
 the bag so let's explain more or 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.320
 less as he ordered first go the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.380
 bigger things and the ones that I hardly use 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.990
 be for example the perfume and the kitchen 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.790
 down then I'm putting the food 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.440
 always because it's a bit more to the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.020
 hand but in this meal was the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.420
 labials always always put them in the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 sachet in front I do not always know why 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.560
 what is a custom that has the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.570
 brush or go back and this always 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.070
 I keep in the proposal rib more 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.380
 Little girl that I bring right now 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.420
 never see and then I'm going to put it here but 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.550
 almost always speed bumps and good makeup 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.470
 I always put it all the cosmetics was 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.930
 that all the lipsticks because then well 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.700
 things work and already perspective in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.000
 makeup after same things very 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.160
 needed water as to their jobs 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.190
 and I say it 's important to see how more 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.100
 up because it's like more practical to take 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.230
 the money and good to have as hbo hairlines 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.940
 at hand because then you take out the wallet 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.590
 and can play cartoon 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.050
 good in the same bag in front and 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.240
 good hearing aids and the second cell 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.810
 they should always go together also their 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.730
 dirty and good as the mirror does not 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.770
 It fits in cosmetics were and cream 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.270
 we will keep the same 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.120
 there 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.310
 and already fits all 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.760
 The practical thing about this bag is that if you 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.319
 Tired you can put as a quote 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.480

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.370
