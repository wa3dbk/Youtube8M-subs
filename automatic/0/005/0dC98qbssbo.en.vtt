more<00:01:56.840> evident<00:01:57.079> we<00:01:57.590> were<00:01:57.680> probably<00:01:57.920> going<00:01:58.189> to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
more evident we were probably going to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.760 
more evident we were probably going to
have<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.460> fulfill<00:01:59.450> our<00:01:59.719> end<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.109> the<00:02:00.140> deal<00:02:00.200> and

have to fulfill our end of the deal and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.920 
have to fulfill our end of the deal and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
so I said we were going to have to get

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.929 
so I said we were going to have to get
professional<00:02:03.469> help<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.920> instead<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.729> waiting

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
professional help and instead of waiting
