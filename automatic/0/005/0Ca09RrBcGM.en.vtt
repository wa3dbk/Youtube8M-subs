00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 and 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 now this tutorial on how to play here 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.629
 in cheating flight version and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.410
 This song is in the tone of 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.520
 greater sun and is in the rhythm of bambuco 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.760
 for the point of the first sentence it would be 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760
 is 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 ah 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.149
 and to do this we are going to touch the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.989
 second string open then the third 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.480
 after the first fret we change to the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.470
 third string second fret then 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.620
 first second rope open then 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.600
 third string second fret after 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.000
 this is going to do an arpeggio on the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.119
 chord of the minor we touch which the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.350
 fifth rope on the ground fret 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.619
 fourth agreement on the second fret 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.840
 third string second fret second 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.630
 first fret rope 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.200
 then second open string third 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.229
 fret third string second fret and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.920
 we finish with the third open string 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.920
 the phrase sounds like this 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.590
 and the next sentence would be this 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 to do this we are going to play the fourth 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.540
 rope on the second fret 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.710
 then fifth string third fret 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.900
 we go back to the fourth second block 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.240
 fret then fifth fret fourth fret 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.850
 third string second fret 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.820
 fourth fifth string fret then 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 we do an arpeggio in G major but 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.870
 starting from the fifth string in the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.710
 second fret we play the fifth flowers 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.260
 second fret 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.680
 then the third string the fourth string 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.420
 Open third rope open and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.170
 we finish in the second open string 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.690
 then third string second after 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.569
 second rope first fret we go back to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.170
 the third string second fret 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.280
 then fourth string fourth fret then 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.680
 rope rope open twice and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.200
 then fifth string third fret and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:54.849
 we finish on the second fret 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:57.460
 this phrase sounds so I'm going to play 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.550
 all the slow tapping 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.550
 ah 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.520
 or not 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.680
 and they end up making an agreement of greater sun 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.489
 now the chords for the accompaniment 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.810
 of the singing would be the following I will 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.700
 explain what are the chords of 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.280
 accompaniment of the first verse and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.560
 the first chorus because from there the rest of 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.580
 the song are the same chords but 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.150
 only change the letter 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.150
 start who cheats has turned 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.750
 and then the plucking the chords would be a 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.930
 the minor and then a king seven a re 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.810
 dominant 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.380
 then a greater sun 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.889
 I ask 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.560
 a king 27 then a sun 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.240
 I will explain only the chords of 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.610
 the first verse and the first chorus 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.169
 because the rest of the song is going to 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.479
 repeat the same chords but 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.779
 only will change the font 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:56.190
 chords that I will use will be a minor 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:58.689
 after seven dominant a sun 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.789
 one do more 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:07.169
 then we go to a bigger re then a sun 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.169
 then one of my seven dominant 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.780
 according to the minor 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.780
 37 sunshine 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.840
 ok those are the chords now if 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.680
 we would sing it would be if someone who cheats 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.680
 sour 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.379
 you never told me 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.990
 and then the score now for the chorus the 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:53.550
 chords that I will use will be 17 and then 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:56.700
 my minor then a greater re 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.040
 it's seven dominant we go back to a re 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.130
 higher 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.140
 then we go to a 2 then I would think that 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.720
 a sun 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:10.270
 but only those flavors are we going to use 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.270
 now if we sing it would be like that under 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:41.260
 and then the score goes and well they are all 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.260
 the chords of the singing thank you
