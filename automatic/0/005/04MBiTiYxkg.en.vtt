00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.849
 Hello everyone today we will talk about 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.160
 bench press and technical aspects 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.250
 competitive 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.700
 it is about breaking the barbell from the chest of many 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.279
 there is such a problem directly 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.040
 at competitions or in preparation for 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.700
 competition when it would seem working 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.199
 weight we do reps at 5-6 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.150
 one-time maximum which is pressed on 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:41.290
 rules different from this worker 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:44.900
 maximum kilogram for 10 reasons for this 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.559
 Casus is obvious once trained 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.100
 front deltas due to the peculiarities 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.420
 build a training cycle 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 what is missing in it I will try 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.760
 tell probably not enough 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.489
 technical pause on the chest in 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.670
 normal bench press 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.460
 also rather lack the strength del precisely in 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.880
 bench press many turn out with 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.050
 dumbbells barbell presses standing on 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.110
 sloping bench 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.460
 but it is advisable to do it all the same 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.000
 in relation to the movement in which 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.039
 going to improve the result do 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.349
 pause for every workout while alive I 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.869
 probably it makes no sense that is if we 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.869
 you need to perform 6 repetitions in each of 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.000
 six do a stop on the chest will result 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.940
 before overtraining their overload 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.470
 anterior bundle of deltoid muscle 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.800
 probably probably would be more correct 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.330
 stop at the first repetition 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.050
 the rest are scheduled to do in 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:54.459
 touch is the first version of how 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.459
 you can train the second method 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.110
 for example 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.750
 competitive here is what the usual grip 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.310
 this already increase the front load 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.229
 a bunch of delta and triceps and allow them 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.319
 work more intensively 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.750
 but again not always in touch first 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.580
 held the rest of the touch did 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.190
 this is when we talk about full plate de 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.250
 if we take a partial amplitude you can 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.880
 work only stall i.e. lowering 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 stop to the middle and down stop 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.180
 to the middle down is enough too 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.410
 popularly known reception not especially 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.570
 severely overload elbows again shoulders 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.270
 will be difficult but that's all you can 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.860
 perform without additional equipment just with 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.070
 barbell as in competitions 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.810
 there is another trick that allows 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.720
 increase stall 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.090
 and very noticeable is the work in 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.920
 power frame either here belay 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.090
 stand for squats we have such 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:09.350
 for example bench press with lower point 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 show what exactly to do install 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:18.410
 height so that the bottom 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:22.780
 point bar lay on his chest to get close 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.780
 pony and take the starting position and 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.780
 start 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.660
 every repetition is done after 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.270
 frame stops 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.270
 each repetition gathered and we press 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.990
 get hold of 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.520
 but the reception is quite complicated reception 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.280
 quite complex it is very overloading 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:56.290
 elbow ligaments and baldness ligaments therefore 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.560
 working weights recommend no more than 70 75 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.570
 percent of a one-time maximum is possible 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.420
 include both in the main training 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:08.170
 program so and train this movement 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.180
 first day 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.890
 focusing on restoring your 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.320
 body to not translate it to 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.980
 me overtraining next 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.700
 arrow stagnation next injury be 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:26.440
 attentive to myself further I would like 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.290
 back to the subject of reduced amplitudes 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.650
 there we are constantly taking lessons where 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:39.850
 use for squats bargaining for traction 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:43.270
 pent and for press bar bottles for what 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.570
 all need two aspects 1 of course yes 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.210
 we get used to a large bunch of weights 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.890
 get used big head himself gets used 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.960
 big ourselves what are we doing in 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.340
 principle can theoretically we train 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.890
 central nervous system 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.700
 but another important point that many 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.820
 miss when working with additional equipment 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.950
 it is the development of technical skills 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.390
 there are if there are technical flaws either 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.220
 dead center they are necessarily in 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.370
 every movement in crouching in the press 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.020
 every athlete has this extra 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:23.770
 equipment helps to work with them 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.220
 how for example we break the bar with 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.880
 chest 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.730
 centimeters at 7 she gets stuck like 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.690
 use bars to overcome here 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.150
 this is the weak point we choose the height 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.730
 the bar is slightly lower so that it is less than 7 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.340
 centimeters such as C grade and work 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.740
 with a 3 centimeter bar 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.050
 same on squats just get up 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.050
 wedge from bottom position 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.910
 it usually happens it is 30 degrees 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.800
 in the joint 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.650
 it means we gain height there 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.600
 so that it was just below this position 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.940
 the same in the knee 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.530
 stuck means fingerboard just below the knees 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:11.110
 accumulating traction here with regards to disruption in 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.720
 bench press today explained showed 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.850
 about how it can be implemented 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:21.690
 about the question asked ask answer waiting 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.690
 thank you for your attention bye
