00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
so obviously heavier it's going to throw

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.170 
so obviously heavier it's going to throw
you<00:03:13.730> off<00:03:13.969> your<00:03:13.999> balance<00:03:15.670> strict<00:03:16.670> little<00:03:17.060> more

I<00:03:20.120> actually<00:03:21.079> instead<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.590> slinging<00:03:22.129> this

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
I actually instead of slinging this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.580 
I actually instead of slinging this
carry<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.670> my<00:03:22.760> hands<00:03:22.969> all<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.209> time<00:03:23.409> he<00:03:24.409> should

get the way up on shooters my Creator
Harry<00:03:27.739> my<00:03:27.920> hands<00:03:28.129> all-time<00:03:28.579> had<00:03:28.819> no<00:03:28.969> issues<00:03:29.389> I

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
Harry my hands all-time had no issues I

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.869 
Harry my hands all-time had no issues I
didn't<00:03:30.530> like<00:03:30.709> fatigue<00:03:31.069> my<00:03:31.280> arms<00:03:31.549> or<00:03:31.730> anything

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
didn't like fatigue my arms or anything

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.559 
didn't like fatigue my arms or anything
so<00:03:32.450> they're<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.409> attached<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:33.859> we<00:03:33.980> did<00:03:34.129> like

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
so they're all attached so we did like

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.220 
so they're all attached so we did like
the<00:03:35.569> obstacle<00:03:35.959> course<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:37.689> two<00:03:38.689> for<00:03:38.900> 9<00:03:39.049> was

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
the obstacle course the two for 9 was

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.440 
the obstacle course the two for 9 was
roll<00:03:39.409> heavy<00:03:39.620> bulky<00:03:39.889> and<00:03:40.280> hard<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.209> carry

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
roll heavy bulky and hard to carry

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.890 
roll heavy bulky and hard to carry
around<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.139> I<00:03:42.549> made<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.819> lot<00:03:44.299> more<00:03:44.480> difficult

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
around so I made a lot more difficult

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.589 
around so I made a lot more difficult
than<00:03:45.109> it<00:03:45.169> was<00:03:45.469> as<00:03:45.889> opposed<00:03:46.189> to<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
than it was as opposed to the

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.610 
than it was as opposed to the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
lightweight machine gun which is a lot

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.939

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
lighter easier to carry around and I

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.890 
lighter easier to carry around and I
easier<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.310> maneuver<00:03:52.519> on<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.939> obstacle

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900
