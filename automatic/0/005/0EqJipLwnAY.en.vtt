00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
this bottom portion this is just another

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.479 
this bottom portion this is just another
switch<00:00:40.350> board<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.230> but<00:00:43.489> these

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
switch board that I use here but these

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.680 
switch board that I use here but these
are<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.899> know<00:00:46.489> anywhere<00:00:47.489> between

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
buy them used you may get an even better

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
buy them used you may get an even better
deal<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.120> typically<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.109> I've<00:00:58.289> seen

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
deal but typically that's what I've seen

deal but typically that's what I've seen
them<00:00:58.590> run<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.010> again<00:00:59.789> don't<00:01:00.000> quote<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.329> on

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
them run for again don't quote me on

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.009 
them run for again don't quote me on
that<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.670> it's<00:01:02.670> real<00:01:02.940> simple<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that but it's real simple you just you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.060 
that but it's real simple you just you
can't<00:01:04.199> obviously<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> get

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
can't obviously as you can see you get

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
can't obviously as you can see you get
attached<00:01:05.460> eight<00:01:06.119> different<00:01:06.570> lights<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.110> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
attached eight different lights to this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.620 
attached eight different lights to this
here<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.400> control<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.909> by<00:01:09.119> these

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
here and you control them by these

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.109 
here and you control them by these
switches<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> also<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:11.369> buttons<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.909> what

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
switches and also these buttons if what

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
switches and also these buttons if what
these<00:01:12.360> buttons<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> basically<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
these buttons do is just basically you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
these buttons do is just basically you
push<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.130> it'll<00:01:14.580> power<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.970> whatever<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> have

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
push it it'll power up whatever you have

push it it'll power up whatever you have
plugged<00:01:16.439> into<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.549> let<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:17.939> shuts<00:01:18.630> off

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
plugged into it you let it go shuts off

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010 
plugged into it you let it go shuts off
simple<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.820> mean<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> strobe<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
simple so I mean you want to strobe a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
simple so I mean you want to strobe a
certain<00:01:22.320> type<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> light<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:23.430> long<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
certain type of light as long as you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
certain type of light as long as you
deal<00:01:24.090> without<00:01:24.210> blowing<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> light<00:01:24.840> bulb<00:01:25.080> if

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
deal without blowing the light bulb if

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100 
deal without blowing the light bulb if
they<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.860> light<00:01:26.159> bulbs<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.750> what

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
they have light bulbs but that's what

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.550 
they have light bulbs but that's what
it's<00:01:28.259> for

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it's for

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.710

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
so again simple and cheap solution to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.920 
so again simple and cheap solution to
dmx<00:01:33.979> lights<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.430> also<00:01:36.150> lights<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.810> don't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
dmx lights and also lights that don't

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
dmx lights and also lights that don't
have<00:01:37.170> DMX<00:01:37.799> capabilities<00:01:39.979> okay<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.520> pay<00:01:41.939> no

attention<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> part<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.590> just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
attention to this part here this is just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.929 
attention to this part here this is just
a<00:01:44.340> case<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:46.290> these<00:01:46.560> strips<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.280> okay

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a case that I put these strips in okay

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.600 
a case that I put these strips in okay
but<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> back<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> ez<00:01:49.860> 8<00:01:50.869> like

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
but this is the back of that ez 8 like

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.600 
but this is the back of that ez 8 like
outlet<00:01:53.610> strip<00:01:53.939> by<00:01:54.810> eliminator<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> basically

outlet strip by eliminator and basically
what<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.090> attach<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.659> cable<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:59.329> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
what you do you attach a cable here that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
what you do you attach a cable here that
it<00:02:00.570> comes<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.040> 2<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.490> 2<00:02:02.549> piece<00:02:03.000> set<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
it comes with it's a 2 a 2 piece set and

it comes with it's a 2 a 2 piece set and
you<00:02:04.380> attach<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.299> with<00:02:06.299> these<00:02:06.540> cables

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.750 

and<00:02:10.430> it<00:02:11.120> allows<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.810> control<00:02:12.760> by

attaching this here to that and then

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
attaching this here to that and then
I'll<00:02:17.240> see<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.450> secure<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.840> there<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.320> then

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
I'll see you secure it there and then

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.790 
I'll see you secure it there and then
you<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.750> power<00:02:20.960> coming<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.650> through

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
you have the power coming out through

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.440 
you have the power coming out through
here<00:02:22.300> okay<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.930> attach<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.910> cable<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:29.270> this

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
here okay you attach this cable to this

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.570 
here okay you attach this cable to this
other<00:02:30.430> strip<00:02:31.430> okay<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.960> will<00:02:33.230> go<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.580> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
other strip okay now this will go to the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.170 
other strip okay now this will go to the
trust<00:02:34.910> or<00:02:35.090> whatever<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.480> may<00:02:35.600> have<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
trust or whatever you may have and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
trust or whatever you may have and
basically<00:02:38.180> connect<00:02:38.570> all<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.840> lights<00:02:39.020> you

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
basically connect all the lights you

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.100 
basically connect all the lights you
want<00:02:39.290> as<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:39.770> see<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.370> has<00:02:40.750> eight<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.960> them

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
want as you can see it has eight of them

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.320 
want as you can see it has eight of them
and<00:02:42.290> then<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.890> has<00:02:42.980> an<00:02:43.130> additional<00:02:43.700> one<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:43.910> an

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and then it has an additional one for an

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.230 
and then it has an additional one for an
etch<00:02:44.510> untwist<00:02:45.290> light<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:46.670> maybe<00:02:46.940> if<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.120> have

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
etch untwist light so maybe if you have

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.210 
etch untwist light so maybe if you have
a<00:02:47.350> backlight<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.560> never<00:02:48.680> turn<00:02:48.920> them<00:02:49.070> off

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
a backlight so you never turn them off

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.000 
a backlight so you never turn them off
that<00:02:49.400> could<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.670> an<00:02:50.060> option<00:02:50.270> for<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:51.010> but

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that could be an option for it but

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.370 
that could be an option for it but
otherwise<00:02:52.550> these<00:02:53.060> are<00:02:53.240> your<00:02:53.360> eight<00:02:53.630> lines

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
otherwise these are your eight lines

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.120 
otherwise these are your eight lines
that<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.680> use<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.680> other<00:02:57.830> end<00:02:58.070> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
that you use and that the other end of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.220 
that you use and that the other end of
that<00:02:58.310> one<00:02:58.490> cable<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.630> showed<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.900> goes

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
that one cable that I showed you goes

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.480 
that one cable that I showed you goes
here<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:03.230> only<00:03:03.650> other<00:03:03.860> power<00:03:04.190> you'll

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
here and so the only other power you'll

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.300 
here and so the only other power you'll
need<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.910> here<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.960> virtually<00:03:06.710> you<00:03:06.860> only<00:03:06.980> need

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
need is here so virtually you only need

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.070 
need is here so virtually you only need
one<00:03:07.580> cable<00:03:08.090> running<00:03:08.660> from<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:11.050> strip<00:03:12.050> here<00:03:12.610> to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
one cable running from the strip here to

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.630 
one cable running from the strip here to
the<00:03:15.080> eight<00:03:15.290> lights<00:03:15.590> or<00:03:15.830> maybe<00:03:16.010> nine<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.550> you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
the eight lights or maybe nine that you

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.330 
the eight lights or maybe nine that you
have<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.630> trust<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.860> looks<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.130> lot

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
have to the trust so it looks a lot

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.370 
have to the trust so it looks a lot
neater<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.850> less<00:03:20.120> messy<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.110> like<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> said

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
neater and less messy and like I said

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.810 
neater and less messy and like I said
yeah<00:03:21.680> it's<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.070> DMX

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
yeah it's not DMX

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.450 
yeah it's not DMX
but<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:24.200> still<00:03:24.530> gives<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.950> control<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.280> the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
but it still gives you control of the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.400 
but it still gives you control of the
light<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.000> it's<00:03:26.870> very<00:03:27.440> very<00:03:27.800> very<00:03:28.010> affordable

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
light and it's very very very affordable

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.560 
light and it's very very very affordable
and<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.190> said<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.670> looks<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.240> lot<00:03:32.390> neater

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
and like I said it looks a lot neater

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.990 
and like I said it looks a lot neater
because<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.990> only<00:03:33.110> have<00:03:33.290> one<00:03:33.320> cable<00:03:34.000> actually

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
because you only have one cable actually

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.120 
because you only have one cable actually
yeah<00:03:35.480> one<00:03:35.870> cable<00:03:36.080> running<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:36.830> thing

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
yeah one cable running to this thing

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.370 
yeah one cable running to this thing
with<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.150> exception<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> outlet<00:03:39.110> here

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
with the exception of the outlet here

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.199 
with the exception of the outlet here
but<00:03:39.709> instead<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:40.130> having<00:03:40.370> eight<00:03:40.550> running<00:03:41.090> to

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
but instead of having eight running to

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.780 
but instead of having eight running to
the<00:03:41.300> trust<00:03:41.570> that's<00:03:42.350> all<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.740> is<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.730> I

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the trust that's all it is and like I

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.520 
the trust that's all it is and like I
said<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:44.000> mean<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.480> could<00:03:44.840> attach<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.350> with

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
said I mean you could attach it with

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.210 
said I mean you could attach it with
these<00:03:46.400> uh<00:03:46.900> holes<00:03:47.900> here<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.410> again<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:48.950> use<00:03:49.190> a

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
these uh holes here and again you use a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.550 
these uh holes here and again you use a
clamp<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:50.120> can<00:03:50.270> use<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> bolt<00:03:50.750> whatever<00:03:51.470> you

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
clamp you can use a bolt whatever you

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.440 
clamp you can use a bolt whatever you
want<00:03:51.740> to<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.010> truss<00:03:52.250> or<00:03:52.490> a<00:03:52.580> t-bar<00:03:53.060> or<00:03:53.180> whatever

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
want to the truss or a t-bar or whatever

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.380 
want to the truss or a t-bar or whatever
your<00:03:53.630> preference<00:03:54.020> is<00:03:54.170> or<00:03:55.030> however<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.270> ever

your preference is or however you ever

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.420 
your preference is or however you ever

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
setup and maybe I don't know on a piece

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.740 
setup and maybe I don't know on a piece
of<00:03:58.459> wood<00:03:58.730> or<00:03:58.910> something<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.270> don't<00:03:59.330> know<00:03:59.510> but
