hey i'm justin from JJ longboards and
today<00:00:19.810> i'm<00:00:19.869> going<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.050> review<00:00:20.170> on<00:00:20.590> my<00:00:20.710> set<00:00:20.980> of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
today i'm going to review on my set of

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.179 
today i'm going to review on my set of
venom<00:00:21.550> tweakers<00:00:22.119> these<00:00:22.930> wheels<00:00:23.289> are<00:00:23.590> 70

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
venom tweakers these wheels are 70

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.760 
venom tweakers these wheels are 70
millimeters<00:00:24.610> tall<00:00:24.939> they<00:00:25.539> have<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.689> width<00:00:25.960> of<00:00:26.110> 44

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
millimeters tall they have a width of 44

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.269 
millimeters tall they have a width of 44
millimeters<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.579> a<00:00:28.000> contact<00:00:28.570> patch<00:00:28.839> of<00:00:29.279> kind

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
millimeters and a contact patch of kind

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.360 
millimeters and a contact patch of kind
of<00:00:30.429> small<00:00:30.670> 37<00:00:31.420> millimeters<00:00:32.100> I'm<00:00:33.100> going<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.309> be

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
of small 37 millimeters I'm going to be

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.530 
of small 37 millimeters I'm going to be
completely<00:00:33.730> honest<00:00:34.030> with<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:34.269> I<00:00:34.330> haven't

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
completely honest with you I haven't

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.180 
completely honest with you I haven't
written<00:00:34.660> this<00:00:34.870> wheel<00:00:35.140> all<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.530> way<00:00:35.890> down<00:00:36.160> to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
written this wheel all the way down to

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.650 
written this wheel all the way down to
give<00:00:36.519> you<00:00:36.640> an<00:00:36.760> opinion<00:00:37.000> on<00:00:37.269> what<00:00:37.420> it's<00:00:37.540> like

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
give you an opinion on what it's like

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.780 
give you an opinion on what it's like
when<00:00:37.839> you're<00:00:37.989> writing<00:00:38.140> um<00:00:38.440> almost<00:00:39.220> completely

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
when you're writing um almost completely

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.729 
when you're writing um almost completely
wore<00:00:39.970> down<00:00:40.150> on<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:40.420> wheel<00:00:40.570> but<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.440> think<00:00:41.620> I've

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
wore down on the wheel but I think I've

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.860 
wore down on the wheel but I think I've
written<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.070> long<00:00:42.250> enough<00:00:42.400> and<00:00:42.820> shaved<00:00:43.540> off<00:00:43.720> of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
written it long enough and shaved off of

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.650 
written it long enough and shaved off of
quite<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.290> few<00:00:44.379> meals<00:00:44.710> mills<00:00:45.489> just<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.480> give<00:00:46.629> a

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
quite a few meals mills just to give a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.270 
quite a few meals mills just to give a
solid<00:00:46.899> opinion<00:00:47.079> on<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.500> wheel<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.890> tell<00:00:48.190> you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
solid opinion on the wheel and tell you

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.619 
solid opinion on the wheel and tell you
what<00:00:48.399> it's<00:00:48.520> like<00:00:48.670> when<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.090> wheel<00:00:49.210> is<00:00:49.239> in<00:00:49.480> its

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
what it's like when the wheel is in its

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.709 
what it's like when the wheel is in its
prime<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.550> one<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.149> first<00:00:52.180> things<00:00:52.449> I

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
prime so one of the first things I

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.260 
prime so one of the first things I
noticed<00:00:52.750> with<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.710> venom<00:00:53.890> tweakers<00:00:54.399> is<00:00:54.609> the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
noticed with the venom tweakers is the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.170 
noticed with the venom tweakers is the
slide<00:00:55.600> when<00:00:56.140> you're<00:00:56.289> going<00:00:56.530> fast<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.309> amazing

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
slide when you're going fast is amazing

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.259 
slide when you're going fast is amazing
it's<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:59.370> feels<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:00.640> great<00:01:00.879> when<00:01:01.059> you're<00:01:01.180> in

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
it's so it feels so great when you're in

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's so it feels so great when you're in
the<00:01:01.390> middle<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.719> slide<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.320> gives<00:01:02.739> you

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
the middle of the slide it gives you

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.249 
the middle of the slide it gives you
some<00:01:03.160> resistance<00:01:03.730> is<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:04.210> lower<00:01:04.809> durometer

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
some resistance is a lower durometer

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.900 
some resistance is a lower durometer
wheel<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.399> going<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.670> give<00:01:06.789> you<00:01:06.880> a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
wheel so it is going to give you a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.880 
wheel so it is going to give you a
little<00:01:06.970> bit<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.330> resistance<00:01:07.630> but<00:01:08.470> I<00:01:08.649> actually

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
little bit of resistance but I actually

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.620 
little bit of resistance but I actually
like<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.460> resistance<00:01:09.880> because<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.240> makes<00:01:10.420> it

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
like the resistance because it makes it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.779 
like the resistance because it makes it
feel<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:11.110> little<00:01:11.350> bit<00:01:11.530> more<00:01:11.679> controlled<00:01:12.220> which

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
feel a little bit more controlled which

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.490 
feel a little bit more controlled which
is<00:01:12.910> another<00:01:13.119> thing<00:01:13.330> is<00:01:13.479> these<00:01:13.630> wheels<00:01:13.929> are<00:01:14.110> so

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
is another thing is these wheels are so

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.410 
is another thing is these wheels are so
greatly<00:01:14.950> controllable<00:01:15.670> at<00:01:15.789> high<00:01:16.060> speed

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
greatly controllable at high speed

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.620 
greatly controllable at high speed
slides<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.740> um<00:01:18.069> which<00:01:18.729> which<00:01:19.149> is<00:01:19.179> something<00:01:19.479> I

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
slides so um which which is something I

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.999 
slides so um which which is something I
just<00:01:19.810> loved<00:01:20.020> about<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.319> will<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.560> noticed<00:01:20.890> it

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
just loved about this will I noticed it

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.449 
just loved about this will I noticed it
right<00:01:21.069> off<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.399> bat<00:01:21.550> but<00:01:21.759> at<00:01:22.750> slower<00:01:22.990> speeds

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
right off the bat but at slower speeds

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.870 
right off the bat but at slower speeds
it<00:01:24.459> is<00:01:24.729> kind<00:01:25.149> of<00:01:25.240> hard<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.569> initiate<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.229> slide

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it is kind of hard to initiate the slide

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.490 
it is kind of hard to initiate the slide
just<00:01:27.880> because<00:01:28.239> of<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.660> fact<00:01:28.899> that<00:01:29.110> it's<00:01:29.410> a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
just because of the fact that it's a

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.770 
just because of the fact that it's a
lower<00:01:29.649> durometer<00:01:30.099> and<00:01:30.429> it's<00:01:31.300> got<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> smaller

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
lower durometer and it's got a smaller

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.999 
lower durometer and it's got a smaller
contact<00:01:32.200> patch<00:01:32.349> so<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:32.649> going<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.860> be<00:01:32.979> a

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
contact patch so it's going to be a

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.680 
contact patch so it's going to be a
little<00:01:33.190> bit<00:01:33.310> harder<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.910> initiate<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.420> slides

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
little bit harder to initiate the slides

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.010 
little bit harder to initiate the slides
when<00:01:35.440> you're<00:01:35.679> going<00:01:36.099> slower<00:01:36.670> speeds<00:01:37.179> and<00:01:37.509> just

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
when you're going slower speeds and just

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.960 
when you're going slower speeds and just
cruising<00:01:38.410> around<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.250> if<00:01:39.520> that's<00:01:39.670> kind<00:01:39.940> of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
cruising around so if that's kind of

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.249 
cruising around so if that's kind of
what<00:01:40.119> you're<00:01:40.239> planning<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:40.660> get<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.899> wheel<00:01:41.050> on

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
what you're planning to get the wheel on

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.000 
what you're planning to get the wheel on
it's<00:01:41.440> just<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.860> do<00:01:42.250> spins

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
it's just to do spins

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's just to do spins
180<00:01:45.010> here<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.460> there<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.820> wouldn't<00:01:46.330> get<00:01:46.420> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
180 here and there I wouldn't get the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.850 
180 here and there I wouldn't get the
wheel<00:01:46.690> for<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.990> reason<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.470> would<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
wheel for that reason I would get the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.450 
wheel for that reason I would get the
wheel<00:01:48.040> for<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.240> purpose<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.660> doing<00:01:50.100> fast<00:01:51.100> free

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
wheel for the purpose of doing fast free

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.260 
wheel for the purpose of doing fast free
ride<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.050> mixed<00:01:53.050> in<00:01:53.170> downhill<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.910> thing<00:01:55.120> on

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
ride and mixed in downhill the thing on

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.150 
ride and mixed in downhill the thing on
this<00:01:55.390> wheel<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.630> pretty<00:01:56.080> nice<00:01:56.260> I<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.860> I

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
this wheel is pretty nice I like it I

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.770 
this wheel is pretty nice I like it I
definitely<00:01:57.460> would<00:01:57.760> prefer<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.240> ABAC<00:01:58.480> Thane

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
definitely would prefer the ABAC Thane

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.660 
definitely would prefer the ABAC Thane
over<00:01:59.050> this<00:01:59.200> thing<00:01:59.950> which<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.280> what<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> lot<00:02:00.520> of

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
over this thing which is what a lot of

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.610 
over this thing which is what a lot of
people<00:02:00.760> say<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.390> agree<00:02:01.630> with<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.810> but<00:02:02.470> it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
people say and I agree with that but it

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.410 
people say and I agree with that but it
is<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> nice<00:02:03.010> stain<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.340> think<00:02:03.640> they<00:02:03.729> did<00:02:03.880> okay<00:02:04.180> um

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
is a nice stain I think they did okay um

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.020 
is a nice stain I think they did okay um
these<00:02:05.290> wheels<00:02:05.530> are<00:02:05.680> notorious<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.610> Chungking

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
these wheels are notorious to Chungking

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.290 
these wheels are notorious to Chungking
and<00:02:07.679> only<00:02:08.679> getting<00:02:09.310> about<00:02:09.399> half<00:02:09.759> way<00:02:10.090> through

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
and only getting about half way through

and only getting about half way through
the<00:02:10.390> life<00:02:10.570> of<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:10.780> wheel<00:02:10.959> I've<00:02:11.140> already

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
the life of this wheel I've already

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.620 
the life of this wheel I've already
noticed<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.130> well<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.910> got<00:02:13.240> one<00:02:13.420> wheel

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
noticed that as well I got one wheel

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.449 
noticed that as well I got one wheel
around<00:02:13.870> here<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.410> pretty<00:02:14.890> pretty<00:02:15.520> check

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
around here that's pretty pretty check

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.940 
around here that's pretty pretty check
that's<00:02:18.459> um<00:02:19.030> that's<00:02:19.500> chipping<00:02:20.500> pretty<00:02:20.740> ding

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
that's um that's chipping pretty ding

it<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.320> bed<00:02:26.500> yet<00:02:26.680> we'll<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.459> what<00:02:27.580> happens<00:02:27.670> as

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
it to bed yet we'll see what happens as

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.699 
it to bed yet we'll see what happens as
I<00:02:28.209> go<00:02:28.360> on<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.840> wheel<00:02:29.020> but<00:02:29.560> that's

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
I go on with the wheel but that's

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.750 
I go on with the wheel but that's
another<00:02:29.920> thing<00:02:30.130> you're<00:02:30.250> gonna<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.580> look

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
another thing you're gonna have to look

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.540 
another thing you're gonna have to look
out<00:02:30.850> for<00:02:30.910> when<00:02:31.540> buying<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:32.020> wheel<00:02:32.290> as<00:02:33.250> far<00:02:33.430> as

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
out for when buying this wheel as far as

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.880 
out for when buying this wheel as far as
staining<00:02:33.970> goes<00:02:34.180> um<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.140> wheel<00:02:35.320> does<00:02:35.560> stay<00:02:35.830> in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
staining goes um the wheel does stay in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.910 
staining goes um the wheel does stay in
a<00:02:36.010> what<00:02:36.900> at<00:02:37.900> first<00:02:38.200> when<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.770> out<00:02:38.860> of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
a what at first when you get it out of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
a what at first when you get it out of
the<00:02:39.040> box<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.820> finally<00:02:40.120> break<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.630> it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the box and you finally break it in it

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.260 
the box and you finally break it in it
won't<00:02:40.959> Thane<00:02:41.260> quite<00:02:42.100> as<00:02:42.400> white<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.030> will

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
won't Thane quite as white as it will

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.270 
won't Thane quite as white as it will
when<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.020> start<00:02:44.350> wearing<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.680> down<00:02:44.890> you'll

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
when you start wearing it down you'll

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.449 
when you start wearing it down you'll
get<00:02:45.520> more<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.910> black<00:02:46.180> skidmark<00:02:46.810> type<00:02:47.140> thing

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
get more of a black skidmark type thing

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.100 
get more of a black skidmark type thing
but<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.269> start<00:02:49.510> holding<00:02:49.690> out<00:02:49.870> longer

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
but when you start holding out longer

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.780 
but when you start holding out longer
slides<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:50.830> break<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> wheel<00:02:51.549> and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
slides and you break in the wheel and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.130 
slides and you break in the wheel and
we're<00:02:52.000> down<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.390> wheel<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.959> more

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
we're down the wheel a little bit more

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.289 
we're down the wheel a little bit more
you<00:02:53.650> will<00:02:53.799> get<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> nice<00:02:54.340> white<00:02:54.730> deep<00:02:55.030> thing

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
you will get a nice white deep thing

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.060 
you will get a nice white deep thing
which<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:55.810> everybody<00:02:56.290> loves<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:56.890> that's

which is what everybody loves so that's

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.100 
which is what everybody loves so that's
great<00:02:57.310> about<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.610> wheel<00:02:57.850> they<00:02:58.450> sound<00:02:58.870> great

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
great about this wheel they sound great

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.780 
great about this wheel they sound great
you<00:02:59.560> can't<00:02:59.920> hear<00:03:00.220> them<00:03:00.280> at<00:03:00.340> all<00:03:00.459> they<00:03:00.640> don't

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
you can't hear them at all they don't

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.479 
you can't hear them at all they don't
make<00:03:00.910> noise<00:03:01.120> they<00:03:02.049> sound<00:03:02.470> super<00:03:03.010> buttery<00:03:03.190> and

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
make noise they sound super buttery and

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.400 
make noise they sound super buttery and
they<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:03.760> pretty<00:03:04.000> buttery<00:03:04.330> but<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.750> also<00:03:04.900> I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
they are pretty buttery but I also I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.110 
they are pretty buttery but I also I
also<00:03:05.980> feel<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.370> they're<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> little<00:03:06.940> bit

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
also feel like they're a little bit

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.759 
also feel like they're a little bit
sugar<00:03:07.390> as<00:03:07.570> well<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:08.140> i<00:03:08.170> guess<00:03:08.440> i'd<00:03:08.590> give<00:03:08.739> it

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
sugar as well so i guess i'd give it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.770 
sugar as well so i guess i'd give it
about<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.040> mix<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:10.150> because<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.720> fact

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
about a mix just because of the fact

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.320 
about a mix just because of the fact
that<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:12.310> gives<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> lot<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.790> resistance<00:03:13.060> in

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
that it gives you a lot of resistance in

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.699 
that it gives you a lot of resistance in
the<00:03:13.390> sign<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:13.690> doesn't<00:03:13.959> quite<00:03:14.110> feel<00:03:14.350> buttery

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
the sign it doesn't quite feel buttery

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.410 
the sign it doesn't quite feel buttery
when<00:03:14.950> you're<00:03:15.070> initiating<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.670> slide<00:03:15.910> but

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
when you're initiating the slide but

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.970 
when you're initiating the slide but
when<00:03:16.540> you're<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.840> slide<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.230> very<00:03:17.620> smooth

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
when you're in the slide is very smooth

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.370 
when you're in the slide is very smooth
so<00:03:18.010> i<00:03:18.640> guess<00:03:19.480> we'll<00:03:19.630> call<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.900> sugar<00:03:20.110> reading

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
so i guess we'll call it sugar reading

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.710 
so i guess we'll call it sugar reading
so<00:03:20.500> overall<00:03:20.920> for<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:21.970> wheel<00:03:22.150> i<00:03:22.390> would<00:03:22.540> say

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
so overall for this wheel i would say

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.930 
so overall for this wheel i would say
get<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.110> if<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.350> are<00:03:23.799> planning<00:03:24.160> on<00:03:24.370> doing<00:03:24.670> fast

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
get it if you are planning on doing fast

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.530 
get it if you are planning on doing fast
free<00:03:25.209> ride<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.720> downhill<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.120> said<00:03:28.180> it's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
free ride and downhill like I said it's

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.360 
free ride and downhill like I said it's
greatly<00:03:28.930> controllable<00:03:29.709> at<00:03:29.799> those<00:03:30.040> high-speed

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
greatly controllable at those high-speed

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.560 
greatly controllable at those high-speed
slides<00:03:31.030> feels<00:03:31.810> great<00:03:32.110> super<00:03:32.500> smooth<00:03:32.739> um<00:03:33.570> very

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
slides feels great super smooth um very

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.370 
slides feels great super smooth um very
quiet<00:03:34.959> it's<00:03:35.230> great<00:03:35.560> um<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:37.390> does<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.170> does

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380

start<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.769> chip<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.280> little<00:03:39.610> bit<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.000> it

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
start to chip a little bit and it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.510 
start to chip a little bit and it
probably<00:03:41.079> will<00:03:41.290> get<00:03:41.470> worse<00:03:41.650> as<00:03:41.890> time<00:03:42.190> go

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
probably will get worse as time go

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.100 
probably will get worse as time go
in<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.940> little<00:03:43.090> bit<00:03:43.180> more<00:03:43.360> session<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:43.930> that's

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
in a little bit more session so that's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.710 
in a little bit more session so that's
something<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.410> look<00:03:44.470> out<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.540> wheel

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
something to look out for but the wheel

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.410 
something to look out for but the wheel
is<00:03:46.900> also<00:03:47.230> flat<00:03:47.530> spot<00:03:47.850> resistant<00:03:48.850> not<00:03:49.030> flat

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
is also flat spot resistant not flat
