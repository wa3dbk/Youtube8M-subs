00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.759
 this fourth stage has 155 kilometers 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.280
 without great difficulties despite being 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.199
 a mountain stage better said with 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.750
 final mountain if it's true that it's going to 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:16.869
 there are several points to highlight the day of 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.670
 today first the port of Orduña the 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.789
 difficult slope of the country 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.160
 Basque which is one of the great ports 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.560
 of this community there surely the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.859
 race breaks and from there may arise 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.710
 some group of runners those of leaders 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.280
 good quiet to save strength for 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 the final moment 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
 the final approach is going to be another 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 very hard time for all runners 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 because not only will it be necessary to save orduña 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 those fans that are sure to arm themselves 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.719
 but especially since the end of the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.269
 head positions are going to be very 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 coveted the arrival or entry to 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.019
 port is by narrow wallet and that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.479
 encourages all runners to take 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.540
 positions so here already stuck in 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.219
 ezcaray there will be that final arreón for 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.589
 place the leaders of each team in 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.409
 good positions the beginning of the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.800
 port 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.270
 p 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.899
 Holy Water 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.060
 miraculous water this is freedom is 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.000
 that you can take one a day like today 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.490
 the cyclists are going to pass here well as 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.090
 a shot and they will see with an envy this 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.090
 source that 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 this miraculous little water I do not know if it's not going to 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.380
 allow to win today but go a little 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.380
 happier 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.350
 good what but you are encouraged to upload 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.650
 valdés caray you remember now four times 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.050
 it has gone up and your name is recorded 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.210
 gold letters to the channel once and all 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.540
 well now I tell it while we see the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.540
 rise 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.610
 go life they carry some 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.950
 I'm going to punish me now a little bit because 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.400
 valdés cara and I have it here already here 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.970
 it starts here we have the crossing and 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.970
 tie the males 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.090
 good and here is that the port itself 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.090
 they are 13 km as we see in the poster 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.000
 and we started the hardest and here the plate 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.000
 small immediately 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.820
 the most complicated this extension are me 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.420
 I think that it will also be easy to see 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.200
 the first two kilometers ramps of 8 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.819
 of 9 of 10 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.810
 but let's say they're never going to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.840
 overcome then and pass 2 km 7% 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.610
 and with it being a long port more is very 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.580
 tended to have many breaks 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.280
 a characteristic to others that we are going to 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.530
 climb this year is the road is not that 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.980
 is bad but yes, it was good 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.420
 little botox to irregular floor that 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.600
 always adds a difficulty to the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.600
 extension 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.110
 I did not have an earring commented on my 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.510
 victory here in valdezcaray but 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.460
 it is also the fifth time that it is going to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.660
 go up to this port on the return to 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.690
 Spain 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.920
 three times they found one online that 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:37.160
 it was the first time in 1988 and after 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.670
 there we are going to jump then to the current year to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.670
 2012 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.180
 The most beautiful part of this port is the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.420
 initial is a wooded zone the breaks 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.129
 harder and possibly the most 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.310
 attractive not as a mountain pass 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.950
 because then little by little the bowling 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.420
 disappears begins to enter the wind 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.849
 which is usually usual always in this 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.760
 zone and that's going to slow down a lot I think that 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.730
 the choices of the favorites of the most 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.250
 strengths of the race and maybe the best 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 we can live an outcome like that of 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.479
 88 a group of runners of about 20 25 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.300
 contesting the sprint for the victory of 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.680
 stage 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.020
 this extension to the ski resort of 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.300
 valdezcaray if you can have a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.520
 advantage or a disadvantage depending 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.650
 the forces is that you practically see 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.689
 at all times what remains the ramps 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.249
 you see the runners and they go far or near 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.189
 and above all good 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.949
 it looks like it does not really have ramps 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:44.589
 very hard is very constant and always the 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.749
 wind is the greatest difficulty to the 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:49.809
 career in recent years in the turn 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.699
 to Spain because as I said from 91 that 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:54.519
 it was the last time he got up 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.469
 find it has always been resorted to the 

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:59.349
 saw the demand that is there a 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:03.230
 little bit more to the right and that yes that is 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.400
 a much more demanding port 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.330
 but good to me 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.570
 will come here to download and bring me 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.970
 many memories since already of amateur 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.800
 I got to run and everything a nice test 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.150
 a time trial then thankfully 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.250
 the return to Spain also with triumph 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.990
 so it's a day that brings me good 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.990
 memories will come here 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.400
 a nice day today 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.910
 good change of asphalt this already indicates 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.910
 that we are arriving 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.080
 Well, all the fish is sold 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:06.569
 we have seen this season 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.069
 valdezcaray skiing maybe it's not 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.169
 very hard and may not do 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.209
 difference between the favorites but there 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.459
 have a characteristic that if the 

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:16.079
 there is possibly the culprit be that 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:18.269
 side wind that hits the area 

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.369
 haro de santodomingo the causeway in that 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.229
 approach to this port 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.059
 so problems is can be a 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.039
 arrival of a group of 20 30 runners 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:28.109
 knows sprint and that if any of the 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.029
 general is dropped is because the 

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:32.189
 fans those two colors has 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:34.649
 surprised good I leave you these are the 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:36.359
 first two stages possibly I say 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.819
 Two mountain stages with high end 

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:40.709
 less hard than the ones that come now 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.349
 hen the ancares lakes and all those 

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:45.539
 that's really big words so 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.659
 We will see the next few days until 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.659
 then
