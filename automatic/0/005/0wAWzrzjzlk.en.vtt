00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.080
 the sound effects 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.080

 29 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.240
 was reading after twenty minutes 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.230
 as said 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.569

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.569
 You can now even have a real one 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.910
 2 in the centers are pieces to think twice before going a bit too far 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.910
 lee 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.179
 a new crisis time initiative is really terrible 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.829
 as people feel 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.799
 three weeks in the media 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:25.920
 hahaha 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.049
 do something like that 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.579
 see people coming when it comes to justice 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.939
 for this he has to critically draw lessons 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.999
 that does research 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.060

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.399

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 state 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:16.829
 she says that 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.829
 these connections 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.959
 it is 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.079

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.429
 8 a7 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.229
 of course not working 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.759
 but they know 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.109
 although the country 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.109
 college 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.889

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.839
 reading the newspaper 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.520

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.729
 you are not logged in 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.139
 day 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.139
 He broke through Motorola Droid this year 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.990
 their mission 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.990
 in addition to the many times larger 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.830
 therefor 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.960
 what are you a connoisseur 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.960
 in Brabant but because of that says leo 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.110
 again it's in a cupboard with blue carpet underpants 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.219
 back home after questioning 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.649
