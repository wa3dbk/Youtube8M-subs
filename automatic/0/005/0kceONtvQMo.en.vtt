in<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.600> it<00:05:24.600> would<00:05:25.020> take<00:05:25.140> a<00:05:25.169> little<00:05:25.290> longer<00:05:25.530> to

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
in that it would take a little longer to

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.250

would have to go back in it would have

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.240 
would have to go back in it would have
to<00:05:29.850> get<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.240> new<00:05:30.840> IP<00:05:31.020> address<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:32.010> it<00:05:32.130> would

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
have to set itself back up again it'll

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.810 
have to set itself back up again it'll
probably<00:05:34.380> take<00:05:34.590> about<00:05:34.680> another<00:05:34.950> 15<00:05:35.490> minutes

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820
