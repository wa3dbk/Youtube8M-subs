I mean I didn't help you burn lawns

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.039 
I mean I didn't help you burn lawns
every<00:00:14.880> time<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> put<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.540> makeup<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
every time you had to put on makeup I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.290 
every time you had to put on makeup I
was<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.230> tomboy<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.070> every<00:00:17.850> time<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.119> used<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
was a tomboy and every time I used to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
was a tomboy and every time I used to
ask<00:00:18.420> my<00:00:18.660> mom<00:00:18.869> she'd<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.230> you're<00:00:19.740> too

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
ask my mom she'd be like you're too

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.230 
ask my mom she'd be like you're too
young<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.100> makeup<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:25.789> lately<00:00:26.789> I've<00:00:26.910> seen<00:00:27.119> her

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
young for makeup or lately I've seen her

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.490 
young for makeup or lately I've seen her
makeup<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> still<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.289> kind<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
makeup and I still think it's kind of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.759 
makeup and I still think it's kind of
heavy<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.130> daytime<00:00:30.060> right<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.590> also

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
heavy for daytime right and it's also

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.850 
heavy for daytime right and it's also
clumpy<00:00:32.329> yeah<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.739> she

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
clumpy yeah and I don't know that she

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.260 
clumpy yeah and I don't know that she
her<00:00:35.010> application<00:00:35.160> she<00:00:35.730> still<00:00:35.969> doesn't<00:00:36.239> know

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
her application she still doesn't know

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
her application she still doesn't know
the<00:00:36.600> proper<00:00:36.960> application<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.550> looked

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the proper application and it looked

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.549 
the proper application and it looked
like<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.960> photo

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
like from a photo

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.880 
like from a photo
she<00:00:41.160> had<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.399> purple<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:42.450> something<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
she had like purple or something on and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
she had like purple or something on and
she<00:00:44.010> said<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> wasn't<00:00:44.430> purple<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
she said it wasn't purple it was just

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110 
she said it wasn't purple it was just
like<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> shimmer<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> translated<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
like a shimmer but it translated in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.770 
like a shimmer but it translated in
photos<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.600> purple<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:56.300> notice<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

pearl<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.320> gone<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.630> first<00:01:06.960> step<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
pearl is gone and the first step is to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:29.440 
pearl is gone and the first step is to
apply

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450
