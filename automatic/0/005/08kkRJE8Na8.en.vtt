00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.280 

so<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.390> step<00:01:45.630> while<00:01:45.960> phase

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so that was that was step while phase

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.190 
so that was that was step while phase
one<00:01:47.450> super<00:01:48.450> adventure

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
