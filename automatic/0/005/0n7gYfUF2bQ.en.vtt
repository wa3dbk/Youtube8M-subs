not<00:04:43.630> eating<00:04:44.020> enough<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:44.770> they<00:04:44.979> are<00:04:45.100> more

around<00:04:48.310> them<00:04:48.639> other<00:04:49.600> things<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.020> might

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
around them other things you might

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.770 
around them other things you might
notice<00:04:50.320> are<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> lot<00:04:50.919> of<00:04:51.070> talk<00:04:51.400> about<00:04:51.729> food<00:04:52.360> and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
notice are a lot of talk about food and

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.670 
notice are a lot of talk about food and
exercise<00:04:53.669> a<00:04:54.669> lot<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.479> talking<00:04:56.350> about<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.590> and

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
exercise a lot of talking about it and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800 
exercise a lot of talking about it and
perhaps<00:04:56.800> even<00:04:57.430> complaining<00:04:57.940> about<00:04:58.150> being<00:04:58.510> fat

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
perhaps even complaining about being fat

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.409 
perhaps even complaining about being fat
when<00:04:59.080> it's<00:04:59.199> really<00:04:59.470> clear<00:04:59.800> that<00:04:59.830> they<00:05:00.160> are<00:05:00.190> not

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
when it's really clear that they are not

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.510 
when it's really clear that they are not
so<00:05:01.419> mostly<00:05:01.900> I've<00:05:02.080> been<00:05:02.320> talking<00:05:02.800> about<00:05:03.070> things

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
so mostly I've been talking about things

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.150 
so mostly I've been talking about things
that<00:05:03.610> are<00:05:03.729> more<00:05:03.910> related<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:05.160> individuals

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
that are more related to individuals

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.070 
that are more related to individuals
restricting<00:05:06.760> their<00:05:07.030> food<00:05:07.240> intake<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:07.720> that's

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
restricting their food intake and that's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.320 
restricting their food intake and that's
one<00:05:08.380> form<00:05:08.710> of<00:05:08.830> eating<00:05:09.190> disorder<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:10.180> we

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
one form of eating disorder that we

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.700 
one form of eating disorder that we
would<00:05:10.479> look<00:05:10.630> at<00:05:10.780> along<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.410> lines<00:05:11.560> of

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
would look at along the lines of

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.790 
would look at along the lines of
anorexia<00:05:12.130> nervosa<00:05:12.250> on<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.870> other<00:05:14.199> side<00:05:14.590> of

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
anorexia nervosa on the other side of

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.900 
anorexia nervosa on the other side of
things<00:05:14.979> is<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.460> sometimes<00:05:16.000> people<00:05:16.630> are

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
things is that sometimes people are

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.700 
things is that sometimes people are

the pantry or it seems to be missing

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.230 
the pantry or it seems to be missing
would<00:05:46.930> be<00:05:46.960> one<00:05:47.500> way<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.280> pay<00:05:48.610> attention<00:05:48.849> to

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
would be one way to pay attention to

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.550 
would be one way to pay attention to
that<00:05:49.979> also<00:05:50.979> in<00:05:51.160> terms<00:05:51.520> of<00:05:51.990> children<00:05:52.990> deciding

that also in terms of children deciding

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.950 
that also in terms of children deciding

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
to try to get rid of that food one of

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.360 
to try to get rid of that food one of
the<00:05:56.020> most<00:05:56.229> common<00:05:56.560> ways<00:05:56.680> they<00:05:56.889> do<00:05:56.949> that<00:05:57.160> is

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
the most common ways they do that is

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.150 
the most common ways they do that is
through<00:05:57.550> vomiting<00:05:58.090> and<00:05:58.900> so<00:05:59.410> you<00:05:59.680> may<00:05:59.860> need<00:06:00.010> to

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
through vomiting and so you may need to

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.980 
through vomiting and so you may need to
pay<00:06:00.310> attention<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.849> whether<00:06:01.030> you're<00:06:01.630> seeing

remnants or smelling that in places

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.080 
remnants or smelling that in places
people<00:06:08.020> that<00:06:08.199> are<00:06:08.349> really<00:06:09.280> trying<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.729> hide
