now what this is as a move around to the
right<00:04:38.330> here<00:04:41.590> it's<00:04:42.590> basically<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.370> very<00:04:43.699> large

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449

launch smoke bombs and that way you have

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.290 
launch smoke bombs and that way you have

a smoke screen if you found you have the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.149 
a smoke screen if you found you have the
egress<00:05:14.300> or<00:05:14.539> otherwise<00:05:14.900> stop<00:05:15.620> people<00:05:15.919> shooting

at<00:05:16.310> you

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
at you

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.110 
at you
loading<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.400> gun<00:05:19.550> from<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.759> loaders

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
loading the gun from the loaders

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.480 
loading the gun from the loaders
perspective<00:05:20.810> is<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.139> little<00:05:21.530> bit<00:05:21.650> awkward<00:05:22.070> I

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
perspective is a little bit awkward I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.650 
perspective is a little bit awkward I
think<00:05:22.789> it's<00:05:22.880> probably<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.180> easiest<00:05:23.270> way<00:05:23.630> of

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
think it's probably the easiest way of

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.409 
think it's probably the easiest way of
putting<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.250> my<00:05:25.250> mobility<00:05:25.550> is<00:05:25.880> limited<00:05:25.910> by<00:05:26.360> the

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
putting it my mobility is limited by the

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.350 
putting it my mobility is limited by the
fact<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.990> ammunition<00:05:27.289> bins<00:05:27.830> which<00:05:28.789> at

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
fact that the ammunition bins which at

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.249 
fact that the ammunition bins which at
least<00:05:29.750> are<00:05:30.110> somewhat<00:05:30.530> armoured<00:05:31.720> will<00:05:32.720> stop<00:05:33.080> me

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
least are somewhat armoured will stop me

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.529 
least are somewhat armoured will stop me
from<00:05:33.410> moving<00:05:33.620> my<00:05:33.860> legs<00:05:34.039> around<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:35.030> lift

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
up the round comes all the way up you

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.900 
up the round comes all the way up you
then<00:05:37.940> have<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.330> turn<00:05:38.509> it<00:05:38.690> round<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:40.250> find<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.759> way
