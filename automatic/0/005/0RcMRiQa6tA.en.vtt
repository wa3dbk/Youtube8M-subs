00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.130 

we're<00:00:22.060> taking<00:00:22.210> these<00:00:22.420> pictures<00:00:22.690> of<00:00:22.870> different

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
we're taking these pictures of different

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.450 
we're taking these pictures of different
angles<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:24.850> can<00:00:25.000> calibrate<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.950> position<00:00:27.340> of

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
angles we can calibrate the position of

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.820 
angles we can calibrate the position of
the<00:00:27.610> fifties<00:00:28.120> target<00:00:28.600> market<00:00:29.020> and<00:00:29.560> nearly

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
the fifties target market and nearly

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.080 
the fifties target market and nearly
roads<00:00:30.640> into<00:00:30.940> each<00:00:31.060> other<00:00:32.670> once<00:00:33.670> we<00:00:33.760> know<00:00:33.880> that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
roads into each other once we know that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.000 
roads into each other once we know that
we<00:00:34.360> can<00:00:34.480> then<00:00:34.630> track<00:00:34.870> this<00:00:34.990> thing<00:00:35.050> little<00:00:35.830> left

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
we can then track this thing little left

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.150 
we can then track this thing little left
don't<00:00:36.910> camera<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:38.290> guy<00:00:38.470> right<00:00:38.650> here<00:00:38.710> that

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
don't camera this guy right here that

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.510 
don't camera this guy right here that
little<00:00:39.370> little<00:00:40.059> guy<00:00:40.210> there<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:42.190> cameras

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
little little guy there what cameras

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.520 
little little guy there what cameras
that's<00:00:43.480> just<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:44.010> geeky<00:00:45.010> camera<00:00:46.230> things<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.350> as

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
that's just a geeky camera things up as

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.010 
that's just a geeky camera things up as
de<00:00:47.770> it's<00:00:48.700> like<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.850> megapixel<00:00:49.300> resolution

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
de it's like a megapixel resolution

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.360 
de it's like a megapixel resolution
actually<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.830> think<00:00:50.860> that's<00:00:51.100> 2<00:00:51.250> megapixels<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
actually I think that's 2 megapixels but

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.030 
actually I think that's 2 megapixels but
we<00:00:54.430> can<00:00:54.550> use<00:00:54.670> pretty<00:00:54.850> much<00:00:54.910> any<00:00:55.000> camera

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.000 

so<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.670> just<00:00:58.850> load<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.120> images<00:00:59.420> in<00:00:59.600> yep<00:01:00.200> and

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
so you just load the images in yep and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.570 
so you just load the images in yep and
you<00:01:01.250> lay<00:01:01.430> off<00:01:01.460> we<00:01:02.360> took<00:01:02.650> ok<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:03.980> we're<00:01:04.460> going

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
you lay off we took ok and we're going

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.660 
you lay off we took ok and we're going
to<00:01:04.610> take<00:01:04.850> I'm<00:01:05.210> going<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.420> pick

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.219 

a<00:01:07.729> couple<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.299> two<00:01:08.570> images<00:01:08.720> where<00:01:09.049> there's

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
a couple of two images where there's

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.270 
a couple of two images where there's
reasonable<00:01:09.619> over<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.090> I'm<00:01:11.090> going<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.450> detect

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
reasonable over that I'm going to detect

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
reasonable over that I'm going to detect
the<00:01:13.570> targets<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.810> this<00:01:15.290> one<00:01:15.500> camera

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.590 

he<00:01:20.640> should

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
he should

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.170 
he should
yes<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.770> rough<00:01:24.280> estimation<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.880> these<00:01:25.030> two

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
yes the rough estimation of these two

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.670 
yes the rough estimation of these two
cameras<00:01:25.570> which<00:01:25.780> were<00:01:25.930> actually<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> position

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
cameras which were actually the position

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.789 
cameras which were actually the position
that<00:01:26.799> was<00:01:26.950> still<00:01:27.189> still<00:01:28.060> cameras<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.799> missed

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
that was still still cameras we missed

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.219 
that was still still cameras we missed
ocular<00:01:30.100> disease<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.299> three<00:01:31.630> targets<00:01:32.110> in

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
ocular disease and the three targets in

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
ocular disease and the three targets in
3d<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:33.700> we<00:01:33.759> go<00:01:34.119> through<00:01:35.280> other<00:01:36.280> images<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.930 

detect<00:01:40.509> targets<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.259> then<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:41.950> resection<00:01:42.850> a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
detect targets and then we resection a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.389 
detect targets and then we resection a
camera<00:01:43.330> let's<00:01:43.659> enter<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.049> camera<00:01:44.409> move<00:01:45.280> this

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
camera let's enter the camera move this

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.760 
camera let's enter the camera move this
to<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.700> camera<00:01:46.119> then<00:01:46.899> we<00:01:47.020> optimize<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:49.770> keep

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
to the camera then we optimize and keep

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.410 
to the camera then we optimize and keep
doing<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.070> process<00:01:51.399> until<00:01:52.030> we'll<00:01:52.210> start

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
doing that process until we'll start

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.920 
doing that process until we'll start
adding<00:01:52.600> these<00:01:52.840> fiducials

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.190 

impact

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:17.030 

advanced<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.070> camera

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.039 

things<00:02:17.700> he<00:02:17.939> was<00:02:18.090> building<00:02:18.329> up<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.900> scene

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
things he was building up the scene

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.630 
things he was building up the scene
that's<00:02:22.049> all<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> images

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.390 

we<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.210> our<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:26.140> upside<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.470> from<00:02:26.800> OT<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
we have our it's upside down from OT it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.030 
we have our it's upside down from OT it
doesn't<00:02:27.700> know<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:27.880> way<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.300> world<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.660> up

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
doesn't know which way the world is up

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.280 
doesn't know which way the world is up
so<00:02:30.040> we're<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.340> do<00:02:30.490> is<00:02:31.110> we're<00:02:32.110> going<00:02:32.230> to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
so we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.640 
so we're going to do is we're going to
set<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.800> world<00:02:33.280> origin<00:02:33.790> now

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.979 

so<00:02:41.129> that's<00:02:41.340> now<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.549> put<00:02:41.879> our<00:02:42.060> world<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.750> light

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
so that's now to put our world to light

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.229 
so that's now to put our world to light
me<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.430> now<00:02:44.430> we're<00:02:44.549> going<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.760> set<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.030> world

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
me up now we're going to set the world

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.979 
me up now we're going to set the world
origin<00:02:46.700> I'm<00:02:47.700> actually<00:02:47.879> just<00:02:48.120> using<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
origin I'm actually just using a a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.500 
origin I'm actually just using a a
natural<00:02:49.500> particular<00:02:50.010> target<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.269> line

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
natural particular target to the line

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.140 
natural particular target to the line
world<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.410 

that<00:02:57.659> is<00:02:57.780> all<00:02:57.930> well<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.030> an<00:03:00.120> exact

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
that is all well so this is an exact

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.320 
that is all well so this is an exact
replica<00:03:00.629> of<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> students<00:03:01.260> yeah

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
replica of the students yeah

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.160 
replica of the students yeah
we're<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.110> export<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.770> seen

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.870 

all<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.770> targets<00:03:09.950> relative<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.640> each<00:03:10.700> other

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
all the targets relative to each other

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.270 
all the targets relative to each other
so<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:11.360> don't<00:03:11.720> powerbuilder<00:03:12.230> fair<00:03:12.530> result<00:03:12.650> we

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
so you don't powerbuilder fair result we

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.610 
so you don't powerbuilder fair result we
could<00:03:13.520> yep<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.540> once<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:14.840> know<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.170> we<00:03:15.470> can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
could yep and once we know that we can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.440 
could yep and once we know that we can
determine<00:03:15.890> where<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.400> tracking<00:03:16.849> cameras<00:03:17.270> I'm

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
determine where the tracking cameras I'm

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.809 
determine where the tracking cameras I'm
gonna<00:03:17.599> fire<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.989> tracking<00:03:18.319> software

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.289
