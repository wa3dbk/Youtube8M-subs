00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello friends I know that many of you are 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 distrustful and in some video you say 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.450
 Well, this man starts doing things 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.330
 and you do not do them then fix 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.650
 the work of almost three quarters of an hour 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.650
 to prune the plum 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.680
 also to see the branch that remains after 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.080
 d 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.070
 of pruning the amount of branch as you see 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.279
 the tree has been almost all three 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.190
 fourth parts of branches have been removed 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.440
 let's leave the center luminosity 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.110
 remove branches from the center and there you see the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.710
 tree that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.570
 will win we will win that now the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.390
 Winter pruning goes a little bit more 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.880
 even flowers and that flower there 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.250
 with the cold but we will win facing 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.750
 the winter tail as we have many 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.520
 fewer branches and the tree is more healthy 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.739
 there are people who give I can never 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.980
 parrots the fruit trees urban you will see the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.570
 uneven a plum of 78 meters where 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.240
 you will not be able to get the fruit 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.070
 and these trees that usually have 23 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.840
 meters if we are paying for it is 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.250
 much easier to catch the fruit yet 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.140
 you can see here some plums that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.540
 I have to pick up now because if not to 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.670
 the birds now that they are going to see it and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 the sparrows were around here I have 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.290
 the basket in a corner and I would take the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.450
 at the end of the fruit because 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 there is very little fruit and / or enough fruit 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.960
 this year I added calcium carbonate 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.270
 calcium and gave many more fruits because 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.820
 the earth in my garden is something acidic 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.979
 then you have to raise the ph and it's very 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.790
 good to add in low ph up the th 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.710
 alkalize a little more the earth 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.479
 so that the thin fruits also and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.360
 that's how you have seen in others 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.100
 videos with good calcium carbonate 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.550
 we are going to walk little by little 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.160
 because my daughter says dad you have to see 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.780
 the branch that we got and we're going to go towards 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.780
 the branch now we are walking 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.630
 and let's see the branches of the followed 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.970
 of the skirts forgive 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.310
 Let's see what 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.990
 and that had then and now the same but 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.980
 says the voice said let's see the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.150
 branch that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.740
 but after the pruning that was already 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.350
 to recycle fix now I have to 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.990
 paint in addition to the amount of branches 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.790
 that there was and already this video then devote 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.439
 especially 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.060

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.670
