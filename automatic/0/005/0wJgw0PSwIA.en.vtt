00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:20.119
trouble with my name, everyone's gonna say
"you should change it American"

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:34.560
misfortune or fame, casually loathe the deal
that they sell me with hollow eyes

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.460
and I know they await just to colonize...

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.260
trouble with my game, TURNAROUND jumper SMACKs the rim

00:00:50.260 --> 00:01:01.560
and splashes into the stratosphere
tell me how just so did I end up here?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:16.060
trouble with my name, trouble with my name
trouble with my name, trouble with my name

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:35.060
spending my time with idiot sons of ceos 
lost their heads up their father's ass

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:49.460
capital crime, taken for granted now
as the way that it has to pass

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.560
we all know it's the scheme of the ruling class.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:24.060
piss down the drain, all of my incensed blues
that it took all my life to sing

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.560
trouble with my name, maybe I'd have some luck ...

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.560
if I should change it to "Zimmerman"

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:50.060
I can't know what that legacy meant to him
for we hail from the far-out Carpathians

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.560
and we are both alive Zoroastrians (or something).

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:17.560
trouble with my name, trouble with my name
trouble with my name, trouble with my name
