00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.890
 us system on processors 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.190
 intended to exchange information 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.730
 microprocessors with any internal 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.030
 device eco processor on systems 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.650
 controller or computer as 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.320
 mandatory devices which 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.140
 part of the love processor 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.300
 systems can be called operational 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.929
 storage device constantly 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.179
 law and yet this device is a timer and 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.079
 input output ports 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.539
 The bus system is dependent on these 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.219
 processes at least one or more 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.619
 pedestrians usa 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.960
 one or more data bus silence 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.710
 control if data and address cache 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.809
 used to increase 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.559
 CPU performance using 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 only in sexual processors 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.090
 universal processors and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.630
 controllers are usually applied from our 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.990
 addresses a number of our citizens 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.140
 they are silence 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 put different meanings 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.640
 provide different issues 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.450
 case leakage under the concept of tires disappear 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.010
 implies parallel 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.790
 position right 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.440
 on which the binary is transmitted 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.590
 information 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.690
 while on every occasion transmitted 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 separate cashless discharge 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.990
 information can be transmitted in one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.979
 direction as for example for tires 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.910
 addresses and devoid of control 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.020
 or in different directions the top 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.070
 data 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 data community information 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 transmitted either by processors either from 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.270
 process depending on the write operation and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.890
 which is currently reading 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.980
 carries out processes 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.020
 sometimes to increase processing speed 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.080
 information 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.160
 management functions with Tymoshenko takes on 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.480
 yourself separate chips for example 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.760
 direct memory access controller or 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.920
 coprocessor 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.240
 arbitration court subsystems machine when 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.509
 This carries all the cars. 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.210
 practically a signal is enough 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090
 bus employment 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 in some cases understand arshin 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.810
 additionally includes requirements 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.910
 by voltage levels which 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.140
 represented by zeros or ones 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.690
 transmitted by her failure there 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.330
 requirements may be included 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.930
 Persons from the fronts transmitted 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.600
 signals 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.500
 type of used deployed decay 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.110
 effects of signal and speed 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.330
 transfer between them
