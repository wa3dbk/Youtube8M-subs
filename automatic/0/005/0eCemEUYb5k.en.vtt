00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.570
 this tutorial to be able to pass this the 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.790
 client of the league of legends in the 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.250
 Spanish to English and without us pulling 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.419
 these common mistakes that this one by 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.140
 example is an error that appears 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.939
 when you enter the game on the page 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.860
 start of the client you think this error 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.610
 It is quite annoying 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.220
 says he can not load the page like this 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.290
 than to do it correctly and without 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.860
 mistakes you have to follow these steps 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.420
 first we are going to team we are going to look for 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.030
 the route was not installed to our 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.660
 league of legends client my case goes 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.660
 to be a local raid disc game league of 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.000
 legends radas 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.610
 here we enter system 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.420
 we open this file that calls the ok 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.790
 well we open it with the notebook in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.860
 my case with this automatically for longer 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.080
 I put him to open me with the pad of 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.900
 notes before but good are going to have 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.900
 dawn a good backup this said well 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.060
 to this we delete it let's put the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.300
 script under use as this one ends 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.980
 respecting uppercase and lowercase 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.410
 we save this file 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.310
 we close them now let's do open 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.310
 the book lessons 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.120
 in this case he tells me that he is 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 and is already authorized 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.370
 it may be that in your case 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.520
 start to download files is normal 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.350
 because you to the alternate of clint in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.150
 Spanish and they want to pass it to English 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.640
 obviously they will not have those files 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.720
 audio in English and they do it they 're going to 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.550
 start downloading this at this moment 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.470
 that in my case like I decide tests already 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.290
 I have downloaded it and that's why I did not 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.900
 download we put good here open it for 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.900
 that update it well we put play 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.020
 let's get the account 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 well this is the common mistake this 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.110
 Sometimes it happens to fix this error 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.100
 we close the client 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.100
 let's go again 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.990
 it was not installed in the riot rivers 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.760
 games league of legends let's grab 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.760
 again and here we go to project after 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.550
 we are going to the first time the Lord to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 client client we go to this reliefs 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.690
 we open this folder from here we open this 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.080
 another that says deploy 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 and here we look for this we double click 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.870
 to open the file 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.269
 good what do you want to do 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 we put to each select a list of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.540
 the installed programs we select 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.990
 Notepad 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.250
 and we can accept 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.490
 well here he says in Basque, so 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.950
 is for it to work in English here there 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.320
 have to do the opposite step to what 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.800
 we did previously 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.230
 here it does not say it's Russian language let's put 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.069
 is 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.069
 and down 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.049
 mx 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.840
 let's save 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.660
 let's close this window and now a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.080
 very important step for the client 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.430
 do not modify this file 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.810
 let's go this we right click on the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.810
 file that we just edited 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.390
 let's go to properties 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.570
 and we put only reading here we throw this 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.570
 there only reading to apply accept 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.769
 and with that we would be going to check it 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:17.420
 something we put with tiger - play 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.420
 do not worry that nothing happens 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.509
 we start session 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.349
 and there we have everything working here 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.689
 obviously they will see this as 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.100
 it was in Spanish but when it comes 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.770
 in the game they have the game 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.920
 they will see what is on is the 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.500
 audio in english let's go back 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.160
 let's create a custom for 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.160
 check this 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.450
 is one of caruna good here they are going to 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.450
 have spanish is normal 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.020
 let's wait for the game to start 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.440
 and they're going to see that inside it's going to be in 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:20.010
 English and the skills I think they will be 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.010
 in Spanish 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.200
 let's wait for it to start 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.310
 good that we are 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.310
 here we see that the audio 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.160
 is in English 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.160
 and of threat skills in English 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.480
 and I have ready 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.340
 to enjoy in English so this 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.430
 it was all for today I hope you have them 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.300
