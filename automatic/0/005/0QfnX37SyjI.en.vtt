00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.500
 hello everyone in this video vi 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.800
 I will illustrate how to decorate this 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.590
 wooden crutch 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.030
 in the information box beside it will be 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.100
 present the list cannot give everything 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.860
 what is needed, however, there is a lot of work 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.660
 by hand during the doubt video 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.420
 problem that you have contacted me 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.680
 I answered this as soon as I could 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.900
 leave the tutorial and I hope you 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.560
 like it and the next hello 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.870
 ok I will put our our base 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.930
 primer on a face now we will go to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.360
 put it on the other face as being 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.989
 so I use this primer this 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.850
 grasping then I burn a little myself 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:01:00.190
 rest on my plate and with a brush a 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.899
 flat lava tip to spread out applied 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.150
 the premier on all the other faÃ§ade e 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.250
 then let dry we apply 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.170
 an abrasive sponge pleases a lot 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:18.430
 thin then very gently 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:20.440
 we are going to pass it along on pillars well 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.450
 having done this we can begin with the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.490
 color drawing in this case i 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.390
 as background I use a green a very green 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.880
 clear indeed use a green field and how 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.870
 always today I love you and the over are in 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.390
 our paper roof and with our own 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.660
 flat tip brush we have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.290
 before we clean it then we go to pass 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.290
 over the entire surface 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.270
 ok while the light green dries in 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.850
 these areas here and therefore all along it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.130
 object thickness with big color 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.860
 darker green indeed took its own 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.580
 dark green, therefore, as always 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:06.100
 we shake where we are in our kitten 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:10.860
 of paper and this organ we apply it 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.569
 with the very small pointed brush 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.840
 let's go back to applying all along 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.840
 the thickness 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.049
 ok so the object is now seen in 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.180
 this way I must then explained the 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.549
 light green over all on all the two 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.470
 faces and dark green therefore long 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.010
 all the thickness both outside and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.129
 inside now what i want to do with 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.110
 the sponge and a bright color of 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.159
 these players notice indeed use 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.129
 we always help a bright green 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.879
 over we are always our renewed 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.950
 of paper and what we do in pretend the 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.239
 apulia in our color and let's go 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.470
 so where to stop it a lot 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.890
 gently over the entire surface 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.290
 of the object both this and this one 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.870
 to give a very special effect e 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.870
 therefore unique the only other color 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.810
 ok so this is the effect that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.970
 we should have gotten after 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.620
 applied our chestnut 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.019
 now it remains to decide what paper 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.790
 I use in this case choose 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.849
 this rice house that for these reasons 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.879
 floral you can listen to a tartare of 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.970
 peace a napkin and indifferent here 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.640
 now I'm going to cut out scissors 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.879
 figures that I go that will then go then to 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.379
 then apply on the object ok 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.650
 we cut from our card 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.910
 rice our flowers the ride arranged up 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.700
 one of our objects is obviously not 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.420
 glued but simply supported 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.459
 so to give us an idea of the indicative 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.430
 put them this because because with one 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.290
 pencil it is necessary to delimit the areas where 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.690
 he wanted to put our flowers on our own 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.620
 rice paper for those who were left 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.769
 split does not want as a background basis 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.260
 very dark in color because 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.199
 the with a dark color would neutralize 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.539
 the color of the decoration on the paper 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.139
 while a light color like ivory 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.780
 then milk or white as it would skip 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.630
 it is appropriate before applying girls 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.080
 weighs on our object is appropriate 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.630
 create a white base but I don't know everything 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.630
 21 on everything but only on the parts 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.460
 in the parts that we want 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.650
 make use of our flowers 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.880
 so right now we imitate 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.800
 these areas in a very coarse 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.510
 and also this anchor on all the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.940
 areas where our di will then go 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.410
 flowers we have thus made a leap of 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.889
 alien cow 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.030
 but now we need to attack our i 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.190
 our our paper and to do it we will use 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.470
 a glue in this case a glue sail 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.050
 which has no particular glue indicated 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.910
 just for rice paper and napkins 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.039
 all for all those materials that they are 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.990
 very fragile and very delicate 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:22.070
 we play and the aifa we are a little ours 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:25.169
 saucer ok and keep ours 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.240
 brush obligation that we washed and 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.719
 they must bend the glue in these areas 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.719
 white 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.830
 ok then mixed our glue 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.210
 we begin to apply the decorations 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.210
 our our flowers 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.520
 don't worry if white comes out 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.300
 out white outside because where they win e 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.210
 we will also color the return 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:55.350
 of our paper ok then put the coi 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.060
 flowers on the king apply it on the glue 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.590
 with the Renault on our flowers 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.720
 then the important game with him 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.280
 same day brush this 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.640
 procedure is appropriate to start from 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.350
 center outward to avoid and to 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.320
 do it to get the air out of you 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.570
 could be established inside the 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.400
 paper under the paper then doing so 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.760
 we avoid the formation of ugly 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.910
 bubbles I forgot to tell you something 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.440
 when we did these areas and talk 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.700
 of a white colored one 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.610
 I used this milky white now it's what 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.840
 let's go to relieve and report 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.780
 our our flowers 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.760
 so let's create a kind of 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.380
 play of colors and one such that they result 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.600
 take the relief then what 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.600
 let's first of all use our own 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.820
 dark green therefore as always we adhere 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.850
 our color the over we are in ours 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.460
 destiny of paper and with a brush a 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.180
 tip very small and with plenty 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.650
 caution 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:58.110
 let's say let's go over the edges 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.090
 of our of our figures where 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.610
 there is green of course 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.610
