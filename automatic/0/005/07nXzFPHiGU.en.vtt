00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.400
- All right, so we're gonna
play--here's your paddle.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.466
I'm sure you have one, but--

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.766
- Can we spank each other
with it?

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.933
- Yes, you can.
You can do whatever you want.

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.000
[laughter]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm gonna have a question,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.933
and we're gonna answer honestly.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.266
I've never seen these, so...

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.166
Okay, "Never have I ever
had phone sex."

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.433
[laughter]

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.000
[cheers and applause]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.433
- You liar.
- I'm not lying.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.700
- Really?
- Wow.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.700
- Wow.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.833
"Never have I ever used

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.733
someone else's toothbrush
without telling them."

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.066
Ew.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.933
[laughter]

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.600
"Never have I ever
fooled around

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.466
in a bathroom during a party."

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.366
[laughter]

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.366
[cheers and applause]

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.800
- These are--
- This is the 21st century.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.333
- These are tame.
- Yeah.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.700
- "Never have I ever
gotten kicked out of a bar."

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.000
[laughter]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.600
- I just turned 21.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.800
- Be honest.
- I just turned 21.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
- Turn that thing around,
Justin.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.800
- I just turned 21 though.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.500
[laughter]

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.166
- J.
- I swear.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.766
- All right.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:08.100
"Never have I ever dated someone
and their sibling."

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:12.100
[laughter]

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
[cheers and applause]

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.700
Ah. Oh, God.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.266
"Never have I ever
fooled around

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.333
with someone else in the room."

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.566
"When someone else in the--

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.766
with someone else in the room."

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.233
- Just wave your hands
in the air.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.800
[cheers and applause]

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.033
I mean, all these questions
are sexual.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.033
Just saying.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:36.200
- Um...
[laughter]

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.066
"Never have I ever
forgotten the name

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.366
of the person
I was fooling around with."

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.800
[laughter]

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.800
[laughter and applause]

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.600
Come on!

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.233
You two are perfect
for each other.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.300
[laughter]

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.566
That's all that we have.

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.333
- Oh, let's do more.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.333
- It's a fun game, right?

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.433
- It is.
- I know.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.900
- I feel like I'm getting
to know my new boyfriend.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.200
[laughter]

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.600
[audience whooping]

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.766
[cheers and applause]

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.000
- Wait, come up with a question,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.300
and we'll answer it right now
in the spot.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.066
- Um...

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:15.866
Never have I ever had...

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.033
[clears throat]

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.500
[laughter]

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.766
sex with two different people--

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:24.266
with more than two different
people in one day.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:26.233
audience: Oh.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:31.700
[cheers and applause]

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.200
- [laughs]

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.366
- I mean, two different people
in a day, Madonna?

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.600
- Here's the thing.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.333
I want it to be special
for my wife.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.866
[audience member whoops]
- Aw.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.166
- Aw. I don't buy that.
- I don't--

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.333
- All right.
[laughter]
