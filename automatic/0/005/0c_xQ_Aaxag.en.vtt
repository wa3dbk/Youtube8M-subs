 Nero came to power in a difficult time 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.100
 the state still could not come in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.000
 the empire survived and entered the era

 reign of nero rice she is frome

 covers the period of the last years of life 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.060
 the last emperor of the dynasty 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.850
 the game tells the story of centurion 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.760
 Maria the hero of the Roman army plot is served 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.280
 in the form of flashbacks on the idea of Mary 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.229
 talking to bumpy both locked in 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090

 barbarian attacks on rome centurion 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.979
 will talk about the British company and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.270
 some events after it and 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.670
 to participate in all of this to be 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.680
 the player should immediately say that despite 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.030
 on positioning rice as 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.210
 historical drama 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.470
 it is regrettably little historicity 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.750
 it seems that the edge was flowing 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.450
 read a very bad school textbook 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.690
 in Roman history, but what is not in it 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.160
 it was decided to think independently 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.750
 of course, and much could be written off 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.840
 on the conventions of the game 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.420
 but not in this case mechanics 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.550
 building historical drama in 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.770
 relative free sti creation 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.380
 the main plot of ice but at the same time 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 in the most accurate creation of the surrounding 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.020
 of the world 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.720
 that is, it could be any number 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.730
 play with the narrative line of the sea 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.100
 subject to reliable events 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
 happening around him then everyone would 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.330
 believed in the history of the centurion small 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.760
 fiction would have been covered up by a huge 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.560
 reality in ryse son of rome to 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.569
 unfortunately there is no amount 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.580
 the historic cranberry game kratek such 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.740
 that she could write on her own 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.940
 scientific work with the analysis of all 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.600
 unreliability 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.770
 basic error of use 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.160
 cinematic techniques and stamps 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.640
 where they are completely unacceptable so 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.850
 Mary in a fit of anger scream shame nation 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.520
 hero through the action movie barbarians 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.200
 damn barbarians up 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.240
 a friend will surely die for 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.180
 extra motivation of the main character 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.880
 and any connection with reality will bring 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.520
 sacrifice entertainment however and the whole 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.500
 gameplay is built on the same model 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.430
 Mari Slash from monotonous barbarians 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.710
 right and left 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.900
 sometimes throw the enemy spears saw 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.240
 Mom and even less take command 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.880
 the legionâ€™s manipula often 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.220
 unjustified many enemies and appear 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.140
 not for a tick is not clear who could 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.420
 come to mind that deal with 4 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.390
 a row of barbarians in a row can be fun 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.520
 and it is interesting and even those Rosizo only volume 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.500
 that some wear shields and other bows 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.320
 the third two goals this is not counting 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.030
 standard with different then crowbar hands on 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.370
 throughout the game, marie will not get 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.590
 nothing new except for different variations 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.570
 shots that are true 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.520
 really beautiful and brutal 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.890
 all three he cut off the arms set 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.900
 head hides gladius am thoracic 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.660
 cells are all in terms of performance 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.550
 can easily be compared to battle scenes from 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.300
 tv series spartak gladiators would 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.100
 got jealous 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.050
 There are a lot of hits 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.660
 so that they do not bother you to the very 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.370
 the end of the boss battle game is boring 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.590
 and in some points they just 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.870
 annoying thing is that most 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.690
 bosses can deal damage only 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.850
 counterattack you can beat him 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.700
 gladius am but punch no defense 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.100
 It turns out because of this unjustifiably 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.140
 complexity rises and even more it 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.690
 worsened by some nuances of recording 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.240
 versions for example at the boss by the name of the throat 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.260
 there is a phase during which you need to press 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.970
 attack button 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.010
 for this you first need to activate 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.590
 certain trigger bringing health 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.690
 grotto half and beating off one of his 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.660
 punches and if you suddenly missed the right one 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.490
 moment and did not press the attack button then 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.130
 second time this trigger may just not 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.380
 work 0 and the throat will just get stuck on 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.330
 place in general ryse son of rome 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.180
 after transferring the record, I acquired several 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.010
 bugs and a certain imbalance 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.720
 interfering with the normal passage so still 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.820
 in the first mission of Mary when trying to enter 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.390
 the palace began to run in front of the entrance 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.610
 circle 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.550
 not responding to commands but after 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.740
 the fourth restart went to the door like 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.940
 nothing had happened to fight with the bosses 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.650
 using the keyboard and mouse 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.480
 despite a small amount of grease 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.760
 Mari objectively add 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.460
 evening with a gamepad but here's what kratek 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.400
 managed unconditionally so this is visual 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.290
 part of the game caledonian forest 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.450
 hopeless terrible rome majestic 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.850
 stone bedrooms on the italian plains 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.630
 all armor of the rest of the equipment 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.060
 traced in detail 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.770
 and even in the grim south coast 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.430
 britain can fall in love with the first 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.160
 glance 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.620
 besides rice to the front to the eyeballs 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.330
 crammed with plot rollers which 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.360
 Any modern could envy 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.210
 the game despite all its remnants of the edge 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.580
 Sanu from difficult to unequivocally 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.710
 let 's pour oh yeah look completely different 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.780
 prospects and as differently and 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.300
 perceive those who will play me 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.000
 for the sake of the atmosphere of the Roman Empire will receive 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.130
 completely different experience from those who 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.100
 run it for a bloody grinder and 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.010
 nevertheless the game attracts with something 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.450
 completely elusive maybe just that 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.520
 the story of mari 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.760
 after all, everyone is wondering what will happen to 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.200
 neuron because the truth is that all good luck and 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.200
 see you on playground.ru 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.629
 and becky g tank arming 100 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:33.360

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.650
 again go take the legs of the wines from the moon 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.650
 after buteyko 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.930
 and I do this 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.560
 like 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.560
 an aquarium
