00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
right better than anything I was gonna

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.340 
right better than anything I was gonna
buy<00:00:40.320> some<00:00:40.559> Ellen<00:00:40.860> crumbs<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:41.969> like

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
buy some Ellen crumbs and it was like

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
buy some Ellen crumbs and it was like
way<00:00:43.350> cheaper<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.910> bulbs<00:00:45.180> showing<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
way cheaper and the bulbs showing the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020 
way cheaper and the bulbs showing the
cost<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.950> eighth<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
cost like and in an eighth of what the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
head here that works good a little bit

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.999 
head here that works good a little bit
key<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.740> we've<00:01:22.860> got<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
key and then we're here we've got a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
key and then we're here we've got a
light<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.250> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> bouncing<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.360> kind

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
light that kind of is bouncing just kind

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.740 
light that kind of is bouncing just kind
of<00:01:24.830> ambient<00:01:25.830> Lee<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> room<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.659> not

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
of ambient Lee through the room it's not

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.330 
of ambient Lee through the room it's not
a<00:01:27.810> light<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> making<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.130> look

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
a light but it's kind of making it look

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.590 
a light but it's kind of making it look
like<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:29.970> bit<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like we have a little bit of you like

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
like we have a little bit of you like
falling<00:01:30.960> upon<00:01:31.259> us<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> light<00:01:31.829> isn't<00:01:31.979> so

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
falling upon us so the light isn't so

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.289 
falling upon us so the light isn't so
directional<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> fills<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.000> some<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
directional it fills in some of the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
directional it fills in some of the
shadows<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.229> anyway<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.610> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
shadows so anyway this is kind of one of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.679 
shadows so anyway this is kind of one of
the<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:35.909> lighting<00:01:36.090> techniques<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.540> have
