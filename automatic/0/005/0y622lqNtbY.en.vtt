you're hitting you know little rocks and
things<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.520> also<00:01:50.820> rolls<00:01:51.090> very

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
things like that but also rolls very

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.469 
things like that but also rolls very
efficiently<00:01:52.079> unlike<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> suspension

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
efficiently unlike you know a suspension
fork<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> very<00:01:55.470> efficient<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.060> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
fork so it's a very efficient way to to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
fork so it's a very efficient way to to
kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> dampen<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> impact<00:01:58.920> allows

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
kind of dampen some of the impact allows

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459 
kind of dampen some of the impact allows
you<00:01:59.610> pretty<00:01:59.969> low<00:02:00.240> gear<00:02:00.270> range<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.350> when

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you pretty low gear range so that when

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.260 
you pretty low gear range so that when
you<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> trails<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:03.030> able

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you do go out on the trails you're able

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
you do go out on the trails you're able
to<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.049> know<00:02:04.140> power<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.590> those<00:02:04.770> hills

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
to kind of you know power up those hills

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
to kind of you know power up those hills
as<00:02:05.579> well<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:06.000> hit<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> gas<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.810> flat<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
as well as hit the gas and the flat and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.669 
as well as hit the gas and the flat and
take<00:02:07.799> off<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.959> mount<00:02:10.259> actually

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
take off so this is a mount actually

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.199 
take off so this is a mount actually

the<00:02:16.320> leopard-skin<00:02:16.940> saddle<00:02:17.940> comes<00:02:18.870> extra

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the leopard-skin saddle comes extra

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020 
the leopard-skin saddle comes extra
that's<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.860> got<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.130> pay<00:02:20.280> extra<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.700> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
that's you got to pay extra for that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.790 
that's you got to pay extra for that
I'm<00:02:21.300> not<00:02:21.510> sure<00:02:21.690> how<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> came<00:02:21.990> into<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.470> saddle

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
I'm not sure how I came into the saddle

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
I'm not sure how I came into the saddle
but<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.550> bike<00:02:23.820> leopard-skin

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
but here it is on this bike leopard-skin

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320 
but here it is on this bike leopard-skin
so<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.680> guess<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.430> I'm<00:02:26.580> not<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.880> fast<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.270> a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
so I guess if I'm not as fast as a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.500 
so I guess if I'm not as fast as a
cheetah<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.990> look<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> dork<00:02:29.510> but

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
cheetah I just look like a dork but

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.590 
cheetah I just look like a dork but
that's<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.870> cyclocross<00:02:31.260> bike
