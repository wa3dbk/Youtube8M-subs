them start out you just drape it over
and<00:00:05.609> make<00:00:05.700> sure<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> points<00:00:06.330> match<00:00:06.589> four

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
and make sure that the points match four

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.879 
and make sure that the points match four
and<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> half<00:00:07.919> once<00:00:08.960> for<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.110> half<00:00:10.260> again<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
and a half once for it in half again and

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
and a half once for it in half again and
one<00:00:11.219> last<00:00:11.429> time<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.940> then<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.110> wind<00:00:13.320> up<00:00:13.410> with

one last time and then you wind up with

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.770 
one last time and then you wind up with
this<00:00:13.650> nice<00:00:13.860> straight<00:00:14.370> edge<00:00:14.549> stuff<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> into

your pocket if can bulge out just a
little<00:00:18.300> bit<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.109> ties<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.529> take

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
little bit just because the ties so take

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560 
little bit just because the ties so take
what<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.640> wind<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> pretty<00:00:21.210> legit

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
what you wind up with a pretty legit

what you wind up with a pretty legit
looking<00:00:21.869> straight<00:00:22.350> edge<00:00:22.470> full<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> then<00:00:23.910> they

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
looking straight edge full and then they

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
looking straight edge full and then they
other<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.410> right

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
other way that you can do it is right

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.970 
other way that you can do it is right
before<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.670> last<00:00:26.820> fold<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.779> half<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.380> you

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
before your last fold in half here you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.720 
before your last fold in half here you
just<00:00:29.160> take<00:00:30.199> at<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> center<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.859> flip<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
just take at the center here flip the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.180 
just take at the center here flip the
skinny<00:00:33.000> part<00:00:33.210> backwards<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:34.860> fold<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
skinny part backwards and then fold it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.720 
skinny part backwards and then fold it
in<00:00:35.280> half

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
in half

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
in half
and<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> does<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.840> make<00:00:36.989> sure<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and what that does is it make sure that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 
and what that does is it make sure that
each<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> these<00:00:37.800> sides<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.340> facing<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.120> same

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
each of these sides are facing the same

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
each of these sides are facing the same
way<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.410> adjust<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:40.890> bit

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
way and then just adjust it a little bit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
way and then just adjust it a little bit
forward<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.730> half<00:00:41.879> again<00:00:42.030> stuff<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.140> your

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
forward in half again stuff it in your

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.580 
forward in half again stuff it in your
pocket<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.280> 2.94<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:46.410> works

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
pocket and you get it a 2.94 that works

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590 
pocket and you get it a 2.94 that works
with<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:47.070> much<00:00:47.309> anytime<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> skinny

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
with it pretty much anytime the skinny

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
with it pretty much anytime the skinny
or<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> material<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.710> use<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
or the material that they use to make it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
or the material that they use to make it
the<00:00:50.460> better<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.390> fit<00:00:51.719> in

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the better just because it will fit in

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.750 
the better just because it will fit in
nicer<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:54.140> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> end<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:59.989> with

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.820 

faster

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
faster

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.280 
faster
to<00:01:06.830> your<00:01:06.920> point<00:01:07.130> mountain-fold<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:08.290> with

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290

to your point mountain-fold that with
just<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:09.590> little<00:01:09.680> bit<00:01:09.799> of<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.009> dusting<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.460> look

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
just a little bit of a dusting can look

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.700 
just a little bit of a dusting can look
like<00:01:11.270> ice<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.750> this<00:01:11.930> type<00:01:12.170> just<00:01:12.439> because

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710

what<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.369> like<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.610> do<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:50.479> take<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.050> two

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
what I like to do is you take the two

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.160 
what I like to do is you take the two
sides<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:51.860> on<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:53.000> point<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.990> five

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
sides of this on the point of the five

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.109 
sides of this on the point of the five
side<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.619> bring<00:01:55.100> them<00:01:55.250> into<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.640> center<00:01:55.909> so

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
side and bring them into the center so

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.340 
side and bring them into the center so
what<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.960> wind<00:01:57.170> up<00:01:57.289> with<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:59.289> basically<00:02:00.289> it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
what you wind up with is a basically it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.050 
what you wind up with is a basically it
winds<00:02:00.619> up<00:02:00.710> looking<00:02:00.860> like<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.399> skinny<00:02:01.670> side<00:02:01.909> of

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
winds up looking like the skinny side of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.630 
winds up looking like the skinny side of
your<00:02:02.149> type<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.740> fold<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.069> over<00:02:04.369> the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
your type and you fold that over the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.820 
your type and you fold that over the
back<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.539> not<00:02:05.929> just<00:02:06.080> make<00:02:06.289> sure<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.649> get<00:02:06.770> a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
back and not just make sure you get a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.969 
back and not just make sure you get a
little<00:02:07.009> bit<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.399> curve<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.360> bow<00:02:08.509> that

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
little bit of the curve of the bow that

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.199 
little bit of the curve of the bow that
typically<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> bow<00:02:10.190> tie<00:02:10.369> would<00:02:10.489> have<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.910> you

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
typically a bow tie would have and you

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.330 
typically a bow tie would have and you
also<00:02:11.390> make<00:02:11.660> sure<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.930> if<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.829> don't<00:02:13.040> do<00:02:13.250> that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
also make sure that if you don't do that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.920 
also make sure that if you don't do that
typically<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.060> wind<00:02:14.209> up<00:02:14.329> with<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.540> some

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
typically what you wind up with is some

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.240 
typically what you wind up with is some
with<00:02:15.079> the<00:02:15.170> tie<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.410> sticking<00:02:15.709> out<00:02:15.890> behind

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
with the tie it sticking out behind

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.949 
with the tie it sticking out behind
everything<00:02:16.640> else<00:02:16.910> when<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> crimp<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.480> which

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
everything else when you crimp it which

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.620 
everything else when you crimp it which
drives<00:02:18.200> me<00:02:18.290> nuts<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.519> take<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.480> two

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
drives me nuts so you just take the two

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.610 
drives me nuts so you just take the two
sides<00:02:21.100> pull<00:02:22.100> them<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.400> center<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.350> fold

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
sides pull them to the center and fold

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.350 
sides pull them to the center and fold
that<00:02:24.709> back

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.420 

and<00:02:28.780> just<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.650> he<00:02:29.740> shows<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> video<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
and just like he shows in the video you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.980 
and just like he shows in the video you
just<00:02:30.520> will<00:02:30.880> pop<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.570> get<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.870> your

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
just will pop that up to get you your

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.490 
just will pop that up to get you your
act<00:02:32.170> from<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.380> start<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> bow<00:02:33.220> shape<00:02:33.490> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
act from the start of the bow shape and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.430 
act from the start of the bow shape and
that's<00:02:36.360> basically<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> hardest<00:02:37.690> been<00:02:38.080> typing

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that's basically the hardest been typing

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.470 
that's basically the hardest been typing
in<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> hardest<00:02:38.950> part<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.340> other<00:02:40.000> thing<00:02:40.300> I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
in the hardest part the other thing I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.200 
in the hardest part the other thing I
did<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.840> an<00:02:40.960> addition<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.710> is<00:02:41.850> your<00:02:42.850> bending

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
did is an addition to it is your bending

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.870 
did is an addition to it is your bending
at<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.390> top<00:02:43.630> part<00:02:43.900> down<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.920> center<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
at the top part down to the center and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.730 
at the top part down to the center and
the<00:02:46.840> same<00:02:46.990> thing<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.350> bottom<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.680> just

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
the same thing on the bottom you just

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.350 
the same thing on the bottom you just
pull<00:02:48.010> them<00:02:48.130> both<00:02:48.310> up<00:02:48.490> towards<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.910> center<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
pull them both up towards the center and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
pull them both up towards the center and
that<00:02:49.390> starts<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.110> you're<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> little

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
that starts to get you you're a little

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.640 
that starts to get you you're a little
bit<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.740> bow<00:02:50.920> crimp<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.200> addressed<00:02:53.500> it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
bit of a bow crimp and just addressed it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.780 
bit of a bow crimp and just addressed it
a<00:02:53.680> little<00:02:53.830> bit<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.160> then<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.370> wind<00:02:54.550> up<00:02:54.670> with

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
a little bit so then you wind up with

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.560 
a little bit so then you wind up with
actual<00:02:55.150> bow<00:02:55.930> tie<00:02:56.110> shape<00:02:56.910> take<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.090> part<00:02:58.390> down

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
actual bow tie shape take this part down

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.160 
actual bow tie shape take this part down
the<00:02:59.560> skinny<00:02:59.830> side<00:03:00.010> just<00:03:00.220> drape<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.580> down<00:03:00.700> flat

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the skinny side just drape it down flat

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.520 
the skinny side just drape it down flat
from<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.200> top<00:03:02.470> straight<00:03:02.680> over<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.500> pull<00:03:05.500> it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
from the top straight over and pull it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.980 
from the top straight over and pull it
up<00:03:05.680> behind<00:03:05.950> everything<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.600> wind<00:03:07.750> up<00:03:07.840> with

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
up behind everything so you wind up with

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.600 
up behind everything so you wind up with
it<00:03:08.080> right<00:03:08.110> back<00:03:08.380> where<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.100> started<00:03:09.459> pretty

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
it right back where it started pretty

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.720 
it right back where it started pretty
much<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:11.280> that's<00:03:12.280> your<00:03:12.520> bow<00:03:12.640> shape<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:14.730> just

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
much and that's your bow shape and just

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.949 
much and that's your bow shape and just
like<00:03:15.850> he<00:03:15.940> says<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.270> video<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.630> pull<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
like he says in the video you pull the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.350 
like he says in the video you pull the
sides<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.740> and<00:03:18.450> there's<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.600> part<00:03:20.020> here<00:03:20.320> that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
sides in and there's this part here that

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.940 
sides in and there's this part here that
the<00:03:22.360> skinny<00:03:22.810> side<00:03:23.050> made<00:03:23.290> before<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> little

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the skinny side made before a little

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.130 
the skinny side made before a little
loop<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.970> just<00:03:25.150> pull<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> skinny<00:03:25.959> side

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
loop you just pull the skinny side

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.930 
loop you just pull the skinny side
through<00:03:26.410> there<00:03:26.560> again<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.520> what<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.790> does

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
through there again and what that does

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080 
through there again and what that does
is<00:03:28.090> lets<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.360> tighten<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:29.160> becomes<00:03:30.160> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
is lets you tighten it becomes the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.120 
is lets you tighten it becomes the
bottom<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.810> what<00:03:32.050> moves<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.950> tail

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
bottom and it is what moves the tail

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.100 
bottom and it is what moves the tail
won't<00:03:33.670> pull<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.940> top<00:03:34.209> end<00:03:34.450> actually<00:03:34.660> tighten

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
won't pull the top end actually tighten

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.320 
won't pull the top end actually tighten
up<00:03:35.170> what<00:03:35.320> you've<00:03:35.470> already<00:03:35.560> made<00:03:36.239> tighten<00:03:37.239> it

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
up what you've already made tighten it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.390 
up what you've already made tighten it
up<00:03:37.420> pretty<00:03:37.600> nicely<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.350> adjust<00:03:39.100> a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
up pretty nicely and just adjust a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:50.520 
up pretty nicely and just adjust a
little<00:03:39.640> bit

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.430 

and<00:03:51.010> then<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.850> wind<00:03:52.030> up<00:03:52.180> with<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.690> fairly<00:03:53.140> legit

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
and then you wind up with a fairly legit

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.460 
and then you wind up with a fairly legit
looking<00:03:53.890> boat<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.660> took<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.780> skinny<00:03:56.020> side<00:03:56.230> back

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
looking boat I took the skinny side back

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.990 
looking boat I took the skinny side back
in<00:03:56.650> there<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.070> you're<00:03:57.610> done<00:03:58.230> pretty<00:03:59.230> simple<00:03:59.590> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
in there and you're done pretty simple I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.270 
in there and you're done pretty simple I
said<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.240> looks<00:04:02.080> fairly<00:04:02.470> legit<00:04:02.770> it's<00:04:03.130> not

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
said it looks fairly legit it's not

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.500 
said it looks fairly legit it's not
perfect<00:04:03.610> but<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:04.090> mean<00:04:04.450> compared<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:06.390> based<00:04:07.390> on

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
perfect but I mean compared to based on

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.670 
perfect but I mean compared to based on
the<00:04:07.600> fact<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.959> it's<00:04:08.050> made<00:04:08.140> with<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.410> legit

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
the fact that it's made with a legit

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.610 
the fact that it's made with a legit
tack<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.160> works<00:04:09.310> very<00:04:09.400> well
