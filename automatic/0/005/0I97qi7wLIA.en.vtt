00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.160
 Instead of giving us easy is it to explore the area blotter consists of media representatives bite 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.850
 I'm back 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.379
 Oh, I'm going to take the format a little shorter in the future. 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.589
 I am going to increase the number of people who can understand easily . 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:25.259
 This week's topic has brought virtual reality. 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:29.640
 We say we are usually v. We talk about the first Real Neck Tie . 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:33.240
 In recent years, Samsung Gear vero Kel Ross later 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.890
 As a Google card board sony guitar and so on 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:42.330
 VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES HAVE A LOT OF HEADSET 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 So, you know , I 'll show you one thing: Google's cardboard 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:53.280
 A virtual reality headset that makes it very easy 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 But why do not you wonder why you are suddenly taking a virtual cg 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.070
 Actually, Mr. Hyun was born in 1938 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:06.659
 I was told that I had the word " ah " 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.799
 The research began in the 1960s and early 1990s, 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.399
 2000s 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.640
 The device came out, and I had a failure. 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:19.049
 But why is virtual reality coming back up now? 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.569
 I'm not curious about this. 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.200
 Let's go first . What is virtual reality? 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:26.460
 Oh, I'll try to clean up once since this part is that I clean up 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.069
 It's not. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.299
 It's literally a virtual move. 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:36.359
 But instead of four teeth matters is the reality created to embellish your computer 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.619
 I think we can do this sort of thing. 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:42.450
 But it's like geureongeo 4 characters to talk to me this three keywords: 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.209
 I pulled it . 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.560
 First, the channel is called Layer. Second is called Second Life. 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.069
 Service is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:59.039
 And the third is the Oculus lift. 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:03.630
 5 + 1 fta and check out this up-and-coming one while watching our world 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.270
 The number will be party to give the word from the re-run first followed by Rennes 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.959
 Who will have time restraint layer 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:19.709
 Now before the first virtual reality is the person who wrote the words in 1938. What 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:22.830
 The first class mates Mowers French playwright from the novel that I wrote 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:27.420
 Cancer Toning a Talking about me again. 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:32.700
 Oh , it was a little difficult. 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:37.230
 But who is it that this virtual reality has been properly communicated to the most public? 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 That person is a computer scientist called Mamiya, and Ahiram 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.880
 I was born in 1960. 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:48.150
 In 1985, vp 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:53.310
 Create the Institute of el br So what is to be produced O 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:59.400
 And then start making br songs. 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.200
 And it started in the 8th of 1990s so virtual reality was very popular at the time. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.410
 I got it. 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.270
 But there's not much to hear from that place . 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.030
 And this guy is currently working on ms research 3 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.760
 We are making it strong. 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.150
 Let's get popular this way 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.250
 Then again , we will come in the 2000s so we need to know 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.000
 It's a second light. 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:29.610
 Do you remember many of Second Life ? 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.260
 I know why you are so much more than you are. 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.810
 What is Second Life in Linden Web, published in 2003 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.950
 Virtual reality service 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:47.310
 To be one month out together how well I also called this game 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:51.750
 There were 900,000 people, and the circulation of currency 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.500
 Even if the scale in which 500 000 006 000 5 up to now no ttajimyeon 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.170
 It was pretty good. 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:03.620
 But now 4 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:07.820
 Now the site is still alive instead of the biggest virtual reality case 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:12.860
 It is this Second Life that is not missed when it is mentioned 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.950
 Now Oakley o clust version is also available 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.299
 It's the third Oculus lift. 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:26.150
 Why do we need a 5 + 5 lift to get a virtual reality? 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:30.230
 We need to confirm the oculus lift in order to catch our hint 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.460
 I think that 's the price of Zhao Cross's feet. 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.520
 Do you know 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.180
 4 2:00 $ 100 there is $ 400 with our money 1 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:43.400
 I'll spend about 500,000 won for 200,000 won. 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:48.500
 Now a similar or Ah 10 years ago to 10 years ago. 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.210
 If you say that you create a headset with this virtual city Spain, 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.520
 done 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.350
 It was 8,000 dollars. If we use our money, it is almost 10 million won 3 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.449
 Level of 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:08.360
 It's the price. It was that expensive. But what does this Oculus lift do ? 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:10.789
 This device, which can be enjoyed at the most popular prices at the lowest price 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.860
 I created it. 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:18.470
 And to make the same old dies Singh told this is a significant cost 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.270
 It 's replacing it with a smartphone. 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:29.000
 That's how virtual reality is reviving right now . 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:33.770
 As a professional and not a general evaluation of the media, including the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.240
 Well, I've been looking at virtual reality for a while. 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.259
 How did you help me understand why you're going to go right now? 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.259
 I do not know 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.530
 Here jjalgin but I will finish, so Joe 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.530
 thank 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.460
 on 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.409
 wei 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.409
 U
