00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
dry it out before you turn it back guy

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
dry it out before you turn it back guy
weighs<00:01:47.759> about<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> same<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.810> Petzl<00:01:49.170> 83

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
weighs about the same as the Petzl 83

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980 
weighs about the same as the Petzl 83
grams<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> feels<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.299> comfortable<00:01:51.869> on

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
grams and it feels really comfortable on

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
grams and it feels really comfortable on
the<00:01:52.170> head<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.920> does<00:01:53.250> also<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.970> single

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the head it does also have the single

the head it does also have the single
push<00:01:54.630> button<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:55.200> top<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> does<00:01:56.189> adjust<00:01:56.759> up

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
push button up top and it does adjust up

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.690 
push button up top and it does adjust up
and<00:01:57.329> down<00:01:57.560> just<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> Petzl<00:01:59.310> although<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and down just like the Petzl although it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.160 
and down just like the Petzl although it
doesn't<00:01:59.909> adjust<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.630> easily

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
doesn't adjust as easily

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620 
doesn't adjust as easily
you<00:02:02.100> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> got<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> work<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.509> bit

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you kind of got it work it a little bit

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.440 
you kind of got it work it a little bit
more<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.280> harder<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:05.790> one

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
more so it's a little harder with one

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.449 
more so it's a little harder with one
handed<00:02:06.899> usually<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.770> stick<00:02:07.979> two<00:02:08.129> hands

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
handed usually I have to stick two hands

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.490 
handed usually I have to stick two hands
up<00:02:08.580> here<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> adjust<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
up here to get it to adjust with the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
up here to get it to adjust with the
Petzl<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.069> kind<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.430> flip<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.760> with

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
Petzl you can kind of just flip it with

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.500 
Petzl you can kind of just flip it with
one<00:02:12.180> hand

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
one hand

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.539 
one hand
but<00:02:13.080> once<00:02:13.290> you've<00:02:13.409> got<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.620> set<00:02:13.769> there<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.370> will

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
but once you've got it set there it will

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.339 
but once you've got it set there it will
stay<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:15.060> some<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> guys<00:02:16.049> might

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
stay there some of you guys might

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.009 
stay there some of you guys might

videos<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.720> use<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.709> lamp<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.640> has<00:02:23.909> served

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
videos I use this lamp so it has served

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.410 
videos I use this lamp so it has served
me<00:02:24.959> well<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.920> another<00:02:26.189> great<00:02:26.519> addition

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420

to<00:02:27.540> my<00:02:27.629> kit<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.500> taking<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.829> look<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
to my kit so taking a look at the

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.220 
to my kit so taking a look at the
operation<00:02:29.760> here<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.120> basically<00:02:30.269> just<00:02:30.540> press

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
operation here you basically just press

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.259 
operation here you basically just press
it<00:02:31.409> once<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.670> long<00:02:32.909> hold

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
it once you do not have to long hold

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.390 
it once you do not have to long hold
which<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.510> kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.900> nice<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.829> Petzl<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.310> have

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
which is kind of nice the Petzl you have

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.280 
which is kind of nice the Petzl you have
to<00:02:35.519> long<00:02:35.730> hold<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.510> one<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:36.900> press

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
to long hold this one you just press

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.470 
to long hold this one you just press
once<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.829> then<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.190> basically<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:39.000> keep

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
once and then you basically just keep

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
once and then you basically just keep
pressing<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.829> will<00:02:40.950> cycle<00:02:41.220> through

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
pressing it and it will cycle through

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
pressing it and it will cycle through
the<00:02:42.180> modes<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.319> see<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.680> there's<00:02:43.890> three

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the modes you can see that there's three

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
the modes you can see that there's three
little<00:02:44.640> LEDs<00:02:45.030> over<00:02:45.329> there<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.170> over

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
little LEDs over there and then one over

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
little LEDs over there and then one over
there<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.549> basically<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.269> single<00:02:48.659> press

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
there so basically with a single press

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.199 
there so basically with a single press
you<00:02:49.079> can<00:02:49.230> operate<00:02:49.709> those<00:02:49.950> two<00:02:50.220> modes<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.760> then

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
you can operate those two modes and then

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.240 
you can operate those two modes and then
if<00:02:51.299> you<00:02:51.389> hold<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.750> down<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.409> will<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.829> over<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
if you hold it down it will go over to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.099 
if you hold it down it will go over to
the<00:02:53.609> other<00:02:53.819> side<00:02:54.150> where<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.569> have<00:02:54.780> two

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
the other side where you have two

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.319 
the other side where you have two
brightness<00:02:55.590> modes<00:02:55.859> as<00:02:56.099> well<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.790> two

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
brightness modes as well so two

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.449 
brightness modes as well so two
brightness<00:02:57.750> modes<00:02:57.959> over<00:02:58.260> there<00:02:58.409> hold<00:02:59.129> it<00:02:59.310> down

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
brightness modes over there hold it down

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.490 
brightness modes over there hold it down
and<00:02:59.819> you<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.150> two<00:03:00.389> brightness<00:03:00.840> modes<00:03:01.109> over

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
and you have two brightness modes over

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.250 
and you have two brightness modes over
there<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.700> four<00:03:02.970> modes<00:03:03.180> altogether<00:03:03.840> two<00:03:04.109> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
there so four modes altogether two on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.190 
there so four modes altogether two on
this<00:03:04.409> side<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.889> two<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.639> that<00:03:05.940> side<00:03:06.000> or<00:03:06.720> three

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
this side and two on that side or three

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.229 
this side and two on that side or three
modes<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:08.069> burst<00:03:08.310> alright<00:03:08.790> guys<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.209> let's

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
modes and a burst alright guys so let's

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.270 
modes and a burst alright guys so let's
take<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.599> look<00:03:09.870> at<00:03:10.049> some<00:03:10.260> night<00:03:10.500> shots<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:11.099> the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.780 
that I'm on the lowest mode which is
still<00:03:26.579> pretty<00:03:26.819> decent<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.329> mean<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.599> can<00:03:27.780> see

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
still pretty decent I mean I can see

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.400 
still pretty decent I mean I can see
let's<00:03:29.790> kick<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.060> up<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.389> notch<00:03:30.419> to<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.109> next

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
let's kick it up a notch to the next

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.289 
let's kick it up a notch to the next
mode<00:03:31.889> there<00:03:34.609> then<00:03:35.609> well<00:03:35.819> it's<00:03:35.940> pretty<00:03:36.150> good

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
mode there then well it's pretty good

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.150 
mode there then well it's pretty good
and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:36.629> we<00:03:36.720> can<00:03:36.870> switch<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.109> over<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.590> our

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
and then we can switch it over to our

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460 
and then we can switch it over to our
brighter<00:03:39.030> settings<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:40.169> have<00:03:40.199> one

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
brighter settings you have one

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.000 
brighter settings you have one
brightness<00:03:40.919> setting<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:43.410> get<00:03:43.590> back<00:03:43.769> to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
brightness setting there and get back to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.349 
brightness setting there and get back to
it<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:45.410> then<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.940> brightest

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
it and then you have the brightest

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.180 
it and then you have the brightest
setting<00:03:48.540> there<00:03:48.900> which<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.230> 120<00:03:49.919> lumens

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.280 

so<00:03:53.190> anywhere<00:03:53.520> in<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.700> hundred<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.540> 150

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
so anywhere in that hundred to 150

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.280 
so anywhere in that hundred to 150
lumens<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:56.239> think<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.360> plenty<00:03:57.569> for<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> headlamp

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
lumens I think is plenty for a headlamp

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.710 
lumens I think is plenty for a headlamp
you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.400> definitely<00:03:59.580> see<00:04:00.030> around<00:04:00.330> your<00:04:00.480> camp

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
you can definitely see around your camp

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.440 
you can definitely see around your camp
real<00:04:00.989> well<00:04:01.970> can<00:04:02.970> definitely<00:04:05.120> make<00:04:06.120> your<00:04:06.300> way

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450

real well can definitely make your way
around<00:04:06.599> really<00:04:07.140> well<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.400> don't<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.760> to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
around really well and you don't have to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.440 
around really well and you don't have to
be<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.180> brightest<00:04:09.510> setting<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.900> all<00:04:11.450> you

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.530 
be on the brightest setting at all you
just<00:04:12.480> shot<00:04:12.870> up<00:04:13.020> at<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.260> trees<00:04:13.500> here<00:04:17.540> so

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
just shot up at the trees here so

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.129 
just shot up at the trees here so
definitely<00:04:19.290> plenty<00:04:19.919> bright<00:04:20.250> enough

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
now this one doesn't have any strobe

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.399 
now this one doesn't have any strobe
modes<00:04:28.150> or<00:04:28.330> anything<00:04:28.599> like<00:04:28.719> that<00:04:28.749> just<00:04:29.199> the

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
modes or anything like that just the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:37.499 
modes or anything like that just the
floor<00:04:29.680> levels<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.819> brightness<00:04:36.389> alright<00:04:37.389> guys
