00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
so I'm going to give you a quick tour of

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.550 
so I'm going to give you a quick tour of
the<00:00:24.070> roster<00:00:25.770> here<00:00:26.770> we<00:00:26.890> have<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:27.190> cooling<00:00:27.580> tray

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the roster here we have the cooling tray

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.960 
the roster here we have the cooling tray
with<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.680> cooling<00:00:30.010> mechanism<00:00:30.550> on<00:00:30.670> the<00:00:30.820> right

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
with the cooling mechanism on the right

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:39.090 
with the cooling mechanism on the right
there<00:00:31.240> you<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:33.940> simple<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:38.590> I<00:00:38.710> call<00:00:38.950> it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
there you have a simple which I call it

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.150 
there you have a simple which I call it
a<00:00:39.250> Trier<00:00:43.290> opening<00:00:44.290> mechanism<00:00:44.440> pretty<00:00:45.400> basic

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
a Trier opening mechanism pretty basic

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.400 
a Trier opening mechanism pretty basic
it<00:00:48.160> only<00:00:48.460> have<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.660> don't<00:00:49.870> have<00:00:49.989> three

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
it only have you don't have three

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.950 
it only have you don't have three
switches<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:51.070> time<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:52.300> have<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.690> main

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
switches this time you have the main

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.390 
switches this time you have the main
power<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:54.220> drum<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.750> fan<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:57.160> cannot

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
power the drum and the fan you cannot

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.790 
power the drum and the fan you cannot
adjust<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.629> fan<00:00:58.809> it's<00:00:58.989> only<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.500> an<00:00:59.680> off

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
adjust the fan it's only on an off

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.979 
adjust the fan it's only on an off
switch<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:01.030> have<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.269> use<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.659> mechanical

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
switch you have to use the mechanical

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.620 
switch you have to use the mechanical
damper<00:01:02.559> in<00:01:02.680> order<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.070> control<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.730> air<00:01:03.760> flow

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.390 

here<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.720> have<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.990> bt<00:01:11.320> temperature<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
here you have the bt temperature and the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.760 
here you have the bt temperature and the
ET<00:01:12.790> temperature<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.510> one<00:01:13.690> is<00:01:13.810> programmable

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
ET temperature this one is programmable

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.600 
ET temperature this one is programmable
so<00:01:15.159> I<00:01:15.190> can<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.659> follow<00:01:16.840> up<00:01:17.250> program<00:01:18.250> which

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
so I can make it follow up program which

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.360 
so I can make it follow up program which
we're<00:01:18.760> going<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.970> do<00:01:19.060> today<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.159> we're<00:01:21.280> going

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
we're going to do today so we're going

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.490 
we're going to do today so we're going
to<00:01:21.460> go<00:01:21.550> for<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> roasting<00:01:22.180> time<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.630> about<00:01:22.960> 11

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
to go for a roasting time of about 11

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.630 
to go for a roasting time of about 11
minutes<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.070> 45<00:01:24.970> seconds<00:01:25.329> hopefully<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.640> will

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
minutes and 45 seconds hopefully I will

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.590 
minutes and 45 seconds hopefully I will
just<00:01:27.820> start<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:29.610> preset<00:01:30.610> program<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.360> just

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
just start the preset program and just

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.929 
just start the preset program and just
keep<00:01:31.899> it<00:01:32.049> on<00:01:32.200> hold<00:01:32.860> until<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.219> have<00:01:33.490> reached

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
keep it on hold until I have reached

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.170 
keep it on hold until I have reached
entire<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:35.079> desired<00:01:35.469> temperature<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:36.310> 190

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
entire the desired temperature of 190

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.459 
entire the desired temperature of 190
degrees<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.700> now<00:01:42.850> both<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.420> fan<00:01:43.719> and<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
degrees so now both the fan and the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.429 
degrees so now both the fan and the
motor<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.860> running

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
motor is running

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.130 
motor is running
and<00:01:47.090> what<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.359> here<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.749> basically

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and what you can see here is basically

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.859 
and what you can see here is basically
the<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.369> idea<00:01:50.670> regulator<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.299> trying<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.659> hold

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the the idea regulator is trying to hold

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:06.330 
the the idea regulator is trying to hold
the<00:01:52.079> temperature<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:52.740> 190<00:01:53.700> degrees

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.960 

yep<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.450> think<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.349> can<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.800> start<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.489> program

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
yep I think we can just start it program

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.440 
yep I think we can just start it program
now<00:02:10.739> seven<00:02:11.739> minutes<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:13.360> press<00:02:13.599> run<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
now seven minutes in we press run and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:26.680 
now seven minutes in we press run and
then<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.750> beauty<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.140> y'all

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:36.660 

and<00:02:26.840> charge

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.320 

the<00:02:37.180> et<00:02:37.540> drug<00:02:37.870> temperature<00:02:38.440> drops<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:40.270> you

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
the et drug temperature drops as you

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.140 
the et drug temperature drops as you
probably<00:02:40.720> know<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.350> first<00:02:41.590> couple<00:02:42.040> of

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
probably know the first couple of

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:59.290 
probably know the first couple of
minutes<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:45.010> trying<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.630> regain<00:02:46.680> itself

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.520 

oh<00:02:59.360> crap

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.720 

Oh<00:03:04.620> Bradley<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.400> forgot<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.880> press<00:03:06.420> run<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.370> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
Oh Bradley I forgot to press run so in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.990 
Oh Bradley I forgot to press run so in
order<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.150> compensate<00:03:09.420> they're<00:03:09.959> gonna

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
order to compensate they're gonna

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:26.220 
order to compensate they're gonna
reprogram<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> bit

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.360 

since<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:26.920> are<00:03:27.040> friendly<00:03:27.340> forgot<00:03:27.760> to

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:40.710 

um

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.619 

so<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:42.110> just<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.650> repro<00:03:43.010> program<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:44.269> order<00:03:44.450> to

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
so I just a repro program in order to

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.400 
so I just a repro program in order to
cut<00:03:45.049> back<00:03:47.260> cut<00:03:48.260> back<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.620> time

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
cut back cut back the time

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.850 
cut back cut back the time
we<00:03:50.740> are<00:03:50.890> 4<00:03:51.430> degrees<00:03:52.060> off<00:03:52.330> by<00:03:52.720> what<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.500> want<00:03:53.710> but

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
we are 4 degrees off by what we want but

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.550 
we are 4 degrees off by what we want but
the<00:03:54.010> idea<00:03:54.310> regular<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.850> be<00:03:54.970> we<00:03:55.930> just<00:03:55.960> have<00:03:56.380> fun

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
the idea regular to be we just have fun

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.820 
the idea regular to be we just have fun
and<00:03:56.740> 50<00:03:57.100> degrees<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:58.020> my<00:03:59.020> guess<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.530> we

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
and 50 degrees and my guess is that we

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.940 
and 50 degrees and my guess is that we
can<00:04:00.040> start<00:04:00.280> seeing<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.880> beans<00:04:01.120> turning<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.950> bit

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
can start seeing the beans turning a bit

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.970 
can start seeing the beans turning a bit
green<00:04:04.620> yeah

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:25.159 

even<00:04:11.760> brownish<00:04:12.420> color

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.900 

half<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:26.370> green

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
half the green

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
half the green
field<00:04:28.510> in<00:04:28.980> artisan<00:04:29.980> program

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.830 

still<00:04:35.680> no<00:04:35.950> sign<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.970> maybe<00:04:37.780> there<00:04:38.140> is

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.710 

oh<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.710> can<00:04:42.669> hear<00:04:42.790> first<00:04:43.090> crack
