00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 channel today we will make a bracelet 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.639
 in watercolor technique with flowers 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.849
 the bracelet is made very simple but 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.980
 Looks interesting. We take two colors. 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.160
 translucent plastics I would choose 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.890
 purple red and also ordinary colors 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.269
 it's purple and white make from 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.119
 translucent plastic two triangles 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.669
 connecting them this i do in order to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.860
 make a smooth color transition to 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.860
 turned out to be a beautiful interesting gradient 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 Here is my gradient turned out 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.270
 when mixing purple red as well 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 I prepared white 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.120
 layer and purple layer now they need 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.140
 all combine and make a sandwich of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780
 polymer clay 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.360
 the first layer we have is purple then white 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.480
 and we are already laying our gradient on white 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.449
 from translucent plastic we roll 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.610
 his either a skalonka or a post machine what 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.610
 turned out to be about 2 millimeters thick 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.299
 now we live this layer into small ones 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.700
 the pieces make them as small as possible 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.310
 as we have flowers will be small and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.549
 large pieces will not be very beautiful 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.100
 look add up all the color 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.100
 order so as not to get confused 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.080
 I have already prepared a layer of purple 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.630
 polymer clay about the thickness of his 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.700
 3-4 millimeters and begin to spread 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.620
 these pieces are on each other 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.970
 make it so small 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.350
 overlap so that it can be seen that under the red 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.170
 we also have white purple layers 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.550
 at first I just tore to pieces and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.490
 put on the table to us now I decided 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.200
 just tear straight from that reservoir and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.960
 immediately lay in so it seems to me 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.880
 faster and more convenient for me 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.570
 I spread also from red to 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.570
 purple 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.500
 All laid out and now just left 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.560
 roll the rolling pin that the surface became 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.110
 smooth and smooth now covering 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.100
 package food and with which 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.100
 carves flowers 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.519
 now that all the flowers are ready 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.310
 make holes in them in which we 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.829
 We will insert with you the lace do it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.379
 first with a needle and after taking 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.510
 toothpick and already a toothpick expanding 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.189
 this hole is now sending all 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.829
 flowers baked in the oven when 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.620
 110 degrees just 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.590
 20 minutes after the flowers cool down 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.079
 I can cover them with varnish 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.480
 it is possible not to cover at all so 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.829
 we now need our assemblies for 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.439
 lacquered flowers 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.540
 elastic transparent white transparent 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.540
 bead glue moment and scissors 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.949
 cut off a small piece of gum and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.310
 starting to collect bracelet 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:30.260
 first there is a flower and then a bead 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.379
 again flower and everything is in order 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.569
 pokleit and I laid out the flowers in the center 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.500
 reds and already edges of me 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.500
 turns purple 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.209
 the bracelet turned out to be a little big and 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.900
 so I remove one bead and one 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.330
 flower connects the two ends and tie 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.009
 2 knots 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.389
 tighten willow tighter so they don't 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:36.090
 untied on the knot digging glue 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:42.530
 moment so that the bundle is definitely not ours 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:46.610
 unleashed cutting off unnecessary ends and 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.610
 hiding them in a flower 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.229
 help yourself is by using needles and 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.099
 then just pull up a little 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.750
 bracelets knot itself hide in a flower 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.729
 you can't even find where we had this 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.870
 knot as it stuck with us 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.909
 inside the flower try to make yourself 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.210
 some decoration in watercolor technique 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.830
 technique is very interesting and simple 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.289
 as you can see the bracelet turned out very bright 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.419
 spring joyful hope you 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.080
 liked my master class
