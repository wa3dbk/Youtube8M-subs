my first skincare routine video because

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
my first skincare routine video because
I<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.529> sunscreen<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.820> most

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I just think that sunscreen is the most

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
I just think that sunscreen is the most
important<00:00:33.840> step<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.500> skincare<00:00:34.829> routine

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
important step in your skincare routine

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.389 
important step in your skincare routine
some<00:00:36.120> people<00:00:36.450> ask<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> keep

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
some people ask me what you do to keep

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
some people ask me what you do to keep
your<00:00:38.579> skin<00:00:38.879> looking<00:00:38.910> nice<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.440> useful

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
your skin looking nice and very useful

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.639 
your skin looking nice and very useful
and<00:00:41.370> my<00:00:41.640> answer<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.450> wear<00:00:42.870> sunscreen<00:00:43.200> all

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and my answer is I wear sunscreen all

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.420 
and my answer is I wear sunscreen all
the<00:00:43.950> time

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the time

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
the time
I<00:00:44.460> worry<00:00:44.910> even<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:46.110> sunny<00:00:46.469> outside

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I worry even if it's not sunny outside

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.950 
I worry even if it's not sunny outside
which<00:00:47.160> afforded<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> case<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> London

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
which afforded the case here in London

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.889 
which afforded the case here in London
even<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.920> raining<00:00:50.190> snowing<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.480> even

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
even when it's raining snowing or even

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
even when it's raining snowing or even
when<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.170> popping<00:00:52.500> outside<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.250> five

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
when I'm popping outside for like five

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
when I'm popping outside for like five
minutes<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.989> essential

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
minutes I just think that it's essential

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.709 
minutes I just think that it's essential
for<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.640> protect<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.210> skin<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.510> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
plus plus plus I think I have been

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450 
plus plus plus I think I have been
wearing<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.510> would<00:01:09.930> say<00:01:10.260> since<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.340> in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
wearing this I would say since I was in

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
wearing this I would say since I was in
sixth<00:01:11.820> form<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.360> that's<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:13.159> six<00:01:14.159> years<00:01:14.250> ago

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
sixth form so that's like six years ago

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
sixth form so that's like six years ago
the<00:01:15.090> reason<00:01:15.450> why<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.080> using<00:01:16.650> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the reason why I have been using this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760 
the reason why I have been using this
constantly<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.689> too<00:01:19.470> oily

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
constantly is because it's not too oily

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.160 
constantly is because it's not too oily
but<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.700> moisturizing<00:01:21.450> enough<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but it's kind of moisturizing enough to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
but it's kind of moisturizing enough to
put<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.560> before<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:23.159> foundation<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.060> being<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
put on before my foundation and being a
