00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.020 

so<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:47.690> need<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.320> then<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.650> need<00:01:48.830> some

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
so you need that and then you need some

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.670 
so you need that and then you need some
sand<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.540> mean<00:01:50.840> obviously<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.470> don't<00:01:51.560> have

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
sand I mean obviously you don't have

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.380 
sand I mean obviously you don't have
touched<00:01:51.950> ham<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:52.340> I'm<00:01:52.550> just<00:01:52.880> showing<00:01:53.120> you<00:01:53.150> my

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
touched ham but I'm just showing you my

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.480 
touched ham but I'm just showing you my
way<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.750> potty<00:01:53.990> training<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:54.620> do<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:55.190> stand

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
way of potty training and I do you stand

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.920 
way of potty training and I do you stand
because<00:01:55.990> forest<00:01:56.990> adores<00:01:58.330> sand<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.750> sand

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
because forest adores sand and sand

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.480 
because forest adores sand and sand
baths<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.650> it's<00:02:00.800> another<00:02:01.100> kind<00:02:01.370> of

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
baths and so it's another kind of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.840 
baths and so it's another kind of
attractant<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.360> get<00:02:02.540> her<00:02:02.810> into<00:02:03.650> her<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:04.610> use

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
attractant to get her into her to use

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.830 
attractant to get her into her to use
her<00:02:05.120> litter<00:02:05.300> box<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.900> also<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:07.539> helps<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.689> lot

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
her litter box and also it helps a lot

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.229 
her litter box and also it helps a lot
to<00:02:08.899> absorb<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.649> urine<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.819> makes<00:02:11.000> for

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
to absorb the urine so it makes for

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.530 
to absorb the urine so it makes for
easier<00:02:11.719> cleaning<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
easier cleaning and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.990 
easier cleaning and
so<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:13.810> way<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.019> do<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.310> get

okay this is two handfuls when you're
starting<00:03:39.819> out<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.120> would<00:03:40.419> put<00:03:40.659> like<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.079> little

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
starting out I would put like a little

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.640 
starting out I would put like a little
bit<00:03:41.560> more<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.310> kind<00:03:42.609> of<00:03:42.699> make<00:03:42.909> it<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.650> little

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
bit more in and kind of make it a little

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.710 
bit more in and kind of make it a little
higher<00:03:45.040> up<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.579> corner<00:03:45.970> because<00:03:46.329> that's

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
higher up in the corner because that's

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.390 
higher up in the corner because that's
where<00:03:46.959> they're<00:03:47.109> gonna<00:03:47.260> go<00:03:47.530> pee<00:03:48.159> and<00:03:49.229> then<00:03:50.400> so

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
where they're gonna go pee and then so

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.420 
where they're gonna go pee and then so
that's<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.970> first<00:03:52.209> step<00:03:52.449> is<00:03:52.690> preparing<00:03:53.430> your

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
that's the first step is preparing your

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.449 
that's the first step is preparing your
own<00:03:54.810> litter<00:03:55.810> tray<00:03:56.139> and<00:03:56.379> then<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.919> next<00:03:57.220> step

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
own litter tray and then the next step

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.399 
own litter tray and then the next step
and<00:03:57.639> this<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:57.849> like<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.419> most<00:03:58.629> important<00:03:59.139> step

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
and this is like the most important step

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.119 
and this is like the most important step
is<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.959> want<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.199> place<00:04:02.439> it<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.799> corner

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
is that you want to place it in a corner

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.069 
is that you want to place it in a corner
so<00:04:03.519> even<00:04:03.849> if<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.090> have<00:04:04.359> one<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.569> those<00:04:04.750> dome

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
so even if you have one of those dome

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.369 
so even if you have one of those dome
shaped<00:04:05.970> litters<00:04:06.970> things<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.689> want<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.109> put<00:04:08.290> it

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
shaped litters things you want to put it

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.309 
shaped litters things you want to put it
in<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.590> corner<00:04:08.829> because<00:04:09.699> for<00:04:10.120> some<00:04:10.269> reason

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
in a corner because for some reason

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.800 
in a corner because for some reason
hamsters<00:04:12.000> always<00:04:13.000> go<00:04:13.150> potty<00:04:13.329> in<00:04:13.479> the<00:04:13.540> corner

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
hamsters always go potty in the corner

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.620 
hamsters always go potty in the corner
and<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.739> you<00:04:14.799> if<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.669> put<00:04:15.849> it<00:04:15.939> in<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.150> center

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
and so you if you put it in the center

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.979 
and so you if you put it in the center
here<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.259> may<00:04:17.979> like<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.820> or<00:04:19.449> something<00:04:19.840> you

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
here you may like this or something you

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.949 
here you may like this or something you
may<00:04:20.139> have<00:04:20.169> problems<00:04:20.889> with<00:04:21.070> her<00:04:21.280> using<00:04:21.549> it

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
may have problems with her using it

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.960 
may have problems with her using it
you<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:22.919> want<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.250> put<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.669> corner

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
you really want to put it in a corner

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.999 
you really want to put it in a corner
and<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.930> always<00:04:25.470> clear<00:04:25.889> out<00:04:26.100> all<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.699> bedding

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
and I always clear out all the bedding

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.180 
and I always clear out all the bedding
in<00:04:29.009> that<00:04:29.250> corner<00:04:30.020> so<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.259> sits<00:04:31.500> flat<00:04:31.889> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
in that corner so that it sits flat and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.790 
in that corner so that it sits flat and
doesn't<00:04:32.520> move<00:04:32.610> around<00:04:32.849> or<00:04:33.090> tip<00:04:33.240> over<00:04:33.539> and<00:04:33.840> then

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
doesn't move around or tip over and then
