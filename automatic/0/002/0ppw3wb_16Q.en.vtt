injured with this type of injury and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
injured with this type of injury and
they're<00:00:36.540> injured<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.020> long<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.010> type

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
they're injured for this long the type

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.000 
they're injured for this long the type
of<00:00:38.250> injury<00:00:38.750> affects<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> overall<00:00:40.410> rating<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of injury affects the overall rating and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.750 
of injury affects the overall rating and
the<00:00:41.489> duration<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.450> obviously<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> duration

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
the duration is obviously the duration

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
the duration is obviously the duration
so<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.000> easy<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:46.320> rid<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so the easy way to get rid of all of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.709 
so the easy way to get rid of all of
this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.590> find<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> replace<00:00:50.719> go

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this is to go to find and replace go

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.830 
this is to go to find and replace go
find<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.379> ID<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.699> greater<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.690> equal
