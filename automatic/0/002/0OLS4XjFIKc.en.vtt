two beautifully and the second reason I
became<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> nurse<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.880> grandmother<00:01:15.360> my

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
became a nurse was my grandmother my

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
became a nurse was my grandmother my
mother's<00:01:16.590> mother<00:01:16.830> she<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> nurse<00:01:18.060> during

World War two

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.850 
World War two
I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.649> one<00:01:19.830> reason<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.460> became<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.330> nurse<00:01:22.229> was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
I think one reason I became a nurse was

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.050 
I think one reason I became a nurse was
the<00:01:23.130> opportunity<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:25.069> witness<00:01:26.069> so<00:01:26.429> many<00:01:26.640> parts
