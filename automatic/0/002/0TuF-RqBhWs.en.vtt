two types of different ski techniques
the<00:02:51.650> first<00:02:51.890> side<00:02:52.129> is<00:02:52.280> going<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.459> be<00:02:52.580> with

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
the first side is going to be with

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.479 
the first side is going to be with
unweighting<00:02:53.420> up<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.010> pressure<00:02:55.250> my

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
unweighting up I'm going to pressure my

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.699 
unweighting up I'm going to pressure my
skis

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
skis

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.390 
skis
taking<00:02:57.159> my<00:02:57.280> body<00:02:57.519> up<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.540> set<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.959> turn

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
taking my body up in a set of the turn

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.500 
taking my body up in a set of the turn
then<00:03:00.400> I'm<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.700> switch<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.969> down<00:03:01.480> on

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
then I'm going to switch to down on

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.899 
then I'm going to switch to down on
waiting<00:03:02.079> I'm<00:03:02.799> going<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.069> flip<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.430> around<00:03:03.459> and

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
waiting I'm going to flip it around and

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.050 
waiting I'm going to flip it around and
I'm<00:03:04.750> gonna<00:03:04.900> squat<00:03:05.439> skis<00:03:05.859> out<00:03:06.060> increasing

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
I'm gonna squat skis out increasing

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.839 
I'm gonna squat skis out increasing
pressure<00:03:07.359> on<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.709> act<00:03:08.890> while<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:09.579> go<00:03:09.819> through

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
pressure on the act while I go through

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:41.710 
pressure on the act while I go through
the<00:03:10.120> turn

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.090
