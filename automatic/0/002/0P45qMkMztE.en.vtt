very<00:01:17.240> aggressive<00:01:19.990> see<00:01:20.990> what<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.170> mean<00:01:22.539> the

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
very aggressive see what I mean the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.350 
very aggressive see what I mean the
animal<00:01:23.780> itself<00:01:23.899> is<00:01:24.319> made<00:01:24.470> out<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:24.679> g10<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.550> if

animal itself is made out of g10 and if

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.080 
animal itself is made out of g10 and if
you<00:01:26.660> want<00:01:26.959> you<00:01:27.380> could<00:01:27.679> remove<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.550> screws<00:01:28.819> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
you want you could remove the screws and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.020

take<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.750> apart<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.380> think<00:01:31.190> I<00:01:31.429> haven't<00:01:31.700> tried<00:01:31.849> it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
take it apart I think I haven't tried it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.520 
take it apart I think I haven't tried it
so<00:01:32.420> can<00:01:33.140> be<00:01:33.170> sure<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:35.360> in<00:01:35.959> theory<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.289> could

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
so can be sure so in theory you could

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.350 
so can be sure so in theory you could
just<00:01:36.860> remove<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.399> put<00:01:37.459> something<00:01:38.119> else<00:01:38.209> if

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
just remove it and put something else if

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.940 
just remove it and put something else if
you<00:01:38.420> wanted<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.229> was<00:01:39.349> designed<00:01:39.649> as<00:01:39.920> a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950

fighting knife and now the center of
gravity<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.149> right<00:01:44.750> here<00:01:45.910> when<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.030> hold<00:01:47.240> it

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
playing with it for a while it's a bit

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.280 
playing with it for a while it's a bit
easier<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.490> can<00:03:19.700> open<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.000> with<00:03:20.240> one<00:03:20.570> hand
