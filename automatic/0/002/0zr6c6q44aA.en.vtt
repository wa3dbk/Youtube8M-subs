00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.799
 here today I want to introduce my program with Stina Mindmaps 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.050
 also stood in front of a corner hand 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.370
 yes you are allowed to come back again and again to you at school but also to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.480
 For example, if you always sing in presentation on the band I always sing 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.140
 Practically if you want to disqualify thoughts wg-life 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.149
 yes the program is called my user you can for free on my notebook 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.939
 and also come documentation 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.999
 and baths the program opens up the whole thing as it really does 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.060
 possibly Interfax 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.970
 I can not say that I was wrong, and I'll do it to you 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.990
 explain how it all works 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.980
 yes, here he has ten times the main point 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.410
 Tranter, I can just step in now 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600
 Appiano 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.230
 and then creature her remaining Klose can just add part yes 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.000
 and I cantz the field for example 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.920
 to Alphonse yes 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.490
 and then I think here now to start adding the name 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.150
 now all Hesse and just about everything you see to do with this topic 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.690
 has and farmer next to Jermaine all good point parents moved on 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.990
 Of course, I know you then also to insert new main part with 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 Isa always the same in the new color that it is very nice 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.659
 and if I'm not sure about the color of Som Fall, just click around 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.970
 Box in the trade 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.100
 and are we up here too 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.509
 and then we can just adjust the pallet actually everyone knows 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.050
 mac-user if you choose in addition to individually for the color of the LN 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:34.980
 want 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.539
 natural teeth sat with fonts 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.130
 On Licher Rizzi all selected works, of course, just one 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.980
 that 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.840
 and can parents here the prescribed percent fonts 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 just look 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.920
 enter 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.110
 and change to natural size and everything else 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.750
 that can be already in the big use of the functions 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.289
 Inman actually not synonymous with a mind map because 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.829
 this quite simple if now here, for example, have no nine main point 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.840
 just wanna announce it here and then add this plus 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.159
 Pledges to make two mindmaps in one 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.810
 yes, of course, now wanted your means Matt expression is synonymous quite 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.429
 Agree com and and grit moves 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.150
 and then you can take the parts here in the hand three times 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 and then he sees again Souter din-a4-side would look like 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.870
 So my pace is not always perfect for Obama, I have it now 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:33.229
 try something there has never been and against case 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.889
 which matched hearts because I always adjusted everything quite well 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.939
 Intensity sit astonishment select landscape and it will be automatic 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.849
 adapted as well that is about who fits perfectly on the place it fits 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.120
 Of course, she just has to press troops percent and then 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.340
 can you already print that and Gladbach Bailly easily 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.399
 as her bus normal cell phone share Quintin Schimek pull so dry 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.909
 Of course it can also be quite easy to save to Command up here 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.329
 Give fan name and then here at Ebensee and hedges had the shut off 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.309
 always open again and again 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.059
 and then then we wanted to change so we were all about one 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.159
 Text editor too 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.959
 yes, that does not mean anything for a long time, says Nord Geffert Ende ich 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:19.899
 pretty good 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.489
 I've been trying out some programs lately 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.719
 my march booster stones must be the Severt more which best it is 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.839
 very clear and kept on his Mac style 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:36.269
 yes that was it already takes if there is a description and a lot of information too 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.919
