hear<00:03:13.490> that<00:03:13.550> one<00:03:13.820> playing<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.150> game<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.440> frankly

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
hear that one playing a game and frankly

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.010 
hear that one playing a game and frankly
it's<00:03:15.470> distracting<00:03:16.460> unless<00:03:16.910> I'm<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.870> know

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
it's distracting unless I'm you know

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.980 
it's distracting unless I'm you know
being<00:03:18.380> cooperative<00:03:18.620> with<00:03:19.280> people<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.450> think

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
being cooperative with people so I think

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.590 
being cooperative with people so I think
there<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.130> hope<00:03:22.160> for<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.790> game<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.060> have

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
there is hope for this game to have

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.260 
there is hope for this game to have
voice<00:03:23.900> chat<00:03:24.230> with<00:03:24.740> friends<00:03:25.040> only<00:03:25.400> which<00:03:26.150> i

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
think is really the only good reason to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.230 
think is really the only good reason to
have<00:03:29.450> voice<00:03:29.750> chat<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:31.280> with<00:03:31.760> friends<00:03:32.090> only
