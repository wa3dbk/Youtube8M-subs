00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
exactly stylemaster is going to be

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.820 
exactly stylemaster is going to be
compared<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> mutt<00:01:09.689> 15<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.530> i'm<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
compared to mutt 15 but i'm going to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
compared to mutt 15 but i'm going to
guess<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.310> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> similar<00:01:11.820> pure

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
guess that it's kind of similar pure

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
guess that it's kind of similar pure
guest<00:01:12.900> purely<00:01:13.350> speculative<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.090> think

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
guest purely speculative but i do think

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
guest purely speculative but i do think
it's<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.780> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.229> similar<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> how

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's going to be kind of similar to how

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
it's going to be kind of similar to how
it<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.850> my<00:01:18.090> 15<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.600> least<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> would<00:01:18.930> be

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it was in my 15 at least that would be

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
it was in my 15 at least that would be
my<00:01:19.170> guess<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.759> next<00:01:21.030> card<00:01:21.210> you're<00:01:21.330> gonna

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
my guess now the next card you're gonna

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
my guess now the next card you're gonna
get<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:22.080> least<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.380> i'm<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> next

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
