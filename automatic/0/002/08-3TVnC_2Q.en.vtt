00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.760
 or line of expression and up to the day 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.350
 today we do not know how to do to 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.970
 eliminate it or mitigate the ones that I found 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 with the doctor vanesa angel of 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.180
 development already comes straight from the 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.350
 clinic train to be a doctor welcome 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.940
 thank you very much for being here with 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.559
 thank you for the invitation to be 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.240
 aware of imagine they show a 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.680
 little bit about this technique that we 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.840
 has brought first is also what 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.460
 I just said is to attenuate our 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.160
 line of expression to make them disappear 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 completely good let's start in the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.949
 center 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.259
 numerous alternative techniques to this 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 surgery because many people already 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.290
 be for repairs for possible 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 complications on side effects 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.059
 they do not want to enter the operating room 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 from europe numerous techniques between 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.610
 they the new film is what we are going to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.980
 apply now 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.990
 the polylactic acid and stuffs both the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.820
 deep wrinkles as superficial is 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.410
 the only market shade that serves 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.590
 for wrinkle wrinkle stays 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.390
 deep or shallow before 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.930
 proceed with the patient that we have 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.030
 here 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.020
 you want to talk 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.239
 Mr. Director then you can help us 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.400
 to imply the picture they do not exist 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.989
 numbers people where the 'new cold 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.850
 you can apply as many facials as 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.619
 bodily but one of the most 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.450
 suggested with the patients are the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.340
 nasolabial grooves that as we see here 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.130
 the effect is immediate that is very 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.469
 important 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.140
 then we have other areas as clean 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.930
 of cheeks of skin issues with 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.030
 alterations of the skin a third zone 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.700
 that are frown lines and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.200
 people over 45 and in the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.630
 very important young scars 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.340
 of acne that until now there was not a 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.409
 safe alternative to scar 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.690
 and this makes it disappear as we see 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.700
 here 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.800
 then also for lip augmentation 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.450
 alternative to the perfect biopolymers 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.680
 then we go straight to the treatment myself 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.750
 was explaining for what kind of 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.350
 people for what type of skin we started 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.110
 then we will place the patient 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 we as young patients 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.530
 over 30 years 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.789
 by the continuous exposure to the sun that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.950
 appears in this output are the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.640
 continuous expressions gestures we make 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 and that we can not avoid 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.619
 oppressive to speak that day by day we 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.179
 is also creating some type of ibi 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.550
 of course and nobody wants to have 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.350
 doubts everyone we all refuse to 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.180
 age even men 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.190
 have to say with 40 of our 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.800
 patients are men although they 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.450
 gives them a dispersal treatment then 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.980
 first point in favor anyone 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.350
 can this treatment be done call 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.200
 men or women if we start at home 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.970
 we clean the area 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.069
 We have usually done a previous design 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.709
 which it has now been withdrawn after him 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.720
 we put an anesthetic cream that 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.930
 we use annex also an alternative 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.689
 it would be a strand 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.099
 very powerful and avoids if the punctures and 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.600
 already from front we proceed to the application 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.610
 of the nasolabial fold 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.540
 is an application 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.540
 intradermal 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.739
 what is he injecting him for 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.959
 we are applying mine but this is 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.480
 base is polylactic acid is a 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.580
 synthetic substance therefore this is 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.860
 a greater advantage with respect to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.269
 collagen that is said in bovine not 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.430
 we have to do it in science choice 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.100
 prior and its greatest advantage with which 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.720
 Many patients ask for its duration 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.390
 since collagen can last you from 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.760
 six months to a year 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.950
 and to you for three to four years 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.599
 three waters 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.069
 three or four years if you do not have it 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.819
 to reapply the measures of the 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.079
 wrinkles you do not have to go into turns 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.090
 and as I've seen is an application 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.630
 completely painless, not traumatic 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.580
 machine 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.580
 we are erasing the line of expression 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.200
 in a method and procedure 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.760
 this patient does not even make one 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.450
 goodbye to relationship clothes 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.520
 immediate 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.410
 the event immediately now that we have 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.209
 stopped the little prick because it comes out 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.300
 a little blood we apply the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.410
 chromotherapy which are these instruments 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.410
 what we have here 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.890
 so we avoid getting inflamed since there 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.510
 many patients who come in their hours 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.900
 free and do not want your case the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.969
 few find out in this way 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.600
 we press the hub in that bosom of change 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:14.110
 it is evident and there is no inflammation 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.140
 does not comment it 's a kind of cold gel is 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.820
 a substance if it is a hydrojet 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.250
 frozen that we have ready keep 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.389
 1000 semi-solid liquids in this 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.639
 moment 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.590
 is acting on the lines of 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.950
 air pressure 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.500
 It serves for all of a sudden for dark circles 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.990
 as we have seen we not only use the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.940
 cold in nasolabial folds but also 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.190
 in the wrinkles of the forehead of 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.330
 frown and crow's feet is very 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.640
 important that can only be applied 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.850
 as an alternative to collagen in infield 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.230
 It lasts three times longer than collagen 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.230
 let's say because for 35 years 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.430
 to no age limit of course e 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.680
 even patients as I say very young 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.050
 of 25 years are coming by the continuous 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.860
 sun exposure they have had to the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.860
 Turtles begin to appear 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.900
 with respect to collagen is a little bit 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.880
 more expensive but its great benefit is that 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.620
 you do not have to reapply in 34 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.660
 years while the collagen every year 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.760
 you have to apply and so the 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.130
 Polylactic acid lasts 5 years and has 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.199
 two effects in a first phase that makes 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.910
 disappear the wrinkle proportional to 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.560
 volume that we are injecting and in a 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.870
 second phase stimulates the nheo with the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.660
 Genesis is to stimulate your collagen 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.370
 own skin and this collagen is the one that 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.110
 it lasts for so many years I do not know if they can 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.850
 make a close- up to the doctor to the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.370
 patient because it really is 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.169
 immediate is immediate the effect is seen and 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.000
 we have seen that there is no information and 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.860
 autogestiva more to withdraw a little while to 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.569
 who can see it on camera 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.139
 I do not know if they can make a close-up 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.139
 next to where 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.490
 I completely see that I am 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.590
 pretty close 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.750
 and I can tell you that it is completely 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.470
 the results are really effective 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.750
 yes 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.580
 by then it is clear that it is for 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.700
 all 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.860
 there is no age limit you can 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.450
 man if what we always say what 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.980
 we always say that one in a matter of 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.690
 our person in our skin 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.250
 we only have one share 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.170
 little bit good you have to invent that has 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.420
 inverted won because the face is 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.650
 the presentation of all things 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.190
 thank you very much for your mind 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.930
 today he consulted that he can call 24 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.729
 1883 2000 thank you doctor is really 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.729
 very physical we are going
