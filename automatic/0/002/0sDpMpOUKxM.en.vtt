here<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.900> all<00:02:16.319> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
here as you can see all the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.360 
here as you can see all the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
hyperpigmentation oh yeah which really

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.700 
hyperpigmentation oh yeah which really
didn't<00:02:20.819> get<00:02:20.969> that<00:02:21.239> bad<00:02:21.480> until<00:02:21.719> I<00:02:21.930> got<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.379> solve

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
didn't get that bad until I got to solve

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.870 
didn't get that bad until I got to solve
career<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:24.320> there's<00:02:25.320> my<00:02:25.530> beef<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:26.160> but

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you just do it and you work it into the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.910 
you just do it and you work it into the
