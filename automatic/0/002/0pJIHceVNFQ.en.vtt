you<00:01:34.640> would<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:34.939> seen<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.299> distinct<00:01:36.079> line<00:01:36.259> so

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
you would have seen a distinct line so

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.830 
you would have seen a distinct line so
by<00:01:36.799> dabbing<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.340> away<00:01:37.549> with<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.759> cloth<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.360> kind

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
by dabbing it away with a cloth it kind

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.590 
by dabbing it away with a cloth it kind
of<00:01:38.960> fades<00:01:39.469> or<00:01:39.770> blends<00:01:40.040> out<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.640> because<00:01:41.420> these

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
of fades or blends out and because these

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.139 
of fades or blends out and because these
inks<00:01:42.020> kind<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.350> blend<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.070> even<00:01:43.579> out<00:01:43.759> over

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
inks kind of blend and even out over

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.539 
inks kind of blend and even out over
time<00:01:44.390> as<00:01:44.659> they<00:01:44.810> dry<00:01:45.110> what<00:01:45.950> will<00:01:46.100> happen<00:01:46.430> is

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
time as they dry what will happen is

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.950 
time as they dry what will happen is
this<00:01:46.700> will<00:01:46.759> blend<00:01:47.180> into<00:01:47.360> each<00:01:47.479> other<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:47.780> get

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
this will blend into each other you get

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.940 
this will blend into each other you get
a<00:01:47.990> nice<00:01:48.439> nice<00:01:49.060> light<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.270> dark<00:01:50.509> look<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.710> again

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
a nice nice light to dark look but again

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.560 
a nice nice light to dark look but again
you<00:01:52.100> can<00:01:52.280> try<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:52.789> whatever<00:01:53.030> inks<00:01:53.479> you

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
you can try this with whatever inks you

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.999 
you can try this with whatever inks you
have<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.990> just<00:01:54.110> really<00:01:54.500> works<00:01:54.680> well<00:01:54.860> with<00:01:54.950> the

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
have it just really works well with the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.560 
pigment inks okay so now I have my
apples<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.130> look<00:02:01.310> at<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.579> shading<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.390> ones

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
apples and look at that shading the ones

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.999 
apples and look at that shading the ones
on<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.780> right<00:02:02.960> by<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.170> way<00:02:03.350> haven't<00:02:03.590> dried<00:02:03.799> as

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
on the right by the way haven't dried as

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.260 
on the right by the way haven't dried as
much<00:02:04.159> as<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.430> ones<00:02:04.579> on<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.759> left<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.119> can

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
much as the ones on the left so you can

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.990 
much as the ones on the left so you can
see<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.659> starts<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.200> blend<00:02:06.439> over<00:02:06.740> time<00:02:07.130> so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
see that starts to blend over time so

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.850 
see that starts to blend over time so
now<00:02:08.149> it's<00:02:08.300> time<00:02:08.539> for<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:09.229> cute<00:02:09.440> little<00:02:09.560> leaf

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
half of the leaf so that only the bottom

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.679 
half of the leaf so that only the bottom
half<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.189> leaf<00:02:40.340> has<00:02:40.579> that<00:02:40.879> darkness<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.569> it

half of the leaf has that darkness to it
it's<00:02:42.349> not<00:02:42.769> real<00:02:43.159> visible<00:02:43.549> here<00:02:44.120> on<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.959> camera

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
it's not real visible here on the camera

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.809 
it's not real visible here on the camera
but<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.739> does<00:02:46.010> make<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> difference<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.730> you

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
know when this all dries out for my stem

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.429 
know when this all dries out for my stem
I'm<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:50.030> drawing<00:02:50.389> it<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.900> with<00:02:51.079> a<00:02:51.109> Copic

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
I'm just drawing it in with a Copic

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.319 
I'm just drawing it in with a Copic
marker<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.889> can<00:02:52.040> use<00:02:52.159> any<00:02:52.430> kind<00:02:52.669> of<00:02:52.790> marker<00:02:53.120> or

brush<00:02:53.540> or<00:02:53.750> pencil<00:02:53.780> here<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:55.220> find<00:02:55.370> that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
brush or pencil here I just find that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.860 
brush or pencil here I just find that
kopecks<00:02:55.790> are<00:02:55.909> pretty<00:02:56.090> quick<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.480> easy<00:02:56.659> to<00:02:56.840> use

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
kopecks are pretty quick and easy to use

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.050 
kopecks are pretty quick and easy to use
and<00:02:57.439> I<00:02:57.500> add<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> little<00:02:57.889> shadowing<00:02:58.819> on<00:02:58.939> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
and I add a little shadowing on the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.300 
and I add a little shadowing on the
bottom<00:02:59.389> or<00:02:59.840> shading<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.439> bottom<00:03:00.709> with<00:03:01.099> a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
bottom or shading on the bottom with a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.940 
bottom or shading on the bottom with a
darker<00:03:01.760> color<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:02.299> Copic<00:03:02.750> okay<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:03.439> now<00:03:03.769> it's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
darker color of Copic okay so now it's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.470 
darker color of Copic okay so now it's
time<00:03:04.159> to<00:03:04.189> do<00:03:04.370> those<00:03:04.519> squiggles<00:03:04.939> on<00:03:05.120> top<00:03:05.329> of

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
time to do those squiggles on top of

but I thought something interesting like
a<00:03:45.709> diagonal<00:03:46.099> piece<00:03:46.459> would<00:03:46.609> be<00:03:46.669> fun<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.150> have

go wrong with a stripe background and I
like<00:05:05.210> this<00:05:05.419> stamp<00:05:05.720> because<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.139> can<00:05:06.259> stamp<00:05:06.470> it

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
like this stamp because you can stamp it

on the craft piece which has a foam
piece<00:06:03.949> underneath<00:06:04.279> it<00:06:04.729> already<00:06:04.969> so<00:06:05.750> I<00:06:05.779> need

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
piece underneath it already so I need

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.320 
piece underneath it already so I need
two<00:06:06.319> pieces<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.860> be<00:06:06.949> even<00:06:07.310> on<00:06:07.460> my<00:06:07.759> leaf<00:06:07.940> I<00:06:08.150> don't

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
two pieces to be even on my leaf I don't

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.309 
two pieces to be even on my leaf I don't
know<00:06:08.389> I<00:06:08.419> think<00:06:08.509> about<00:06:08.750> these<00:06:09.020> kind<00:06:09.229> of<00:06:09.259> things

know I think about these kind of things
so<00:06:09.500> I<00:06:09.529> put<00:06:09.740> my<00:06:09.830> cards<00:06:10.099> together<00:06:10.370> so<00:06:10.520> that<00:06:10.669> the

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
so I put my cards together so that the

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.999 
so I put my cards together so that the
Apple<00:06:11.389> lays<00:06:11.630> nice<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:11.990> flat<00:06:12.199> but<00:06:12.560> lifted<00:06:12.889> off

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
Apple lays nice and flat but lifted off

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.399 
Apple lays nice and flat but lifted off
the<00:06:13.190> card<00:06:13.430> so<00:06:14.419> now<00:06:14.539> it's<00:06:14.840> time<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.110> add<00:06:15.380> some

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
finishing touches on the card look it by

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.029 
finishing touches on the card look it by
the<00:06:17.509> way<00:06:17.630> check<00:06:17.900> out<00:06:18.050> how<00:06:18.259> that<00:06:18.289> background

the way check out how that background
matches<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.669> craft<00:06:19.940> pretty<00:06:20.240> well<00:06:20.409> now<00:06:21.409> the

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
matches the craft pretty well now the

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.469 
matches the craft pretty well now the

I'm just scribbling this over all of my
apples<00:06:29.960> so<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.139> has<00:06:30.289> a<00:06:30.319> little<00:06:30.500> bit<00:06:30.590> of<00:06:30.650> shimmer

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
apples so it has a little bit of shimmer

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.469 
apples so it has a little bit of shimmer
really<00:06:31.550> makes<00:06:31.729> a<00:06:31.819> big<00:06:32.000> difference<00:06:32.360> on<00:06:32.419> a

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
really makes a big difference on a

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.149 
really makes a big difference on a
simple<00:06:32.900> card<00:06:33.110> like<00:06:33.289> this<00:06:33.440> one<00:06:33.500> hard<00:06:34.039> to

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
simple card like this one hard to

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.800 
simple card like this one hard to
capture<00:06:34.340> in<00:06:34.639> the<00:06:34.729> video<00:06:34.969> but<00:06:35.149> it<00:06:35.300> really<00:06:35.570> is

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
capture in the video but it really is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.260 
capture in the video but it really is
great<00:06:36.080> in<00:06:36.229> real<00:06:36.380> life<00:06:36.529> then<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:37.639> die<00:06:37.699> cut<00:06:38.120> a

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
great in real life then I die cut a

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.250 
great in real life then I die cut a
bunch<00:06:38.479> of<00:06:38.630> tiny<00:06:38.930> little<00:06:39.259> hearts

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
bunch of tiny little hearts

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.990

and<00:06:40.350> I<00:06:40.590> am<00:06:40.770> dipping<00:06:41.190> them<00:06:41.340> into<00:06:41.520> some<00:06:41.820> glossy

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
and I am dipping them into some glossy

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.810 
and I am dipping them into some glossy
accents<00:06:42.750> and<00:06:42.930> adding<00:06:43.620> them<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.040> little

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
accents and adding them to the little

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.950 
accents and adding them to the little
apple<00:06:45.150> here<00:06:45.330> I<00:06:45.360> think<00:06:45.570> it<00:06:45.660> makes<00:06:45.810> a<00:06:45.930> big

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960

apple here I think it makes a big
difference<00:06:46.410> I<00:06:46.620> can't<00:06:47.070> decide<00:06:47.340> where<00:06:47.490> to<00:06:47.520> put

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
it finally picked a place these tweezers

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.260 
it finally picked a place these tweezers
that<00:06:49.740> kind<00:06:50.130> of<00:06:50.190> grab<00:06:50.430> a<00:06:50.460> hold<00:06:50.820> of<00:06:50.970> the<00:06:51.090> little

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270
