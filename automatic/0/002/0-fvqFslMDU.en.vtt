this video has been requested from time

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.850 
this video has been requested from time
to<00:00:18.180> time<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.630> past<00:00:18.750> year<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.620> thought

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
to time in the past year so so I thought

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.760 
to time in the past year so so I thought
it<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.070> high<00:00:20.250> time<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.880> get<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.960> done<00:00:22.170> so

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
it was high time that I get it done so

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.620 
it was high time that I get it done so
it<00:00:23.280> actually<00:00:23.490> comes<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.120> perfect<00:00:24.450> timing

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it actually comes it's perfect timing

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.300 
it actually comes it's perfect timing
cuz<00:00:24.900> i<00:00:24.930> recently<00:00:25.200> got<00:00:25.350> new<00:00:25.680> storage<00:00:25.950> from<00:00:26.160> my

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
cuz i recently got new storage from my

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.430 
cuz i recently got new storage from my
polishes<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:27.420> longest<00:00:27.810> time<00:00:27.870> i<00:00:28.020> was<00:00:28.230> keeping

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
polishes the longest time i was keeping

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.010 
polishes the longest time i was keeping
them<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.920> big<00:00:29.100> basket<00:00:29.700> and<00:00:29.960> they<00:00:30.960> were

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
them in this big basket and they were

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.600 
them in this big basket and they were
just<00:00:31.200> piled<00:00:31.530> on<00:00:31.740> top<00:00:31.770> of<00:00:31.950> each<00:00:32.130> other<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
just piled on top of each other it was a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.280 
just piled on top of each other it was a
huge<00:00:32.940> mess<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> became<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> different

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
huge mess it became like the different

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
huge mess it became like the different
layers<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.800> Amazon<00:00:35.190> rainforest<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.120> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
layers of the Amazon rainforest so I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.850 
layers of the Amazon rainforest so I
actually<00:00:36.510> found<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.320> mini<00:00:37.530> milk

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
actually found these little mini milk

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.270 
actually found these little mini milk
crates<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.989> office<00:00:39.989> depot<00:00:40.019> and<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.249> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
crates at office depot and I have a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
crates at office depot and I have a
couple<00:00:41.519> other<00:00:41.760> colors<00:00:42.539> as<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:42.749> but<00:00:43.109> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
couple other colors as well but the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
couple other colors as well but the
reason<00:00:43.589> I<00:00:43.769> really<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.640> because

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
reason I really like these is because

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.939 
reason I really like these is because
they<00:00:45.059> actually<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.589> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> can

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
they actually I don't know if you can

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.040 
they actually I don't know if you can
see<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.249> little<00:00:47.370> circles<00:00:47.699> on<00:00:48.329> either<00:00:48.629> side

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
see these little circles on either side

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
see these little circles on either side
right<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.399> connect<00:00:51.300> them

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
right here but you can connect them

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
right here but you can connect them
together<00:00:51.659> like<00:00:52.319> that<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.069> makes<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
together like that and then it makes a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.649 
together like that and then it makes a
little<00:00:53.460> tray<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.819> can<00:00:53.969> even<00:00:54.120> carry<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.600> around

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
little tray you can even carry it around

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.110 
little tray you can even carry it around
by<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.949> middle<00:00:56.249> if<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.760> pick<00:00:56.909> it<00:00:57.030> up

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
by the the middle if I would pick it up

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
by the the middle if I would pick it up
by<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.269> outsides<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.589> snap

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
by the outsides these two just snap

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040 
by the outsides these two just snap
apart<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.789> away<00:00:59.819> so<00:01:00.089> I<00:01:00.359> should<00:01:00.569> be<00:01:00.629> careful

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
apart right away so I should be careful

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.040 
apart right away so I should be careful
about<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.769> then<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.789> creates<00:01:03.059> almost<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
about that and then it creates almost a

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.990 
about that and then it creates almost a
little<00:01:04.170> nail<00:01:04.530> polish<00:01:04.979> condominium<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
little nail polish condominium if you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
little nail polish condominium if you
will<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.440> because<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
will but I really like this because I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
will but I really like this because I
can<00:01:08.190> always<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:09.659> separate<00:01:10.020> them<00:01:10.170> by<00:01:10.320> colors

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
can always I can separate them by colors

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.840 
can always I can separate them by colors
which<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
which I really like I don't have to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.639 
which I really like I don't have to
carry<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.149> whole<00:01:12.420> shebang<00:01:13.049> around<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.530> me
