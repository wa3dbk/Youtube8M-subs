00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.080
 at 30 o'clock with feintool basketball 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 momentum 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.439
 Do you really have a favorite model? 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.320
 but air france already such a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.340
 My darling as the first one was exactly 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 on here is your favorite brand 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.110
 not really a jeremy scott or not 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.700
 a little bit worse 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.150
 sometimes jeremy scott than me 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.040
 I think 2009 because I think so 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.210
 buy my shoe then was the money 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.490
 not k dennis 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.290
 it does not exist anymore but so far 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.700
 is still waiting for a cool new 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.150
 the'd like that then I would 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.400
 then also women with sneakers wear well 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.080
 or not it depends if you 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.750
 in any case but currently have 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.140
 I think they are still a bit 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.550
 groping in the dark should therefore would 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 I'm happy if that maybe still 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.630
 a little bit more of the women too 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.310
 interest would come then already on 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.310
 simplicity top sneaker or local 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.990
 the shoes come in the showcase or 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.160
 I trite she has flexi from that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.010
 We have the next pair of cleaned shoes 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.520
 week, I'll take it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.020
 I can only get damp toilet paper 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.510
 recommend and then clean a bit 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.950
 with a swam on and then 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.620

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.060

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.450
 I think he's comfortable so I can only 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 recommend 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.900
 spare 1 1 how would a shoe 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.900
 look because you design I should 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.780
 would the airforce one of course on 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.780
 best avoided 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.820
 his surface and that would be me then 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.690
