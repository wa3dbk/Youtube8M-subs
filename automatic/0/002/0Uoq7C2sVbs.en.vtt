00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 magneto is one of the strongest heroes 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.640
 comic he owns electromagnetism 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.370
 one of the four fundamental 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.830
 interactions in the universe with a wave of the hand 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.900
 he can destroy an entire army break 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
 power tools by thought and even 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 damage someone's nervous system but 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.500
 an ordinary person could never 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 do something like this is all just in 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.119
 comic or not you don't need to be 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.220
 mutants to manipulate 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 electromagnetism human society 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 learned to control him from when 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 michael faraday created the first 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.460
 electric motor in 1821 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.950
 electromagnet control has changed our 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.050
 the world is so much so that people living 200 years 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 back could not even imagine him 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 we use it not only to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.170
 supply our cities with electricity 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.969
 their storage device mobile 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.160
 phones electric locks and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.899
 columns but this is what humanity 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.090
 may have achieved in its amount 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 using developed infrastructure and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 advanced mechanism i wonder 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.350
 know if a simple person like you can 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 or get me the abilities of a magnet 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.450
 using a device that everyone could 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760
 carry around accident related funny 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 the world show how strong u are 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.869
 can be created by man 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.659
 electromagnetic fields number and sucked 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.580
 chairs and whole hospital beds sometimes 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 they were dragged down by such force that they 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.400
 killed people who happened to be in their 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.860
 to find 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.619
 his mart magnet is so strong because 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.540
 super conductors use this ordinary 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.520
 electro could easily be made simple 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 wind wire good conductivity of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.450
 for example brass around taro pieces 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.049
 when an electric current passes through 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.270
 wire 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.579
 it magnetizes the metal the stronger 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.290
 the more magnetized metal 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.970
 but there is one problem magnitude 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 voltage limited 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.230
 resistance to understand what to give 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.150
 definition you need to know what 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.850
 electric current is a stream of electrons 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.010
 these electrons move through conductive 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.440
 material like copper wire for example 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.960
 resistance occurs when electrons 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.210
 collide garden and moving inside 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.550
 wiring superconductor same done so 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 that the atoms in it stop moving this 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.530
 removes all resistance and current strength 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.690
 completely lost it allows us 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.090
 create strong electromagnetic fields 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.980
 the only problem is super conductive 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.110
 materials in that they work 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 only at very low temperatures and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.430
 when i say low temperature not 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.740
 mean your home I want 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.260
 say that the temperature should be lower 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.450
 30 kelvin to achieve so much 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.850
 low temperature need huge 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 amount of energy and a bunch of special 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.459
 equipment 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 this is exactly what a strong electromagnet does 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.700
 and inaccessible for use in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.510
 Everyday life 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.040
 but scientists do not sit still in 1986 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.170
 a group of wrestling scientists 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.730
 developed ceramics which can 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.489
 get super carried on 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.610
 temperatures above 30 kelvins for this 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.709
 discovery they received the Nobel Prize 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.630
 Now we already have two more 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.840
 can become super conductive when 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.000
 temperatures above 138 kelvins main 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.890
 the purpose of these researched creating super 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.120
 conductors capable of working when 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.610
 room temperature 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.290
 of these media theorists how do you think that 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.690
 we will be such materials 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.970
 before the end of the old and the device of all 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.280
 use very much to change the world 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.570
 removal of electromagnetic shit phenomena 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.709
 drastically reduce the cost 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.630
 electricity 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.760
 as well as reduce pollution 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.230
 the environment will also happen 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.390
 transportation revolution 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
 letting the machines on a magnetic cushion 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.130
 use only a small part of that 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.410
 the energy that the machines use now 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.610
 speaking of ordinary people superconductor and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.799
 will give you the opportunity 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.060
 has the strongest electromagnets and so 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.220
 as you do not need auxiliary 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.670
 cooling devices 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.590
 they 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.209
 will also be very small and even 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.890
 so small they can 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.110
 fit in your palm 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.910
 in this way, like a magnet, you can 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.430
 attract or repel any 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.830
 items are made of metals despite 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.630
 that you will have some limitations with 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.819
 which magnet did not come across in 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.680
 comics so you'll be limited your 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.020
 strength and weight you will have the opportunity 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 work on objects at a distance 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.340
 but the car to itself will not work 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.650
 because your magnetic field is faster 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.599
 there is no item you car than a car to you 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.190
 because of the seemingly magnet on your shoes you 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.169
 can fly above metal 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.850
 plate but not above the ground like this 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.340
 makes magnets but you can also 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.710
 do what the magnet can't do 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.990
 you can push away a person who does not have 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.120
 innocent metal things on themselves so 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.979
 and scientists turned out using strong 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.350
 magnetic fields force a toad 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.210
 Levitate The fact is that the water is inside 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.520
 toads gia magnet and it can 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.740
 affect the electromagnetic field then 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.810
 the same can work with a person 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.330
 if you shoot we have enough 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.930
 a strong field of water in the body and drags him 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.910
 backwards 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.280
 as you can imagine it was 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.970
 would be very unpleasant or even dangerous for 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.220
 health 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.169
 but the problem here is that the creation 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.330
 such a strong electromagnetic field 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.860
 it would be dangerous for you too 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.960
 would have to create a special 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.419
 tank around your magnet to 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.000
 protect yourself from the electromagnetic field 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.620
 as well as concentrate it and direct 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.120
 in the right direction but to 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.729
 use all amazing 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.390
 opportunities provided by 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.789
 electromagnetism we donâ€™t have to 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.800
 create the strongest glades so us 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.410
 don't even need to become super appearance 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.690
 conductors orico scientists cheers 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.180
 the site has already created quite powerful 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.280
 electromagnetic weapons that are capable 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.410
 disable moving car also 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.750
 they promise to create a small model for 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.940
 manual use the next five years 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.039
 as I said in the last issue 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.020
 will become friction electromagnetic fields 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.450
 can have a huge amount of effects 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.130
 on the human brain they can do 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.050
 human indifference cause 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.090
 hallucinations pick in person 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.280
 the ability to speak and even change 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.289
 someone's moral compass for all this 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.449
 and need strength 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.419
 electromagnetic fields are only needed 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.159
 well aimed at absolutely ready 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.319
 get all the incredible powers 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.599
 provided by electromagnetism a 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.189
 also eagle i'm pretty sure i'll 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.349
 use them only for the benefit 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:02.449
 humanity on the game in the end 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.860
 seize the world don't worry i don't exactly 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.050
 I will act like a goat 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.539
