00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
oil now I'm using vegetable oil but you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.149 
oil now I'm using vegetable oil but you
could<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> course<00:01:11.400> use<00:01:12.320> any<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
could of course use any other kind of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
could of course use any other kind of
oil<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.549> prefer<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.450> also<00:01:15.630> replace<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
oil you prefer you can also replace this

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
oil you prefer you can also replace this
with<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.680> same<00:01:16.890> amount<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.520> melted<00:01:18.060> butter

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
with the same amount of melted butter

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.530 
with the same amount of melted butter
but<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.689> find<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.939> vegetable<00:01:20.939> oil<00:01:21.090> tends

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
but I find that the vegetable oil tends

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
but I find that the vegetable oil tends
to<00:01:21.689> keep<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> cake<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.560> more<00:01:22.770> stuff<00:01:23.070> and
