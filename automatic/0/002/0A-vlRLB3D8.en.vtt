 who have been following me for a long time 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.500
 They will know that this clone already had thought 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.320
 bring it is a device with android 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.350
 4.2 that has an interface interface 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.239
 identical to them then 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.079
 if it's very similar the cell phone is this 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.969
 perfectly made to measure 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.129
 iphone5 original and good I sell it to 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.469
 end of May I will be receiving 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.960
 these products for sale this is not to 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.049
 the sale is only to be seen 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.320
 down here is the link of my page 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.699
 facebook where you can contact me for 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.830

 reports is also the galaxy s3 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.330
 how good this is clone 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.340
 but if you are interested they already know how 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.010
 on my facebook page you sing me so much 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.220
 but good we go in an iphone boxing 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.490
 5 and after we will see more in detail 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.140
 its hardware characteristics and 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 performance in your full meeting but 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.759
 just the boxing hom 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.360
 As you can see, the first thing is the iphone 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.360
 most valuable 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.490
 which has a very black color 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.490
 very good very bright finish 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.130
 here on the right we can find what 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.240
 which is the micro sim to put the chip 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.509
 up is the power button 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.750
 on the left we find the button 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.140
 from 'me it 's a switch rather 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.020
 and the volumes down here something very 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.200
 interesting is that it's the line connector 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.480
 the new connector that you use in your 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.620
 new devices as is the ipad 4 and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.860
 iphone 5 is the auxiliary output the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.470
 microphone and the horn then we're going to 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.590
 see your accessories right now I'm going to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.980
 proceed to turn on the phone but 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.730
 well this is something that no longer deals 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 much of the sound to open the micro sim 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.000
 manuals 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.770
 here are the hearing aids that are 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.800
 the troublemakers who use there is the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.500
 microphone and all hands free 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.480
 is the charger rather the adapter 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.599
 to charge 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.020
 just like the steam also and what 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.530
 I was saying 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.530
 and this one 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.510
 it's the line line connector 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.780
 which is very comfortable because good here 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.939
 can see you have end you have both a 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.709
 side as the other 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.379
 this gives us more comfort at the time 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.470
 of connecting it because it can be so much 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.380
 this side 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.520
 is connected as if I want it 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.960
 also connects and enters as if nothing 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.560
 then it is very comfortable that I see 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.780
 of positive to this device so 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.110
 now I understand, let's see how 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.210
 start 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.500
 is the apple logo 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.750
 I'm going to put this aside 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.180
 and well, I told them that it is very 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.069
 thin 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.439
 there is where says iphone 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.530
 with its two glass finishes here 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.540
 up and this is aluminum I do not know 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.659
 if with the sound they distinguish that after 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.210
 if it is aluminum a very material 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.240
 resistant 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.090
 and start teams then let's see 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.980
 its interface something so that they see more or 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.220
 less an idea of the phone 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.379
 and well, here we are going to see 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.290
 more thoroughly in the review but here something 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.579
 basic is that good the original has 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.919
 also this little button 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.050
 what is it to configure applications 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:29.900
 fast as is the vibration shine wifi 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.460
 things like this this also has it then 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.569
 is something more similar that has also 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.669
 in the review let's run slow you 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.460
 just to see that if it's a clone 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.009
 here is the plays thor comes as up 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.589
 store in the in the application drawer 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.039
 but you can see that it's the bull plays in 

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:49.039
 reality 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.680
 and the home button does not really work 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.310
 as a man who brings us back to 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.930
 applications works more like the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.030
 then return button from android 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.120
 to go straight to the as per 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.120
 example not let's go to the thorax laws 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.590
 or some other application is not 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.590
 What could I do 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.240
 configuration after more 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.950
 and well they will see that I pressed the 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.200
 home button and it will not go to the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.410
 applications only returns 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.450
 then to go home what you have to 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.930
 to do is that the iter who in the box 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.880
 and then home and now if you go back 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.850
 already gave them the rooted phone and 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.740
 ready to integrate for free then no 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.740
 be concerned about that 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.990
 they see that it is a practically an iphone 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.630
 in terms of its interface 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.360
 here in general we can see everything about 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.969
 of the telephone 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.849
 they have 24 points but to do it more 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:07.800
 original here they said it was 6.0 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.800
 and that is the 32gb version 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.020
 is unlocked for any 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:18.120
 company and then they could give a 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.120
 idea of ​​what this phone is 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:24.870
 same here in calls is all the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.790
 identical 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.790
 and you can move where you want 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:38.220
 even the mail is also 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.490
 and identical to the original iphone5 all 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.900
 is actually very similar and 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.100
 obviously if we enter an application 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.500
 or something like that if you change for example here 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.320
 the facebook then no but we some other 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.350
 application if it changes 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.900
 so, I hope you liked it 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.670

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.130

 and well if this later I will upload the 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.050
 full review of this device for

 to see it more thoroughly and convince 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.880
 that it 's a great phone so it would be
