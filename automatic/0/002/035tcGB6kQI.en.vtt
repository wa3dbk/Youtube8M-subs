hey guys what I want to talk about today

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.240 
hey guys what I want to talk about today
is<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.149> common<00:00:04.049> type<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.259> sprinkler<00:00:04.770> problem

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
is a common type of sprinkler problem

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.010 
is a common type of sprinkler problem
sprinkler<00:00:05.700> malfunction<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.390> happens<00:00:06.870> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
sprinkler malfunction that happens to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.750 
sprinkler malfunction that happens to
just<00:00:07.170> about<00:00:07.440> every<00:00:07.770> sprinkler<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.639> you're

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
just about every sprinkler that you're

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820 
just about every sprinkler that you're
going<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:08.970> run<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.450> any<00:00:09.540> any<00:00:10.290> length<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.769> time

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
going to run for any any length of time

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.190 
going to run for any any length of time
and<00:00:10.980> that's<00:00:11.340> clogging<00:00:11.840> clogging<00:00:12.840> happens

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and that's clogging clogging happens

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.600 
and that's clogging clogging happens
just<00:00:13.349> because<00:00:13.469> there's<00:00:13.769> bits<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> dirt<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
just because there's bits of dirt and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.060 
just because there's bits of dirt and
debris<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.660> system<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.080> get<00:00:16.529> lodged<00:00:16.770> in

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
debris in the system that get lodged in

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.500 
debris in the system that get lodged in
the<00:00:17.190> head<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> sprinkler<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.180> make<00:00:18.330> them

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the head of the sprinkler and make them

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.240 
the head of the sprinkler and make them
so<00:00:18.690> they're<00:00:18.840> not<00:00:18.960> very<00:00:19.020> functional<00:00:19.800> anymore

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
so they're not very functional anymore

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.480 
so they're not very functional anymore
and<00:00:21.090> you'll<00:00:21.720> notice<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.769> your<00:00:22.949> lawn<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and you'll notice in in your lawn if you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
and you'll notice in in your lawn if you
have<00:00:23.640> clogging<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.480> sprinkler<00:00:24.960> will

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
have clogging that your sprinkler will

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.439 
have clogging that your sprinkler will
just<00:00:25.560> start<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.920> dribble<00:00:26.130> water<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.789> won't

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
just start to dribble water and won't

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
just start to dribble water and won't
won't<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.260> pop<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.099> spray<00:00:29.369> anymore

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
won't actually pop up and spray anymore

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
won't actually pop up and spray anymore
or<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> does<00:00:30.480> pop<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.380> spray<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.769> going

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
or if it does pop up the spray is going

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
or if it does pop up the spray is going
to<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:32.279> limited<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> come

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
to be very limited just going to come

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.420 
to be very limited just going to come
out<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.050> weakly<00:00:34.469> or<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
out very weakly or it's just going to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090 
out very weakly or it's just going to
pop<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.180> certain<00:00:36.649> distance<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.739> it'll

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
pop up a certain distance but it'll

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.470 
pop up a certain distance but it'll
dribble<00:00:38.460> water<00:00:38.610> after<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.360> won't

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
dribble water after that it won't

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
dribble water after that it won't
actually<00:00:39.719> spray<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.890> don't<00:00:41.579> worry<00:00:41.760> your

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
actually spray so don't worry your

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
actually spray so don't worry your
sprinkler<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> most<00:00:42.629> likely<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.200> broken<00:00:43.530> you

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
sprinkler is most likely not broken you

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
sprinkler is most likely not broken you
most<00:00:44.040> likely<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.000> replace<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
most likely don't have to replace the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
most likely don't have to replace the
whole<00:00:46.320> sprinkler<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.700> most<00:00:47.940> likely<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
whole sprinkler it's most likely just

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
whole sprinkler it's most likely just
that<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.020> filter<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.590> clogged<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.039> most

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that your filter is clogged and most

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
that your filter is clogged and most
sprinklers<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.690> filters

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
sprinklers are going to have filters

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
sprinklers are going to have filters
that<00:00:52.410> you're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.250> identify

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that you're going to have to identify

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
that you're going to have to identify
and<00:00:54.059> locate<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:55.020> order<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and locate in order to take them out of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
and locate in order to take them out of
the<00:00:56.370> sprinkler<00:00:56.760> head<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.180> clean<00:00:57.390> them<00:00:57.570> and

the sprinkler head and clean them and
put<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:57.989> back<00:00:58.050> I'm<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.280> as

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
put them back I'm going to use this as

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.900 
put them back I'm going to use this as
my<00:01:00.480> example<00:01:00.780> which<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.829> all<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> videos

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
my example which I use in all the videos

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.990 
my example which I use in all the videos
a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.180> two-inch<00:01:03.719> pop-up<00:01:04.229> orbit<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.850> show

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
a little two-inch pop-up orbit to show

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.570 
a little two-inch pop-up orbit to show
you<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> locate<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> filter<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.070> take

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you how to locate a filter on and take

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.250 
you how to locate a filter on and take
it<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.850> remove<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.479> clean<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:09.960> put<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
it out remove it clean it and put it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.640 
it out remove it clean it and put it
back

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
back

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
back
now<00:01:10.920> most<00:01:11.189> sprinklers<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
now most sprinklers are going to have a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.020 
now most sprinklers are going to have a
solider<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> some<00:01:13.140> type<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:14.100> might<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.850> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
solider of some type they might not be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.700 
solider of some type they might not be
in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> exact<00:01:15.570> same<00:01:15.780> place<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.350> might<00:01:16.560> not

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
in the exact same place they might not

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.140 
in the exact same place they might not
come<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> exact<00:01:17.580> same<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.030> but

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
come out in the exact same way but

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
come out in the exact same way but
generally<00:01:18.450> there's<00:01:19.049> two<00:01:19.290> ways<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> can

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
generally there's two ways that you can

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.780 
generally there's two ways that you can
take<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> filter<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.530> sprinkler<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.520> as

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
take a filter out of a sprinkler one as

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.080 
take a filter out of a sprinkler one as
in<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.780> case<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:26.009> pop<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in this case is to pop up you have to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960 
in this case is to pop up you have to
actually<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> pop<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.549> sprinkler

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
actually go and pop up the sprinkler

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually go and pop up the sprinkler
head<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> hold<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.369> doesn't

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
head like this and hold it so it doesn't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.080 
head like this and hold it so it doesn't
pop<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.509> down<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> unscrew

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
pop back down and you have to unscrew

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
pop back down and you have to unscrew
the<00:01:37.430> brass<00:01:38.430> tip<00:01:39.439> like<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.750> then<00:01:42.750> your

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110

then you're going to want to what I
recommend<00:02:13.150> doing<00:02:14.909> because<00:02:15.909> if<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.260> take<00:02:17.500> this

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
recommend doing because if you take this

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.580 
recommend doing because if you take this
part<00:02:18.040> off<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.970> just<00:02:19.000> let<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.540> pop<00:02:20.170> back

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
part off and you just let it pop back

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.649 
part off and you just let it pop back
down<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.670> can't<00:02:21.909> get<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.150> back<00:02:22.269> out<00:02:22.510> again

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
down you can't get it back out again

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.589 
down you can't get it back out again
like<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:23.470> its<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:24.730> down<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.239> there<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
like that's its it now down in there and

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.619 
like that's its it now down in there and
you<00:02:26.470> can't<00:02:26.739> get<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.579> can't<00:02:28.269> get<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
you can't get it you can't get it to

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.750 
you can't get it you can't get it to
come<00:02:28.780> back<00:02:28.840> out<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.440> sometimes<00:02:29.920> what<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.549> can

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
come back out so sometimes what you can

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.149 
come back out so sometimes what you can
do<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.810> take<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.560> filter<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
do if you take out the filter and the

do if you take out the filter and the
tit<00:02:33.400> if<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:34.060> get<00:02:34.239> lucky<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.079> come<00:02:35.319> now

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
tit if you get lucky you can come now

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.470 
tit if you get lucky you can come now
that<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.159> is<00:02:36.340> pop<00:02:36.579> back<00:02:36.819> down<00:02:37.090> into<00:02:37.390> the

ground you can come you can put the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
filter down in there and push it seated

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.589 
filter down in there and push it seated
all<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> way<00:02:42.519> down<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.239> can<00:02:43.390> put

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
all the way down and then you can put

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.509 
all the way down and then you can put
your<00:02:43.629> your<00:02:44.379> tip<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.799> there<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.099> if<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.310> get

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
your your tip in there and if you get

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.069 
your your tip in there and if you get
lucky<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.060> might<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.629> able<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> catch<00:02:47.049> some

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
lucky you might be able to catch some

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.199 
lucky you might be able to catch some
threads<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:47.799> not<00:02:47.980> usually<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.910> what<00:02:49.060> you'll

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
threads but not usually so what you'll

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.460 
threads but not usually so what you'll
ultimately<00:02:49.440> probably<00:02:50.440> have<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.829> do<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:52.470> take

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
ultimately probably have to do is take

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.800 
ultimately probably have to do is take
off<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.859> entire<00:02:54.069> head<00:02:54.609> otherwise<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.599> can't

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
off this entire head otherwise you can't

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.360 
off this entire head otherwise you can't
really<00:02:56.079> unless<00:02:56.500> you're<00:02:56.709> going<00:02:56.829> to<00:02:56.890> use<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.069> pair

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
really unless you're going to use a pair

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.009 
really unless you're going to use a pair
of<00:02:57.400> vise<00:02:57.640> grips<00:02:57.670> or<00:02:58.120> something<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.629> hold<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
of vise grips or something to hold the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.559 
of vise grips or something to hold the
top<00:02:59.319> up<00:02:59.560> while<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.370> go<00:03:00.549> inside<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.209> clean<00:03:01.420> it

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
top up while you go inside and clean it

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.380 
top up while you go inside and clean it
off<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:02.260> you're<00:03:02.470> going<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:03.120> probably<00:03:04.120> have

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
off then you're going to probably have

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.000 
off then you're going to probably have
to<00:03:04.569> take<00:03:04.750> off<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:05.140> entire<00:03:05.560> head<00:03:05.799> and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
to take off this entire head and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.559 
to take off this entire head and
sometimes<00:03:06.730> you're<00:03:06.909> going<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.390> take

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
sometimes you're going to have to take

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.360 
sometimes you're going to have to take
off<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.959> head<00:03:08.200> anyway<00:03:08.560> because<00:03:08.739> that's<00:03:09.040> just

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
off this head anyway because that's just

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.309 
off this head anyway because that's just
how<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.579> sprinkler<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.180> going<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.930> set<00:03:11.200> up

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
how the sprinkler is going to be set up

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.229 
how the sprinkler is going to be set up
so<00:03:11.349> that<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.829> filter<00:03:12.040> won't<00:03:12.669> come<00:03:12.940> out<00:03:13.030> unless

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
so that the filter won't come out unless

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.940 
so that the filter won't come out unless
this<00:03:13.540> head<00:03:13.750> cup<00:03:13.959> comes<00:03:14.319> off<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:14.799> you'll

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
this head cup comes off so what you'll

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.309 
this head cup comes off so what you'll
ultimately<00:03:15.190> have<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.000> end<00:03:16.150> up<00:03:16.269> doing<00:03:16.329> is<00:03:16.750> dig

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
ultimately have to end up doing is dig

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.250 
ultimately have to end up doing is dig
around<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.970> sprinkler<00:03:19.389> head<00:03:19.569> enough<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.109> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
around the sprinkler head enough so that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.280 
around the sprinkler head enough so that
you<00:03:20.410> can<00:03:20.650> grab<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.549> body<00:03:21.790> enough<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.389> turn

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
you can grab the body enough to turn

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.500 
you can grab the body enough to turn
this<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:24.310> take<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.790> off<00:03:24.879> if<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.120> don't

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
this and and take it off if you don't

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.659 
this and and take it off if you don't
grab<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.870> body<00:03:26.290> when<00:03:26.889> you<00:03:27.010> turn<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.459> you

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
grab the body when you turn this you

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.819 
grab the body when you turn this you
might<00:03:27.849> end<00:03:28.090> up<00:03:28.299> actually<00:03:28.599> pulling<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
might end up actually pulling the

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.039 
might end up actually pulling the
sprinkler<00:03:30.310> itself<00:03:30.879> screwing<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.599> sprinkler

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
sprinkler itself screwing the sprinkler

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.409 
sprinkler itself screwing the sprinkler
off<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.440> riser<00:03:32.650> like<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:33.220> see<00:03:33.459> grabbing<00:03:34.329> the

off the riser like you see grabbing the

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.789 
off the riser like you see grabbing the
head<00:03:34.599> but<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.900> sprinkler<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.379> actually

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
head but the sprinkler is actually

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.289 
head but the sprinkler is actually
coming<00:03:36.099> off<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.370> riser<00:03:36.549> so<00:03:36.849> that's<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.150> bad

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
coming off the riser so that's a bad

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
this top and most wrinklies are going to

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.619 
this top and most wrinklies are going to
be<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.609> this<00:03:45.819> they're<00:03:46.000> going<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.209> have<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.329> top

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
head comes off the spring is just what

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.039 
head comes off the spring is just what
gives<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.069> pop-out<00:04:03.489> part<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.910> this

you<00:04:49.050> don't<00:04:49.200> have<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.440> make<00:04:49.560> sure<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.070> didn't

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
you don't have to make sure you didn't

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.370 
you don't have to make sure you didn't
change<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.820> orientation<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.750> your<00:04:51.810> sprinkler

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
change the orientation of your sprinkler

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.410 
change the orientation of your sprinkler
head<00:04:52.560> in<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.860> process<00:04:53.370> if<00:04:53.670> it<00:04:53.850> was<00:04:53.970> pointed<00:04:54.330> a

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
head in the process if it was pointed a

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.120 
head in the process if it was pointed a
certain<00:04:54.720> direction<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.680> took<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.920> out

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
certain direction and you took it out

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.250 
certain direction and you took it out
now<00:04:56.700> it's<00:04:56.880> pointing<00:04:57.180> another<00:04:57.420> direction<00:04:57.780> then

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
now it's pointing another direction then

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.990 
now it's pointing another direction then
you're<00:04:58.440> going<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> have<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.800> problem<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.760> is<00:04:59.820> a

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
you're going to have a problem this is a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.870 
you're going to have a problem this is a
360<00:05:00.900> degree<00:05:01.530> sprinkler<00:05:02.160> head<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.580> doesn't

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
360 degree sprinkler head so it doesn't

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.450 
360 degree sprinkler head so it doesn't
matter<00:05:03.000> anyway<00:05:03.300> but<00:05:03.960> if<00:05:04.110> you're<00:05:04.290> at<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.740> 90<00:05:05.250> and

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
matter anyway but if you're at a 90 and

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.490 
matter anyway but if you're at a 90 and
you<00:05:05.520> start<00:05:05.880> messing<00:05:06.720> around<00:05:06.960> with<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.380> in

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
you start messing around with it in

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.420 
you start messing around with it in
there<00:05:07.680> then<00:05:07.860> you're<00:05:08.010> going<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.220> probably

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
there then you're going to probably

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.700 
there then you're going to probably
change<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.150> orientation<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:10.200> you<00:05:10.320> need<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.590> be

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
change the orientation so you need to be

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.170 
change the orientation so you need to be
a<00:05:10.740> little<00:05:10.950> careful<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.580> might<00:05:11.730> need<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:12.060> do

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
a little careful you might need to do

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.700 
a little careful you might need to do
this<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.390> couple<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.840> times<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.290> get<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.500> back

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
this a couple of times to get it back

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.080 
this a couple of times to get it back
just<00:05:13.740> right<00:05:14.220> where<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.490> want<00:05:14.670> it<00:05:14.790> but<00:05:14.910> it's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
just right where you want it but it's

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.590 
just right where you want it but it's
very<00:05:15.240> easy<00:05:15.420> simple<00:05:16.320> way<00:05:16.380> of<00:05:17.270> taking<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.300> clog

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
very easy simple way of taking a clog

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.570 
very easy simple way of taking a clog
sprinkler<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.170> getting<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.710> back<00:05:19.740> into<00:05:20.280> into

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
sprinkler and getting it back into into

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.360 
sprinkler and getting it back into into
a<00:05:20.880> proper<00:05:21.270> working<00:05:21.510> order<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.380> if<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.220> have<00:05:23.340> a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
a proper working order so if you have a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.030 
a proper working order so if you have a
different<00:05:23.760> sprinkler<00:05:24.210> than<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.630> orbit<00:05:25.080> it's

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
different sprinkler than this orbit it's

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.460 
different sprinkler than this orbit it's
going<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.280> be<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> similar<00:05:26.940> type<00:05:27.510> of<00:05:27.540> operation

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
going to be a similar type of operation

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.810 
going to be a similar type of operation
you're<00:05:28.740> gonna<00:05:28.830> have<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.100> locate<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.610> filter

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
you're gonna have to locate the filter

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.310 
you're gonna have to locate the filter
you're<00:05:30.210> going<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.420> have<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:30.630> reassemble<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.290> in

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
you're going to have to reassemble it in

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.140 
you're going to have to reassemble it in
such<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> way<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:32.130> it's<00:05:32.280> spraying<00:05:32.550> in<00:05:32.790> the

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
such a way that it's spraying in the

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.030 
such a way that it's spraying in the
right<00:05:33.330> pattern<00:05:33.540> again<00:05:33.960> but<00:05:34.230> almost<00:05:34.830> all

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
right pattern again but almost all

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040 
right pattern again but almost all
sprinklers<00:05:35.460> function<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.030> same<00:05:36.270> sometimes

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
sprinklers function the same sometimes

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.350 
sprinklers function the same sometimes
it<00:05:37.500> might<00:05:37.590> be<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.800> bit<00:05:38.040> more<00:05:38.220> complex<00:05:38.700> the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
it might be a bit more complex the

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.290 
it might be a bit more complex the
sprinkler<00:05:39.840> has<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.290> ability<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.940> has<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:41.970> key

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
sprinkler has the ability to has a key

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.210 
sprinkler has the ability to has a key
to<00:05:42.540> where<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.140> can<00:05:43.350> adjust<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.980> spray

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
to where you can adjust the spray

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.190 
to where you can adjust the spray
pattern<00:05:44.460> then<00:05:44.910> you<00:05:44.940> might<00:05:45.240> have<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:46.170> might

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
pattern then you might have you might

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.320 
pattern then you might have you might
have<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.650> readjust<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.430> after<00:05:48.030> you're<00:05:48.180> done

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
have to readjust that after you're done

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.330 
have to readjust that after you're done
but<00:05:48.930> in<00:05:49.110> general<00:05:49.560> sprinklers<00:05:50.010> are<00:05:50.160> going<00:05:50.280> to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
but in general sprinklers are going to

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.560 
but in general sprinklers are going to
have<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:50.490> filter<00:05:50.820> they're<00:05:51.240> going<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.450> have<00:05:51.540> a

they're<00:05:53.880> going<00:05:54.000> to<00:05:54.060> have<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.180> little<00:05:54.450> rubber

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
they're going to have a little rubber

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.750 
they're going to have a little rubber
gasket<00:05:54.930> they're<00:05:55.800> almost<00:05:56.160> all<00:05:56.340> going<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.610> have

gasket they're almost all going to have
those<00:05:56.970> features<00:05:57.480> you<00:05:57.780> just<00:05:57.840> need<00:05:58.230> to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
those features you just need to

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.230 
those features you just need to
disassemble<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.130> in<00:05:59.460> such<00:05:59.700> a<00:05:59.730> way<00:05:59.850> that<00:06:00.120> you

disassemble it in such a way that you

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.150 
disassemble it in such a way that you
can<00:06:00.420> clean<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.810> filter<00:06:01.200> clean<00:06:01.710> whatever's

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
can clean the filter clean whatever's

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.950 
can clean the filter clean whatever's
clogged<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.730> then<00:06:02.880> reassemble<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.750> like

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
clogged and then reassemble it in like

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.230 
clogged and then reassemble it in like
manner
