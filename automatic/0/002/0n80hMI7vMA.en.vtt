with the b-flat try it on top so there's

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.720 
with the b-flat try it on top so there's

there's this which I think of as a flat
over<00:01:12.760> B<00:01:12.940> flat<00:01:13.150> like<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.900> four<00:01:14.140> chord<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.650> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
key of B flat is E flat over be typical

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.390

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.680 

I'm<00:03:22.470> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.770> do<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.420> thing

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
I'm going to do that one for one thing

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.010 
I'm going to do that one for one thing
again<00:03:25.580> with<00:03:26.580> F<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.150> there's<00:03:27.510> F<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.740> be<00:03:28.950> flat

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.920 

back<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.830> F<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.580> there's<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.330> step<00:03:34.660> back

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
back to F and then there's a step back

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.250 
back to F and then there's a step back
on<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.200> one<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.660> just<00:03:37.930> did<00:03:38.080> some

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
on the one and I just did some

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.210 
on the one and I just did some
aggressive<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:40.270> fill<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.870> space<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.470> then

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
aggressive to fill in the space and then

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.710 
aggressive to fill in the space and then
the<00:03:42.400> little<00:03:42.550> turnaround<00:03:43.000> at<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.360> end<00:03:43.510> there

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
the little turnaround at the end there

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.850 
the little turnaround at the end there
is<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:44.230> flat<00:03:44.740> flat<00:03:45.280> 7<00:03:45.580> chord<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.290> fork<00:03:47.530> or<00:03:47.740> D

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
is a flat flat 7 chord to the fork or D

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.200 
is a flat flat 7 chord to the fork or D
flat<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.930> one<00:03:50.170> chord<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.620> flat<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:52.150> I

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
flat to the one chord be flat and then I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.490 
flat to the one chord be flat and then I
added<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.780> little<00:03:54.900> little<00:03:55.900> single<00:03:56.170> no<00:03:56.260> roof

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
added a little little single no roof

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:10.080 
added a little little single no roof
based<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:56.950> b-flat<00:03:57.580> major<00:03:58.270> pentatonic<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:09.090> I

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
based on b-flat major pentatonic and I

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.780 
based on b-flat major pentatonic and I
played<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.750> simpler<00:04:11.200> if<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.560> first<00:04:11.740> time<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
played a simpler if the first time and

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.400 
played a simpler if the first time and
then<00:04:16.270> a<00:04:16.299> little<00:04:16.480> bit<00:04:16.690> more<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.049> complicated

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
then a little bit more of a complicated

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.240 
then a little bit more of a complicated
riff<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.920> second<00:04:18.250> time<00:04:22.110> and<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:24.040> know<00:04:24.130> an

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
riff the second time and you know an

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.090 
riff the second time and you know an
interesting<00:04:24.760> thing<00:04:25.030> overall<00:04:25.390> is<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.740> back

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
interesting thing overall is that back

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.980 
interesting thing overall is that back
in<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.460> 50s<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:29.080> early<00:04:29.410> 60s<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.990> rhythm

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
in the 50s and early 60s the rhythm

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.020 
in the 50s and early 60s the rhythm
guitar<00:04:32.290> or<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.770> guitar<00:04:32.980> would<00:04:33.400> play<00:04:33.580> very

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
guitar or the guitar would play very

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.180 
guitar or the guitar would play very
basic<00:04:34.420> parts<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.020> horns<00:04:35.470> would<00:04:35.830> be<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
basic parts and the horns would be the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.630 
basic parts and the horns would be the
instruments<00:04:36.730> applying<00:04:37.210> those<00:04:37.870> upper<00:04:41.640> motivic

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
instruments applying those upper motivic

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.660 
instruments applying those upper motivic
sounds<00:04:43.330> but<00:04:43.960> rock<00:04:44.260> guitar<00:04:44.650> players<00:04:44.950> in<00:04:45.370> the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
sounds but rock guitar players in the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.500 
sounds but rock guitar players in the
early<00:04:46.180> 60s<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.780> into<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.110> mid-60s<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.510> late

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
early 60s and into the mid-60s and late

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.960 
early 60s and into the mid-60s and late
60s<00:04:50.080> started<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.950> incorporate<00:04:51.070> those<00:04:51.610> horn

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
60s started to incorporate those horn

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.610 
60s started to incorporate those horn
figures<00:04:52.330> into<00:04:52.540> their<00:04:52.780> guitar<00:04:53.080> parts<00:04:53.440> and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
figures into their guitar parts and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.490 
figures into their guitar parts and
that's<00:04:54.310> how<00:04:55.000> Clapton<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.870> Hendricks<00:04:56.350> and

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
that's how Clapton and Hendricks and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.080 
that's how Clapton and Hendricks and
Jimmy<00:04:56.740> Page<00:04:56.920> came<00:04:57.190> up<00:04:57.340> with<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.610> many<00:04:57.730> cool

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
Jimmy Page came up with so many cool

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.780 
Jimmy Page came up with so many cool
riffs<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.230> then<00:04:59.920> just<00:05:00.130> became<00:05:00.400> part<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.730> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
riffs that then just became part of the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.920 
riffs that then just became part of the
lexicon<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.330> what<00:05:01.600> rock<00:05:01.780> guitar<00:05:02.140> is<00:05:02.380> all<00:05:02.620> about
