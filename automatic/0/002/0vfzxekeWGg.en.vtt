first<00:00:37.269> of<00:00:37.390> all<00:00:37.510> let's<00:00:37.839> get<00:00:38.170> this<00:00:38.229> one<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.530> them

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.830 

fit<00:00:44.530> where<00:00:44.799> I<00:00:44.830> can<00:00:45.070> see<00:00:45.309> lots<00:00:46.059> more

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.250 

Oh<00:00:51.900> case<00:00:52.860> definitely<00:00:53.370> looks<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:53.970> smaller

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.180 

hopefully<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.470> going<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:59.120> big<00:01:00.120> enough

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
hopefully it's going to be big enough

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.990 
hopefully it's going to be big enough
okay<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:05.000> monster

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

details about 115 in comparison you can

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.340 
details about 115 in comparison you can
see<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> difference<00:01:30.050> think<00:01:31.050> they<00:01:31.110> said<00:01:31.259> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
see the difference think they said this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.969 
see the difference think they said this
one's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> 19<00:01:32.100> litre<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> wear

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
one's a 19 litre and that is it wear

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.120 
one's a 19 litre and that is it wear
this<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:36.170> don't<00:01:37.170> remember<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> capacity

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this one I don't remember the capacity

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.389 
this one I don't remember the capacity
but<00:01:38.340> you've<00:01:38.610> got<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.660> then<00:01:40.410> got<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.130> zip

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
but you've got this and then got the zip

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.020 
but you've got this and then got the zip
to<00:01:41.580> make<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:41.970> bigger<00:01:42.180> capacity<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.930> well<00:01:44.030> no

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to make it a bigger capacity as well no

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670 
to make it a bigger capacity as well no
so<00:01:45.509> yeah<00:01:45.690> it's<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> lot<00:01:45.960> smaller<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so yeah it's a lot smaller than what I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.770 
so yeah it's a lot smaller than what I
thought<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:51.800> okay<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:52.860> you've<00:01:53.160> got

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
thought it would be okay so you've got

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
thought it would be okay so you've got
got<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> helmet<00:01:55.080> carrier<00:01:55.619> likewise<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
got the helmet carrier likewise in this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.040 
got the helmet carrier likewise in this
one<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.209> well<00:01:59.090> nice<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.300> feature<00:02:00.569> but<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050
