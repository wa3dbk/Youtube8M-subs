when<00:00:00.510> bench-pressing<00:00:01.079> there's<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.380> huge

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
when bench-pressing there's a huge

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.070 
when bench-pressing there's a huge
difference<00:00:01.890> between<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.669> natural<00:00:03.389> arc<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
difference between a natural arc and a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.980 
difference between a natural arc and a
forced<00:00:04.589> arc<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.279> four<00:00:05.700> start<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.240> when<00:00:06.839> you

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
forced arc a four start is when you

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.220 
forced arc a four start is when you
intentionally<00:00:07.980> arch<00:00:08.610> your<00:00:08.820> lower<00:00:08.940> back<00:00:09.230> to

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
intentionally arch your lower back to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.390 
intentionally arch your lower back to
decreased<00:00:10.710> range<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.010> motion

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
decreased range of motion

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.799 
decreased range of motion
okay<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:11.790> there's<00:00:12.059> not<00:00:12.150> any<00:00:12.360> tightness

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
okay so there's not any tightness

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.539 
okay so there's not any tightness
established<00:00:13.500> you're<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.130> arching<00:00:14.519> your

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
established you're just arching your

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.490 
established you're just arching your
lower<00:00:14.700> back<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.900> want<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> big

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
lower back because you want to be a big

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.750 
lower back because you want to be a big
shot<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> want<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> lift<00:00:17.369> more<00:00:17.520> weights

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
shot and you want to lift more weights

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.370 
shot and you want to lift more weights
that's<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.660> not<00:00:18.810> good<00:00:19.020> you're<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.289> gonna

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
that's just not good you're just gonna

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470 
that's just not good you're just gonna
end<00:00:19.619> up<00:00:19.770> putting<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.189> behind<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.760> no<00:00:20.910> reason

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
end up putting it behind for no reason

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900 
end up putting it behind for no reason
on<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> other<00:00:21.930> hand<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.320> natural<00:00:22.800> arc<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.609> far

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
on the other hand a natural arc it's far

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.820 
on the other hand a natural arc it's far
different<00:00:23.939> okay<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.840> reason<00:00:25.050> why<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.529> test

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
different okay the reason why your test

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.589 
different okay the reason why your test
elevates<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:27.480> you're

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
elevates it's not because you're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
elevates it's not because you're
squeezing<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.050> lower<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.439> muscles<00:00:28.740> it's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
squeezing your lower back muscles it's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
squeezing your lower back muscles it's
because<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.699> fact<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.689> squeezing

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
because of the fact that just squeezing

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
because of the fact that just squeezing
your<00:00:31.380> glutes<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:32.279> pressing<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:32.669> heels

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
your glutes you're pressing your heels

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.850 
your glutes you're pressing your heels
tied<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> ground<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> you're

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
tied into the ground and you're

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
tied into the ground and you're
retracting<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.489> scapula<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> combination

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
retracting the scapula the combination

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080 
retracting the scapula the combination
of<00:00:37.350> those<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:37.800> things<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.879> caused

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
of those three things is what caused

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.540 
of those three things is what caused
your<00:00:39.270> chest<00:00:39.480> elevate<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.680> chest<00:00:40.980> elevation

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
your chest elevate the chest elevation

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
your chest elevate the chest elevation
is<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> goal<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> chest<00:00:42.629> elevation<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is not the goal the chest elevation is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.080 
is not the goal the chest elevation is
simply<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> side<00:00:43.800> effect<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.879> what

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
simply a side effect because that's what

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
simply a side effect because that's what
happens<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.379> tight<00:00:46.680> okay<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
happens when you get tight okay when you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
happens when you get tight okay when you
don't<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.360> tight<00:00:48.660> pressing<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.320> shitty

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
don't get tight pressing off a shitty

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.020 
don't get tight pressing off a shitty
base<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.219> gonna<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.579> injured<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
base and you're gonna get injured a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.930 
base and you're gonna get injured a
natural<00:00:51.629> arc<00:00:52.100> which<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> what<00:00:53.460> I'll<00:00:53.579> refer<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
natural arc which is what I'll refer to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
natural arc which is what I'll refer to
as<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> power<00:00:54.660> bench<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> same<00:00:56.190> thing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
as a power bench is not the same thing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.189 
as a power bench is not the same thing
if<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> stand<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
if you stand up right now and you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
if you stand up right now and you
squeeze<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.559> glutes<00:00:58.800> you'll<00:00:59.789> notice

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
squeeze your glutes you'll notice

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
squeeze your glutes you'll notice
squeeze<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.570> glutes<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:01.590> body's<00:01:01.920> gonna

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
squeeze your glutes your body's gonna

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
squeeze your glutes your body's gonna
naturally<00:01:02.579> come<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.940> way<00:01:03.149> okay<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
naturally come this way okay it's not

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.000 
naturally come this way okay it's not
because<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.320> arching<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.680> lower<00:01:04.860> back

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
because I'm arching my lower back

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
because I'm arching my lower back
arching<00:01:05.400> your<00:01:05.430> lower<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.510> be

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
arching your lower back will just be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
arching your lower back will just be
this<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> arching<00:01:07.560> lower<00:01:07.710> back<00:01:07.939> it's<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
this this is arching lower back it's the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
this this is arching lower back it's the
difference<00:01:09.360> between<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.810> shit<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.920> just

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
difference between this shit and just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.770 
difference between this shit and just
squeezing<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> glutes<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> big

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
squeezing the glutes there's a big

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.990 
squeezing the glutes there's a big
difference<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> squeeze<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
difference and when you squeeze the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
difference and when you squeeze the
scapula<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.350> when<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> squeeze<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> sky<00:01:17.130> club

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
scapula so when you squeeze the sky club

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
scapula so when you squeeze the sky club
and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.850> squeeze<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> glutes<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> have

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and you squeeze the glutes now you have

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
and you squeeze the glutes now you have
the<00:01:19.080> crease<00:01:19.259> range<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> motion<00:01:20.360> there's<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the crease range of motion there's a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
the crease range of motion there's a
difference<00:01:21.659> between<00:01:21.720> ax<00:01:22.080> hip<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
difference between ax hip and just

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.210 
difference between ax hip and just
arching<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.180> lower<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.159> think<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
arching your lower back I think you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.929 
arching your lower back I think you
could<00:01:26.340> immediately<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> difference

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
could immediately see the difference

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.190 
could immediately see the difference
even<00:01:27.479> though<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.990> fucking

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
even though I don't have a fucking

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
even though I don't have a fucking
barbell<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.770> me<00:01:28.979> okay<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> good<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
barbell with me okay one is good the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
barbell with me okay one is good the
other<00:01:30.750> isn't<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> also<00:01:31.710> want<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
other isn't and I also want to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
other isn't and I also want to
understand<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.909> range<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> motion

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
understand that the range of motion

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
understand that the range of motion
decrease<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.280> goal<00:01:35.460> okay<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.150> feel

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
decrease is not the goal okay I feel

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440 
decrease is not the goal okay I feel
like<00:01:36.509> six<00:01:36.750> foot<00:01:36.930> five<00:01:37.170> okay<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:39.060> even

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
like six foot five okay and you even

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.640 
like six foot five okay and you even
though<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:39.689> tight<00:01:39.960> you're<00:01:40.320> squeezing<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
though you're tight you're squeezing the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
though you're tight you're squeezing the
scapula<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.220> squeezing<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> glutes<00:01:42.020> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
scapula you're squeezing the glutes but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.660 
scapula you're squeezing the glutes but
you<00:01:43.170> still<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.070> chest<00:01:44.340> super

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you still don't have your chest super

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
you still don't have your chest super
elevated<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> big<00:01:45.930> problem<00:01:45.979> what

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
elevated that's not a big problem what

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.130 
elevated that's not a big problem what
matters<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.090> tight<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.020> are

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
matters is that you are tight if you are

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
matters is that you are tight if you are
tight<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.189> bench<00:01:50.399> pressing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
tight then you are bench pressing

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.280 
tight then you are bench pressing
properly<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.350> you're<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.740> tight<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.670> ages

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
properly if you're not tight a to ages

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.450 
properly if you're not tight a to ages
arching<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.350> lower<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.070> tackle

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
arching your lower back but your tackle

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.740 
arching your lower back but your tackle
is<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.670> retracted<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.360> shoulders<00:01:57.659> are

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
is not retracted so your shoulders are

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
is not retracted so your shoulders are
up<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.439> you're<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.040> driving<00:01:59.219> heels

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
up here and you're not driving heels

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.950 
up here and you're not driving heels
into<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> ground<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.659> good

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
into the ground and that's not good

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
into the ground and that's not good
even<00:02:01.229> though<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.890> range<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.250> motion<00:02:02.369> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
even though the range of motion is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940 
even though the range of motion is
decreased<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.899> not<00:02:04.049> tight<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.590> that's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
decreased you're not tight and that's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.440 
decreased you're not tight and that's
where<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> injuries<00:02:05.549> come<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:05.969> that's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
where the injuries come from that's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
where the injuries come from that's
where<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.780> lose<00:02:06.960> strength<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.099> some

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
where you lose strength so when some

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.619 
where you lose strength so when some
there's<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> big<00:02:08.700> difference<00:02:09.119> between<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
there's a big difference between a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.660 
there's a big difference between a
natural<00:02:10.170> arc<00:02:10.649> versus<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.099> forest

natural arc versus a forest

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.890 
natural arc versus a forest
arc<00:02:11.819> okay

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
arc okay

you're retracting the scapula which
