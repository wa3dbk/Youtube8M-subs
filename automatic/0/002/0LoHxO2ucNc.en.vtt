on red dot sight versus each other

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.599 
on red dot sight versus each other
this<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> strictly<00:00:18.449> iron<00:00:18.750> sights<00:00:19.609> alright

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
this one is strictly iron sights alright

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.029 
this one is strictly iron sights alright
so<00:00:20.850> we're<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> start<00:00:21.420> off<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.039> m4

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
so we're going to start off with the m4

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.380 
so we're going to start off with the m4
word<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:24.140> hundred-yard<00:00:25.140> target

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
word this is a hundred-yard target

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.040 
word this is a hundred-yard target
alright<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.490> got<00:00:29.670> three<00:00:30.510> rounds<00:00:30.900> right

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
alright so we got three rounds right

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620 
alright so we got three rounds right
here<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.610> one<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.820> three<00:00:32.850> rounds<00:00:33.510> right

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
there so that's 100 yards with iron

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.290

not<00:00:39.300> bad<00:00:39.510> grouping<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:41.329> actually<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> take

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
not bad grouping I actually got to take

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.250 
not bad grouping I actually got to take
my<00:00:43.520> m4<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.329> trigger<00:00:45.660> group<00:00:45.840> fixed

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
my m4 in to get the trigger group fixed

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
my m4 in to get the trigger group fixed
because<00:00:46.670> every<00:00:47.670> once<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> while<00:00:47.969> it'll<00:00:48.450> fire

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
because every once a while it'll fire

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
because every once a while it'll fire
off<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:49.140> rounds<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.680> three<00:00:49.890> rounds<00:00:50.250> instead

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
off two rounds or three rounds instead

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
off two rounds or three rounds instead
of<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.820> which<00:00:51.180> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> seems<00:00:51.600> cool<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:51.989> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of one which kind of seems cool but it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.889 
of one which kind of seems cool but it's
really<00:00:52.410> inconsistent<00:00:53.809> especially<00:00:54.809> when

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
really inconsistent especially when

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.540
