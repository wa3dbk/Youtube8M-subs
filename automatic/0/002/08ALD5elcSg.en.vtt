00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
kind of material then I think this is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.130 
kind of material then I think this is
kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> fly<00:01:57.420> wire<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:58.020> of

kind of like the fly wire kind of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.880 
kind of like the fly wire kind of
synthetic<00:01:58.380> stuff<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.049> standard<00:02:01.530> shoe
