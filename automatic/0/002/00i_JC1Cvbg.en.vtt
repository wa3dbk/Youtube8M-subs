00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
games and was not a fun way to go out

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.630 
games and was not a fun way to go out
and<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.710> know<00:04:54.740> we<00:04:54.890> got<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.100> find<00:04:55.280> no<00:04:55.460> way<00:04:55.580> to

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
and you know we got to find no way to

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.640

play better and more solid hockey game
I<00:04:57.680> think<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.370> last<00:04:58.910> games<00:04:59.440> finishing<00:05:00.440> out<00:05:00.530> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
I think the last games finishing out the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.250 
I think the last games finishing out the
season<00:05:00.950> are<00:05:01.070> really<00:05:01.280> important<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.880> can't

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
season are really important you can't

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.570 
season are really important you can't
just<00:05:03.260> turn<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:03.650> in<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.830> playoffs<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:04.370> want

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
your game being as good as it can

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.140 
your game being as good as it can

situation for our team but that you know
is<00:06:17.190> a<00:06:17.220> part<00:06:17.580> of<00:06:17.669> playoff<00:06:17.970> hockey<00:06:18.210> it's<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.630> big

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
is a part of playoff hockey it's a big

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.540 
is a part of playoff hockey it's a big
part<00:06:19.080> of<00:06:19.139> playoff<00:06:19.470> hockey<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:20.100> that

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
part of playoff hockey and that

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.600 
part of playoff hockey and that
emotional<00:06:21.000> control<00:06:21.860> keeping<00:06:22.860> focused<00:06:23.310> on<00:06:23.460> our

game and what we do is a focus for our
game<00:06:25.860> and<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.220> think<00:06:26.460> we<00:06:26.580> can<00:06:26.760> continue<00:06:27.150> to

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
game and I think we can continue to

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.860 
game and I think we can continue to
expect<00:06:27.930> that<00:06:28.080> be<00:06:28.979> unexpected<00:06:29.910> defines<00:06:30.570> the
