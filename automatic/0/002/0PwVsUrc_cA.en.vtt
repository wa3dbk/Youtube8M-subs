this review of the commando wire saw so

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.660 
this review of the commando wire saw so
i've<00:00:17.920> had<00:00:18.190> some<00:00:18.940> of<00:00:19.030> these<00:00:19.119> riding<00:00:19.690> in<00:00:19.810> my

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
i've had some of these riding in my

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
i've had some of these riding in my
survival<00:00:21.670> kit<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:22.770> figured<00:00:23.850> while<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:24.880> was

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
survival kit and figured while I was

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.570 
survival kit and figured while I was
testing<00:00:26.320> out<00:00:26.410> some<00:00:26.650> other<00:00:26.770> saws<00:00:27.070> I<00:00:27.340> might<00:00:27.490> as

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
testing out some other saws I might as

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.570 
testing out some other saws I might as
well<00:00:27.730> break<00:00:28.420> this<00:00:28.750> thing<00:00:29.020> out<00:00:29.260> and<00:00:29.590> I<00:00:30.370> never

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
well break this thing out and I never

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.310 
well break this thing out and I never
bought<00:00:30.850> this<00:00:31.060> intending<00:00:31.750> it<00:00:31.870> to<00:00:31.990> be<00:00:32.110> my

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
bought this intending it to be my

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.130 
bought this intending it to be my
primary<00:00:32.680> saw<00:00:33.250> it<00:00:33.640> was<00:00:34.329> just<00:00:34.629> more<00:00:34.870> of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
primary saw it was just more of

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.990 
primary saw it was just more of
something<00:00:35.950> that<00:00:36.219> was<00:00:36.480> lightweight<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:39.000> I've

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
something that was lightweight that I've

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.960 
something that was lightweight that I've
seen<00:00:40.420> some<00:00:40.720> other<00:00:40.900> reviews<00:00:41.290> on<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.800> if<00:00:42.220> you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
seen some other reviews on and if you

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.540 
seen some other reviews on and if you
had<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:43.600> pinch<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:44.170> could<00:00:44.620> um<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:45.370> could

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
had to in a pinch you could um you could

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.030 
had to in a pinch you could um you could
use<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:46.060> cut<00:00:46.239> through<00:00:46.450> some<00:00:46.630> wood<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:48.010> I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
use this to cut through some wood so I

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.220 
use this to cut through some wood so I
figured<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.910> would<00:00:48.940> go<00:00:49.210> ahead<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.480> do<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.930> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
figured I would go ahead and do that and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.280 
figured I would go ahead and do that and
you'll<00:00:53.230> see<00:00:53.410> here<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:53.710> this<00:00:53.829> video<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:55.360> it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
you'll see here in this video that it

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.920 
you'll see here in this video that it
looks<00:00:56.560> pretty<00:00:56.800> promising<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.700> I'm<00:00:58.630> cutting

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
looks pretty promising and I'm cutting

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.470 
looks pretty promising and I'm cutting
through<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.520> wood<00:01:00.520> it<00:01:01.090> looks<00:01:01.300> like

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
through the wood it looks like

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.970 
through the wood it looks like
everything's<00:01:01.930> going<00:01:02.290> good<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.649> then<00:01:02.770> it<00:01:02.950> uh

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
everything's going good and then it uh

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.800 
everything's going good and then it uh
it<00:01:03.940> binds<00:01:04.269> up<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.820> know<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.210> have<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.600> take

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
it binds up so you know I have to take

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.360 
it binds up so you know I have to take
it<00:01:07.990> completely<00:01:08.110> out<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:09.450> try<00:01:10.450> again<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.650> I'm

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
it completely out and try again and I'm

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.190 
it completely out and try again and I'm
just<00:01:12.549> going<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.790> tell<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.150> that<00:01:13.360> unless

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
just going to tell you that unless

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.149 
just going to tell you that unless
you're<00:01:14.409> cutting<00:01:14.680> through<00:01:14.770> some<00:01:15.010> small

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
you're cutting through some small

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.180 
you're cutting through some small
branches<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:17.409> know<00:01:17.530> this<00:01:17.680> branch<00:01:17.979> I'm

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
branches and you know this branch I'm

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.370 
branches and you know this branch I'm
cutting<00:01:18.520> through<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:19.060> could<00:01:19.270> be<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.960> size<00:01:20.200> of

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
cutting through it could be the size of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.500 
cutting through it could be the size of
some<00:01:20.560> small<00:01:20.830> trees<00:01:21.130> or<00:01:21.340> something<00:01:21.700> but<00:01:21.909> you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
some small trees or something but you

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.930 
some small trees or something but you
know<00:01:22.540> hey<00:01:23.320> if<00:01:23.799> this<00:01:24.040> is<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.369> only<00:01:24.610> thing<00:01:24.790> you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
know hey if this is the only thing you

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.120 
know hey if this is the only thing you
have<00:01:25.150> good<00:01:25.930> luck<00:01:26.140> trying<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.530> build<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.890> lean-to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
have good luck trying to build a lean-to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.149 
have good luck trying to build a lean-to
or<00:01:27.490> something<00:01:27.909> if<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.900> only<00:01:28.930> uh<00:01:29.260> saw

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
or something if this is the only uh saw

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.160 
or something if this is the only uh saw
that<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:30.940> you<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.390> it's<00:01:31.930> going<00:01:32.110> to

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that you have on you it it's going to

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.730 
that you have on you it it's going to
require<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.920> my<00:01:33.040> opinion<00:01:33.549> way<00:01:33.820> more<00:01:34.240> calories

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
require in my opinion way more calories

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.080 
require in my opinion way more calories
than<00:01:35.740> if<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:36.130> would<00:01:36.280> have<00:01:36.340> just<00:01:36.400> packed<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
than if you would have just packed a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.050 
than if you would have just packed a
little<00:01:37.210> bit<00:01:37.479> extra<00:01:37.869> weight<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.500> brought<00:01:39.220> like

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
little bit extra weight and brought like

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.350 
little bit extra weight and brought like
a<00:01:40.090> folding<00:01:40.600> saw<00:01:40.840> or<00:01:41.140> something<00:01:41.530> with<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.670> now

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
a folding saw or something with you now

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.420 
a folding saw or something with you now
that<00:01:43.420> being<00:01:43.780> said<00:01:43.900> I'm<00:01:44.439> not<00:01:44.680> going<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.100> away

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
that being said I'm not going to do away

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.640 
that being said I'm not going to do away
with<00:01:45.460> these<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.360> I'm<00:01:46.689> not<00:01:46.840> giving<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.409> fail

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
with these and I'm not giving it a fail

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.280 
with these and I'm not giving it a fail
review<00:01:48.159> even<00:01:48.369> though<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.240> was<00:01:49.450> difficult<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
review even though it was difficult it

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.130 
review even though it was difficult it
obviously<00:01:50.979> could<00:01:51.340> be<00:01:51.400> done<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:52.900> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
obviously could be done one of the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.969 
obviously could be done one of the
things<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.790> realized<00:01:55.299> is<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:56.500> angle

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
things that that I realized is the angle

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.850 
things that that I realized is the angle
of<00:01:57.250> your<00:01:57.280> your<00:01:58.200> approach<00:01:59.200> when<00:01:59.770> you're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
of your your approach when you're

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.330 
of your your approach when you're
cutting<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.900> natural<00:02:02.500> tendency<00:02:03.070> is

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
cutting on this the natural tendency is

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.850 
cutting on this the natural tendency is
to<00:02:04.299> have<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:06.220> saw<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.119> more<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.600> u

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
to have the saw and more of a u

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.710 
to have the saw and more of a u
configuration<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:09.069> you're<00:02:09.939> going<00:02:10.209> around<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
configuration as you're going around the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.319 
configuration as you're going around the
branch<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:12.220> that's<00:02:12.370> when<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.670> binding<00:02:12.879> seems

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
branch but that's when the binding seems

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.759 
branch but that's when the binding seems
to<00:02:13.510> occur<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.959> seems<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.439> only<00:02:14.560> way

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
to occur and it seems like the only way

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.860 
to occur and it seems like the only way
I<00:02:14.829> could<00:02:14.950> keep<00:02:15.069> sawing<00:02:15.550> through<00:02:15.870> this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
I could keep sawing through this

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.760 
I could keep sawing through this
particular<00:02:17.110> branch<00:02:18.010> was<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.880> try<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> keep<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
particular branch was to try to keep the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.520 
particular branch was to try to keep the
the<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:22.360> saw<00:02:22.660> wire<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.860> flat<00:02:24.700> as<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.240> possible

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the the saw wire as flat as as possible

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.310 
the the saw wire as flat as as possible
more<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.190> would<00:02:27.880> be<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> traditional<00:02:29.050> saw

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
more like would be on a traditional saw

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.480 
more like would be on a traditional saw
so<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:31.570> would<00:02:32.050> require<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.980> lot<00:02:33.310> more

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
so that would require a lot more

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.730 
so that would require a lot more
calories<00:02:33.700> as<00:02:34.150> well<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.570> it's<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.780> lot<00:02:35.530> less

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
calories as well and it's a lot less

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.390 
calories as well and it's a lot less
ergonomic<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.670> natural<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.370> it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
ergonomic and natural to do to do it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.790 
ergonomic and natural to do to do it
that<00:02:39.700> way<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:43.000> being<00:02:43.180> said<00:02:43.560> I'm<00:02:44.560> still

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
that way now that being said I'm still

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.790 
that way now that being said I'm still
going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.640> my<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:46.270> my<00:02:46.930> emergency

going to have this in my in my emergency

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.960 
lightweight and you know you go on a day
hike<00:02:55.570> or<00:02:55.900> something<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.550> can<00:02:57.700> coil

hike or something you can you can coil

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.740 
hike or something you can you can coil
this<00:02:58.240> up<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:59.040> you<00:03:00.040> won't<00:03:00.220> even<00:03:00.340> realize<00:03:01.330> it's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
this up and you won't even realize it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.530 
this up and you won't even realize it's
there<00:03:01.900> weighs<00:03:02.260> next<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.770> nothing<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.390> if<00:03:04.390> you

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
there weighs next to nothing and if you

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.670 
there weighs next to nothing and if you
did<00:03:04.720> need<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.960> cut<00:03:05.200> through<00:03:05.350> some<00:03:05.530> small

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
did need to cut through some small

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.530 
did need to cut through some small
branches<00:03:06.250> or<00:03:06.400> something<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.970> could<00:03:07.090> still<00:03:07.360> do

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
branches or something you could still do

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.560 
branches or something you could still do
it<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> other<00:03:08.800> thing<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.570> this

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
it and then the other thing is this

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.630 
it and then the other thing is this
particular<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.230> believe<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.650> was<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> cog

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
particular one I believe this was a cog

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.660 
particular one I believe this was a cog
lens<00:03:12.910> brand<00:03:13.260> as<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.650> see<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.040> passes

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
lens brand as you can see this passes

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.870 
lens brand as you can see this passes
through<00:03:16.740> one<00:03:17.740> bring<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.340> bigger<00:03:18.550> than<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
through one bring is bigger than the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.990 
through one bring is bigger than the
other<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.800> they<00:03:20.800> say<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.460> can<00:03:21.640> use<00:03:21.820> this

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
other and they say that you can use this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.760 
other and they say that you can use this
as<00:03:22.240> a<00:03:22.270> snare<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:24.480> I'm<00:03:25.480> going<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.200> hang<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.740> it

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
as a snare so I'm going to hang on to it

used this i've never stared anything I'm

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.620 
used this i've never stared anything I'm
not<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.350> I'm<00:03:32.650> not<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.860> trapper<00:03:33.400> I'm<00:03:34.000> not<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> hunter

so I couldn't tell you if that works or

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.410 
so I couldn't tell you if that works or
if<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.950> would<00:03:39.130> work<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.430> as<00:03:39.820> good<00:03:39.880> as<00:03:40.180> better

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
if it would work just as good as better
