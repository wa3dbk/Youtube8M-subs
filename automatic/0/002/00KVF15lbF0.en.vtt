00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.469
 from black ops 2 here on my channel 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 today we play again or already 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.900
 for a long time no longer one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.119
 party games 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 this is something like a running weapon in the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.869
 play and so on and me personally 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 Sniper would be really horny because of it 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.119
 simply just really cool 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.289
 unfair because every one of these i feel 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 But I would not have this with myself 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.590
 what annoys and how I sometimes talk 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.730
 somehow so funny and the highest 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.450
 I can not improve myself at all 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.180
 yes only the tidying up the skateboard 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.780
 map is still missing something kate moss 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.460
 then the possible geilmann is but 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 Unfortunately there are no skateboards 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 that's why it's not a real map 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.550
 No, no, you look for the people 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.379
 who do not know how it works and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.030
 Although you can see the top of the map to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.050
 one of the markets I currently always 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.640
 so that everything does not take so long 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 The guy is totally on even that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 Let's replace it 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.340
 I mean what really okay that I this 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.270
 that's the kind of luck you have to have 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880
 also admit he will probably 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.030
 fight for it now 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.330
 Well, of course, if everyone does it where 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.190
 is yes 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.060
 it can not be true or one 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.190
 Please take a moment 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.950
 so my friend so everyone has the same 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.350
 weapon and well kills exactly one changes 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.440
 Do not forget the weapon and all 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.180
 It will be five 40 seconds 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.030
 I come, I think, yes, he 's coming 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.880
 be here somewhere that I'm doing this one 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.800
 serious is the type of hog only here 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 only to make the gun what you do not 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.000
 Weakness is because I am because of me 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.840
 left handed is not that fast 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.280
 can shoot 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.210
 unfortunately I have no heads of mine 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.910
 for my xbox 360 because of that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.010
 problematic and so is the relief 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.080
 where concert card times look 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.310
 man man man man man becomes easier 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.209
 has me to country I put you where 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.530
 is the man who came to ireland was the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.160
 club history my friends 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 that was a very short story oh 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.500
 my god so you see I already 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.070
 I do not shoot really fast 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.310
 use that as that is something me 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.560
 that makes it easier for me to do kills 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.750
 all right without a sniper ok 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.160
 If it's the biggest fan I'm here 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.440
 black ops but well why not there 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.120
 At the back of a where is it there he is fruit 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.250
 that was yes, unfortunately I have the wrong one 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.660
 control on two pairs now stay off 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.820
 provide the wrong control 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.180
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, but you can 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.700
 nothing is going on that way 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 is the shit by 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.129
 I will not be ultra mega tricks now 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.060
 come because I want that too now 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.790
 I almost win this one 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 that's unexpected that's how 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.890
 she knows it 's so easy to tame 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.680
 you me master here today control 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.239
 unfortunately has the tax 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 finally finally I have finally 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.700
 forgot to switch because I have this 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.519
 spontaneously record round where is here 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.760
 is 100 per cent he gets going on or 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.760
 neither 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.769
 we would have that no, I was private 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.349
 let me change time that was okay 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.690
 construct occupancy tactics here what was 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.870
 that much better now 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.120
 that you have so good unfortunately no xbox 360 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.390
 unfortunately not my friends 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.890
 but what do you do? 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.540
 to which I have not seen typ 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.370
 that was very close my friends 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.480
 very very close I am doing that 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.349
 wants to win this seriously so it can 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.299
 yes, not his or her 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.530
 I would not like to upload something where I am 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.340
 do not win , let's be honest 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.560
 but I can not stop here now 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.420
 yes it should be me the problem is already 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.120
 people i'm better than the sorry that 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.410
 So that's the way it is right now but say you 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.630
 it really has to look like that 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.600
 it's so that you're something here somewhere 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.489
 youtube lies all the time is a 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.729
 little fun you really have to 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.660
 So if I lose now then give 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.669
 is very unfair 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:28.940
 then I do not know what exactly going on 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:30.870
 is the guy back there is something going on 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.860
 concentrate on you mobile concentrated i 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.840
 believe me that can change faster than 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.710
 you can imagine that you can 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.780
 change quickly that you guys 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.099
 can imagine or type it behind me 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.699
 like a new weapon 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.499
 o2 with a guy of the city no he has 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:50.419
 Shit on me is shit 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:53.379
 I am full of fun and fun as much as I am 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.550
 with 60 points which is very nice but 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.129
 which does not mean anything else 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.319

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.069

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.759

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.159

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:30.370
 I would say many children in the game 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:32.479
 yes i think that the battery is hello 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.529

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.999
 there must be traces of land here 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.370
 very often so always on the map 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.509
 That's what I see 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.020
 not quite like he can not see me 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.419
 my first band is exactly my god 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.620
 god god is pouring out so if you have more 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.909
 of it wants to see it in any case 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.409
 thumb up 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.360
 then I like to do much more 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.499
 party games for you when he has time 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.979
 Sometimes the best thing I do is 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:59.810
 can 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.069
 with the red end but that will be in the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.169
 not somehow do not know 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.539
 generally call of duty has the feeling 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.979
 not many people want to see that because 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.419
 in the moment just so you all know 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.949
 Everyone knows my call of duty 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.209
 meanwhile, that's why I'm waiting 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.709
 personally on cod is when you more 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:14.870
 to see it clicks on the thumb 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:17.180
 above button and i will be much much more 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.709
 make so much because you have to look your 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.889
 and that was the last I got 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:26.240
 won second place with 28 12 220 points 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.800
 only had a lot less than me but a lot 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.050
 less points because he died more often 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.159
 did not even die more often 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.719
 okay, but I had in any case 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.339
 he has to get enough 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.020
 Do not forget proven and I'm in 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.189
 subscribe to the next video again and 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.870
 deflected in the description entrances 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:43.029
 pine never thought why always forget that 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.029
 he looks over to say
