see<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.640> further<00:01:47.820> back<00:01:48.320> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
see it's it's a little further back the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
see it's it's a little further back the
new<00:01:49.530> part<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> underneath<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> mounting

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
new part is underneath as the mounting

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
new part is underneath as the mounting
there's<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:52.049> pins<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.590> no<00:01:52.770> got<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.430> into

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
there's two pins that no got now go into

there's two pins that no got now go into
a<00:01:53.729> stainless<00:01:54.060> steel<00:01:54.240> block<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.110> while<00:01:55.680> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
a stainless steel block and while it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
a stainless steel block and while it's
very<00:01:55.920> stiff<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.390> difficult<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
very stiff and it can be difficult to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.580 
very stiff and it can be difficult to
pull<00:01:58.079> off<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:59.549> does<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> stiff

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
pull off it does come out we do it stiff

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
pull off it does come out we do it stiff
on<00:02:01.770> purpose<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.640> don't<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> pop<00:02:03.299> off

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
on purpose we don't want it to pop off

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.359 
on purpose we don't want it to pop off
accidentally<00:02:04.320> while<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> divers<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
accidentally while the divers in the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.150 
accidentally while the divers in the
water<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.969> there's<00:02:06.689> also<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.350> adjusting

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
water and there's also two adjusting

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
water and there's also two adjusting
points<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.119> side<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.410> people

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
points on the side here so if people

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
points on the side here so if people
want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.890> tighten<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.280> all<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> way<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
want to tighten it all the way up so it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.699 
want to tighten it all the way up so it
doesn't<00:02:12.390> come<00:02:12.540> off<00:02:12.569> they<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.080> do<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
doesn't come off they can do so

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.740 
doesn't come off they can do so
or<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.280> also<00:02:14.459> back<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.000> off<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> bit<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.599> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
or they can also back it off a bit so it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
or they can also back it off a bit so it
is<00:02:15.780> slightly<00:02:16.230> easier<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:17.400> dusted<00:02:17.879> out<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
is slightly easier this dusted out a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.720 
is slightly easier this dusted out a
little<00:02:18.269> further<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.950> low<00:02:20.129> pressure<00:02:20.370> hose

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
little further the the low pressure hose

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.610 
little further the the low pressure hose
has<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.239> be<00:02:21.359> about<00:02:21.599> an<00:02:21.780> inch<00:02:21.900> inch<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.469> a<00:02:22.590> half

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
has to be about an inch inch and a half

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.520 
has to be about an inch inch and a half
longer<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.939> make<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.329> work<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:25.049> does<00:02:25.290> not

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
longer to make this work it does not

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.009 
longer to make this work it does not
interfere<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.219> taller<00:02:27.000> cylinders<00:02:27.629> in<00:02:27.780> fact

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
interfere with taller cylinders in fact

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.379 
interfere with taller cylinders in fact
it<00:02:28.170> almost<00:02:28.409> it's<00:02:28.680> better<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:29.969> can<00:02:30.120> put

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
it almost it's better so you can put

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.649 
it almost it's better so you can put
higher<00:02:31.079> cylinders<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.739> yes<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:33.060> nineteen

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
higher cylinders here yes so nineteen

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.679 
higher cylinders here yes so nineteen
low-pressure<00:02:34.409> 14s<00:02:35.159> 13<00:02:35.579> they<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.180> work<00:02:36.420> nicely

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
low-pressure 14s 13 they all work nicely

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.819 
low-pressure 14s 13 they all work nicely
on<00:02:37.139> this<00:02:37.530> system<00:02:38.090> now<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> notice<00:02:39.569> my<00:02:40.319> favorite

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
on this system now I notice my favorite

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.640 
on this system now I notice my favorite
change<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.489> if<00:02:42.329> we<00:02:42.540> now<00:02:42.719> have<00:02:42.959> greater<00:02:43.379> access

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
change is if we now have greater access

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.129 
change is if we now have greater access
to<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.219> counter<00:02:44.609> lungs<00:02:44.849> in<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.299> yes<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:45.780> do

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
to the counter lungs in here yes we do

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.899 
to the counter lungs in here yes we do
tell<00:02:46.260> me<00:02:46.409> what<00:02:46.560> did<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.519> lot<00:02:47.579> of<00:02:47.639> calls

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
tell me what did you get a lot of calls

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.210 
tell me what did you get a lot of calls
about<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.359> we<00:02:49.139> did<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.859> perfectly

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
about that we did and to be perfectly

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.640 
about that we did and to be perfectly

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
classic kiss was number six or five or

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.599 
classic kiss was number six or five or
something<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.829> that<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.430> little

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
something like that it was this little

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.309 
something like that it was this little
mini<00:02:56.909> thing<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.599> I<00:02:57.689> really<00:02:57.900> never<00:02:58.109> had<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
mini thing and I really never had a

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.659 
mini thing and I really never had a
problem<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.889> lungs<00:02:59.099> but<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.489> drove

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
problem with the lungs but then I drove

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.429 
problem with the lungs but then I drove
a<00:02:59.819> sport<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.359> while<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.260> when<00:03:01.409> I

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
a sport for a while and then when I

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.379 
a sport for a while and then when I
started<00:03:01.799> cave<00:03:02.040> diving<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.730> went<00:03:03.000> back<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
started cave diving I went back to a

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.659 
started cave diving I went back to a
classic<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.349> set<00:03:04.799> up<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.950> new<00:03:05.099> classic<00:03:05.519> for

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
classic so I set up a new classic for

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.610 
classic so I set up a new classic for
myself<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.419> was<00:03:06.629> challenged<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.260> doing<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
myself and I was challenged in doing the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.309 
myself and I was challenged in doing the
lungs<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.549> figure<00:03:08.909> I'm<00:03:09.510> an<00:03:09.750> average<00:03:09.930> diver

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
lungs and I figure I'm an average diver

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.709 
lungs and I figure I'm an average diver
and<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.159> don't<00:03:11.219> like<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.790> my<00:03:12.209> customers

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
and if I don't like it my customers

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.500 
and if I don't like it my customers
won't<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.139> it<00:03:13.169> so<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.799> immediately<00:03:14.299> had<00:03:15.299> one

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
won't like it so I immediately had one

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.030 
won't like it so I immediately had one
of<00:03:15.629> my<00:03:15.719> Tech's<00:03:16.019> drill<00:03:16.319> holes<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.769> my<00:03:16.889> new

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
of my Tech's drill holes in my new

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.439 
of my Tech's drill holes in my new
counterlung<00:03:17.519> case<00:03:17.699> and<00:03:17.909> I<00:03:17.970> don't<00:03:18.030> what<00:03:18.269> for

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
counterlung case and I don't what for

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.059 
counterlung case and I don't what for
long<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.720> thought<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.079> works<00:03:19.319> really<00:03:19.500> well<00:03:19.769> so

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
long I thought this works really well so

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.250 
long I thought this works really well so
in<00:03:20.549> our<00:03:20.579> next<00:03:20.760> batch<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.060> cases<00:03:21.690> we<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:22.049> have

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
in our next batch of cases we now have

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.619 
in our next batch of cases we now have
had<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.590> machine<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.790> between<00:03:24.359> our
