 secretary of the faculty and all 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.860
 here present 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.150
 first of all we want to tell you that 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.530
 We are aware of the amount of 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.750
 emotions and feelings that we have in 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.340
 front and the first thing we want to do 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.080
 it's really to thank you 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.660
 presence because here too there is a 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.130
 lots of kilometers and the people that 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.580
 it comes from far away we really appreciate it 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.650
 very much about us we do not 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.960
 confuse that we do not confuse today 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.040
 it is said that we are the best generation of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 the story the most prepared generation 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.510
 but we are simply the generation with 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.190
 more titles in the history of agreement 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.810
 those are papers do not show 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.270
 knowledge that we 're going to have to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.430
 do us if we really aspire to 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.020
 form free citizens and if we aspire 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.840
 really to form critical citizens 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.240
 we have to inculcate concerns not worth 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.369
 with inculcating only concepts because 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.950
 Youth has to create youth 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.070
 he has to devise a youth that does not believe 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
 it is an anomaly today besides being a day 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.759
 of celebration is also a day of 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.009
 reflection and today surely we are 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.810
 asking what we have learned and what 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.060
 you have taught us 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.100
 because we have learned to build and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.350
 build in a very different way to 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.539
 as we did a decade ago we were 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.100
 invited a reality that has exploded and 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.140
 now it is the youth that creates and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.789
 bet on the alternative see you 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.259
 forced to undertake then the only 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.990
 Open doors that we have not found 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.479
 are those of the airport but it is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.950
 which has even said that the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.780
 Spanish youth is going away 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.239
 because we have an adventurous spirit of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.680
 that nothing to have adventurous spirit is 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.900
 get in the secretary's queue at 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.299
 times of registration you do not know what that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.280
 adventurous spirit that gives you time to 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.260
 take the notes in a class now 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.780
 no no no no no 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 to have an adventurous spirit is to write in 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.980
 our desks without you falling 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.900
 the bolis 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.060
 in series is the person who designed 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.810
 the jupiter of the faculty because mind 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.790
 perverse says that having a have a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.769
 adventurous spirit is to put yourself in 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.769
 first row in a white rose class 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.750
 that speaks very loose the woman does not have 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.299
 adventurous spirit is typing with the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.400
 mouth and if you have to paint with your mouth it 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.840
 lives tea because youth we 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.360
 we adapt to the circumstances we 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.579
 we adapt to adversities part of the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.440
 youth shows it every day with its 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.690
 sensitivity to injustice and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.940
 our nonconformist spirit that makes 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.739
 that we do not give up has never come 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.840
 to say that work in the European Union 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.120
 it's not working abroad for extra 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.970
 they say that working in europe is like 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.340
 work at home good sure that the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.780
 food will not taste the same good either 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.989
 quejes you can always try it 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.269
 total sundays come from berlin which is a 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.160
 closeness 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.140
 but besides adapting we have 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.329
 learned to participate or at least to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.420
 want to participate in what we are left 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.739
 yesterday we were informed that it is going to 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.470
 eliminate the advice of youth from 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.080
 Spain and this together with the reform 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.850
 of the educational law 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.590
 this makes us think that the only thing 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.300
 positive that has this is that if of 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.910
 this room is some future minister 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.500
 minister will at least have learned that if 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.670
 mark them the frame if we are not 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.220
 changes the legislative framework to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.140
 young at least at least we would like 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.990
 to be consulted 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.760
 Teachers will also come out of this room 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.800
 we who are teachers will do it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.990
 having learned to differentiate what 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.910
 is education education with capital letters 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.770
 and we will never confuse the fact of 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.990
 teach a class with what is to educate 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.150
 a good example have been our 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.400
 sponsors who have surpassed their role as 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.110
 teacher to become figures to 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.910
 which we aspire in some day 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.590
 Thank you for your passion your 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.750
 trust and affection that you have 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.850
 shown by us 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.410
 the same passion shown by the 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.750
 professors who teach from the vocation 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.670
 you are the ones that truly leave us 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.620
 good footprints those that leave us traces 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.150
 and those who gave us excuses and 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.500
 now at home no longer tired on twitter 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 I do marketing practices 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.070
 this degree has been a period 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.449
 short in year but intense in moments 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.160
 moments in which that company 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.650
 becomes the best support that can be 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.510
 have and that enliven our days as 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.160
 put up with the power out of nine 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.050
 at night if it's not for the company 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.760
 who would not want to be in a 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.529
 of our letters or doing our 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.989
 own beer 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:55.059
 We did not come here to be friends with everything 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:57.099
 the world the important thing is that we 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:59.709
 we take a handful of people who 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.689
 will be more than fellow people who do not 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:04.179
 we will never forget and they have a lot to 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.159
 say still in our lives too 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.349
 we have learned to value humility and 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.029
 the love because our family have 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.729
 invested and bet on our 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.409
 training thank you for supporting our 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.929
 times of study and have always 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:19.359
 words of support you know of very good 

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:21.429
 hand the fight delivers the sacrifices 

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:23.559
 and all the emotions that we have 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:25.389
 gone and we believe that the best 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.399
 opportunity to thank you all that 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.999
 you have done for us is now and 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:33.279
 from here thanks our successes as 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:35.190
 sons and daughters are yours as 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.110
 fathers and mothers 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.430
 we want to remember today also 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.950
 our human nutrition partners 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.210
 and dietetics that could not be here 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.740
 in a world where food has 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.720
 ceased to be a right for 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.860
 become a business the technologists 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.440
 food and dieticians 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.210
 nutritionists we have a lot to say 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.970
 in the end the most positive thing that we get from 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.340
 this is learning that not everything 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.870
 It's worth as the song says that our 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.550
 Delegate has chosen for the video 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.250
 we can choose what we want 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.230
 be then now depends on 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.120
 this day of ourselves that is 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.920
 social crisis this economic crisis this 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.220
 political crisis does not turn into a 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.780
 crisis of values ​​is worth not ending with 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.310
 our ethics that does not end with our 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.800
 moral not with that of our university 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.110
 not with our families 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.690
 we may leave here without remembering 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.699
 everything will in fact be the safest but 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.860
 overcome every obstacle has not done 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.259
 better not better than other people 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.300
 that is not the goal but to try to be 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.500
 the best versions of ourselves 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.500
