00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.870
 this is the week of the crumbs for Salerno's precarious workers 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.990
 given an appointment in front of the provincial school office to protest 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.400
 against the cuts wanted by the Berlusconi government by tremonti from the gelmini has 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.019
 from brunette two worlds divided by a fence 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.380
 on the one hand my school hires line up for the appointment 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.279
 much coveted on the other side just a few meters from the parent board 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 precarious the usual cobas to represent the bad state of mind of the class 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.749
 precarious teacher 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.030
 in a few days there will be the appointment of the few 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.080
 annual substitutes the usual crumbs is one thing 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.070
 but we say that the result of 10 years of visual policies 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.449
 identity politics we are raltek made towards the public school 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.539
 we are collecting what has been done in 10 years for this government 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.179
 ok area of ​​course for leaning on what was done by previous 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.949
 government continues with italy hey with the decree 112 seems to have arrived 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.950
 qualify from the fund because it matches other classes of and other classes 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 combining classes for example those in small 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.650
 it is the real winner merging class by increasing to numbers that number of students 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.880
 by class eeeee converting teachers and losers back to others 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 therefore it is an emergency because you say to me social emergence pt 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 multiply this year will not work and they will disappear black those of ed 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.670
 having dogs will become unemployed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.820
 and it is also an emergency of the indigenous years in which to sleep hoping 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.939
 in your and secretaries will have to move sent every year on classes 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.430
 different even changing matter 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 what it means that in addition to the denial of rights there is also the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.360
 denial 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.400
 in the study because the students will also be penalized will be a school of 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.360
 bad quality is better than parents and students 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.020
 realize that this school as you wish 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.520
 no more illiteracy by bringing forward can no longer produce ignorance 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 return we say that it is a class particularly raised that one 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.490
 there support 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.260
 many children will not be forced to beg for a few hours 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.870
 support 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.430
 support is easier than caianello 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.360
 and that in the end when it is necessary to return to the numbers as I said before the school 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.280
 dna decides to cut 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.150
 hellas costatina from 11 thousand places and then you can not understand yourself becomes 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 impossible because once increase the number of pupils per class at fault 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.759
 of the classes eliminated the hours 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.519
 the simplest thing is not able to cut 11 thousand seats 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.649
 and to fit into these numbers and cut back the support 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:48.959
 however for student support or link as cobas we have always supported i 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.699
 parents also through the recursionists we won by doing 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.630
 referring exclusively to the law 104 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.220
 the law 104 is still in force the tarlo gives us right the pupils' archives 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.840
 the disabled are entitled to the teacher for the hours necessary for their integration 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.730
 in school and that's why no news 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.800
 we take into account the financial numbers we take into account exclusively 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.730
 of the law 104 this is why then iannuzzo has decided to change also on 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.379
 support is obvious 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.680
 if a provincial school head raises his voice 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.989
 manages to get some extra seats 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.140
 is the provincial head teacher does not raise the tender voice to someone on 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:30.540
 chin 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.969
 but the problem is in one irene why 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.069
 seriously it would be the postman he would have adelina he would not have caserta not 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.100
 would have naples 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.979
 the problem is not to pull the blanket the problem I would give 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.090
 the shin guards serve 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.820
 the voice of the politicians of the province of Salerno is missing, as in other places 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.669
 if this is one thing it is hallucinating but not of any political color 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:54.690
 we felt 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.109
 a voice I mean 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.189
 head and on our side we also have senators thought of 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.169
 last year's wonders you came out read on of parliamentary questions 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.019
 strong against cuts and support this year happens not to be heard 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.149
 then we ask 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:16.319
 I want to tell all these politicians to take a stand are on the side 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.679
 of the people are on the side of the citizens 8 hours of flight and they and 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.490
 far from reality, therefore, coming down to the field with us is yes 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.150
 the lack of a councilor at the Easter school is also felt 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.789
 Stanzione 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.050
 when to give see we are only there when we go to the province 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.979
 difficult to get him off the 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.400
 from the palace then 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.199
 the important thing is that they take Manhattan position - even respect 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.000
 to the territorial organs of the public education ministry because the doctors 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.950
 that I'm not really that he is not responsible let him too ... 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.820
 why not take a stand 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.440
 at present you suck on the issue of such why not say publicly myself 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.200
 I can no longer manage this school some administrator must be done for 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.140
 always that of Messina and that of Catania and if the Republic Sheriff - 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.850
 translated as things are and instead of when to give unfortunately 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.430
 I probably think I don't even work to say that 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.469
 hotel of the Salerno school
