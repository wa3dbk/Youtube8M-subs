very important especially aggression and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.830 
very important especially aggression and
interceptions<00:00:57.470> which<00:00:57.620> are<00:00:57.800> very<00:00:58.010> very<00:00:58.340> high

interceptions which are very very high
shooting<00:00:59.840> isn't<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.320> great<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:01.070> is<00:01:01.310> not

what<00:01:02.330> you're<00:01:02.570> there<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.870> do<00:01:03.430> physical<00:01:04.430> is<00:01:04.640> very

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
what you're there to do physical is very

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.810 
what you're there to do physical is very
well-rounded<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.860> passing<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:06.950> very<00:01:07.340> very

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
well-rounded and passing is very very

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.849 
well-rounded and passing is very very
good<00:01:08.090> considering<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.409> are<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.710> that's

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
good considering what you are and that's

good considering what you are and that's
ball<00:01:10.130> winner<00:01:10.399> right<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.570> first<00:01:11.810> one<00:01:11.990> is

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
ball winner right so the first one is

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.319 
ball winner right so the first one is
standing<00:01:12.859> tackling<00:01:13.280> because<00:01:14.179> you're

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
standing tackling because you're

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:15.849 
standing tackling because you're
standing<00:01:14.659> tackling<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:15.320> high<00:01:15.530> you've<00:01:15.770> got

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
standing tackling is so high you've got

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.139 
standing tackling is so high you've got
such<00:01:16.039> big<00:01:16.249> radius<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:16.670> get<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:16.850> standing

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
such big radius to get the standing

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.690 
such big radius to get the standing
tackle<00:01:17.329> also<00:01:18.289> because<00:01:18.530> you're<00:01:18.829> as<00:01:19.189> light<00:01:19.549> as

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
tackle also because you're as light as

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.370 
tackle also because you're as light as
possible<00:01:19.759> you've<00:01:20.359> got<00:01:20.600> as<00:01:20.749> much<00:01:20.960> acceleration

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
possible you've got as much acceleration

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.700 
possible you've got as much acceleration
as<00:01:21.859> possible<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.969> you<00:01:22.999> can<00:01:23.240> quickly<00:01:24.049> get<00:01:24.380> your

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
as possible so you can quickly get your

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.230 
as possible so you can quickly get your
foot<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.130> ball<00:01:25.369> very<00:01:25.520> quickly<00:01:25.819> to<00:01:25.969> get

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
foot to the ball very quickly to get

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.359 
foot to the ball very quickly to get
this<00:01:26.390> standing<00:01:26.780> tackle<00:01:26.929> also<00:01:27.859> because<00:01:28.189> you're

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
this standing tackle also because you're

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.399 
this standing tackle also because you're
ready<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.729> surf<00:01:28.939> I<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.749> can<00:01:29.899> literally<00:01:30.170> just

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
ready to surf I you can literally just

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.989 
ready to surf I you can literally just
cover<00:01:30.859> them<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.249> let<00:01:31.340> them<00:01:31.369> come<00:01:31.609> into<00:01:31.850> you

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
cover them and let them come into you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.370 
cover them and let them come into you
because<00:01:32.329> you've<00:01:32.659> got<00:01:32.719> such<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:32.960> big<00:01:33.140> radius

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
because you've got such a big radius

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.020 
because you've got such a big radius
they're<00:01:33.979> going<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.219> probably<00:01:34.490> google<00:01:34.850> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
they're going to probably google the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.940 
they're going to probably google the
ball<00:01:35.240> into<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:35.659> radius<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.679> can<00:01:36.829> just

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
ball into that radius and you can just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.440 
ball into that radius and you can just
get<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.189> tackle<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.759> another<00:01:38.060> good<00:01:38.420> thing

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
get the tackle to another good thing

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.770 
get the tackle to another good thing
about<00:01:38.810> having<00:01:39.409> high<00:01:39.770> defensive<00:01:40.369> tackling<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
about having high defensive tackling the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.889 
about having high defensive tackling the
attributes<00:01:42.350> are<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.189> higher<00:01:43.399> they<00:01:43.670> are<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
attributes are the higher they are the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.840 
attributes are the higher they are the
less<00:01:44.899> likely<00:01:45.109> you<00:01:45.350> are<00:01:45.469> to<00:01:45.590> foul<00:01:45.950> them<00:01:46.189> valve

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
less likely you are to foul them valve

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.559 
less likely you are to foul them valve
other<00:01:47.240> players<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:48.639> you<00:01:49.639> won't<00:01:49.819> get<00:01:50.060> booked<00:01:50.359> as

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
other players so you won't get booked as

other players so you won't get booked as
much<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.229> won't<00:01:51.409> concede<00:01:51.770> fouls<00:01:52.039> as<00:01:52.310> much

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
much and you won't concede fouls as much

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.969 
much and you won't concede fouls as much
at<00:01:53.270> five<00:01:53.479> foot<00:01:53.719> ten<00:01:53.990> you're<00:01:54.200> also<00:01:54.289> still<00:01:54.799> quick

at five foot ten you're also still quick

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.919 
at five foot ten you're also still quick
enough<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.280> intercept<00:01:55.670> passes<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.450> you're

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
enough to intercept passes and you're

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.649 
enough to intercept passes and you're
still<00:01:57.109> quick<00:01:57.350> enough<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:58.369> players<00:01:59.240> can't

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
still quick enough that players can't

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.719 
still quick enough that players can't
just<00:01:59.899> outpace<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:00.679> at<00:02:00.950> five<00:02:01.249> or<00:02:01.429> ten<00:02:01.579> you're

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
just outpace you at five or ten you're

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.160 
just outpace you at five or ten you're
strong<00:02:01.939> enough<00:02:01.969> as<00:02:02.299> well<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.689> no<00:02:02.899> one<00:02:03.020> just

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
strong enough as well so no one just

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.989 
strong enough as well so no one just
runs<00:02:03.439> straight<00:02:03.799> past<00:02:04.069> you<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.490> get<00:02:04.579> your<00:02:04.850> ball

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
runs straight past you can get your ball

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.389 
runs straight past you can get your ball
before<00:02:05.149> they<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:05.950> because<00:02:06.950> you've<00:02:07.249> got

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
before they can and because you've got

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.969 
before they can and because you've got
high<00:02:07.670> acceleration<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:08.630> get

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
high acceleration you can get

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.859 
high acceleration you can get
goes<00:02:09.190> off<00:02:09.340> quite<00:02:09.580> easily<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> sprint

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
goes off quite easily with the sprint

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.899 
goes off quite easily with the sprint
speed<00:02:11.080> as<00:02:11.260> well<00:02:11.409> and<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.099> reason<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:12.610> five

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
speed as well and the reason it's five

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.110 
speed as well and the reason it's five
foot<00:02:13.150> ten<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.650> height<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.220> just

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
foot ten is because the height is just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.119 
foot ten is because the height is just
good<00:02:16.330> enough<00:02:16.420> for<00:02:16.720> headers<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.920> still

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
good enough for headers and you still

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.860 
good enough for headers and you still
got<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> lot<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.580> speed<00:02:18.970> because<00:02:19.629> you're<00:02:19.750> going

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
got a lot of speed because you're going

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.270 
got a lot of speed because you're going
to<00:02:19.930> need<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.080> lot<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.260> speed<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:20.950> kind<00:02:21.190> of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
to need a lot of speed at this kind of

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.190 
to need a lot of speed at this kind of
position<00:02:21.640> because<00:02:22.000> most<00:02:22.420> forwards<00:02:22.959> are

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
position because most forwards are

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.339 
position because most forwards are
speedy<00:02:23.680> smaller<00:02:24.430> players<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.330> you're<00:02:25.959> slow

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
speedy smaller players so if you're slow

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.509 
speedy smaller players so if you're slow
you're<00:02:26.379> just<00:02:26.830> not<00:02:27.129> going<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.400> very

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
you're just not going to be very

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.550 
you're just not going to be very
effective<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.450> build<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.049> also<00:02:29.290> very<00:02:29.470> good

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
effective this build is also very good

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.979 
effective this build is also very good
at<00:02:29.709> dribbling<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:31.420> he's<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.690> quick

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
at dribbling and because he's so quick

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.020 
at dribbling and because he's so quick
and<00:02:32.440> he's<00:02:32.650> got<00:02:32.799> such<00:02:33.010> high<00:02:33.250> acceleration

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
and he's got such high acceleration

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.430 
and he's got such high acceleration
because<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.629> other<00:02:34.750> players<00:02:34.959> been<00:02:35.140> sprinting

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
because the other players been sprinting

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.229 
because the other players been sprinting
longer<00:02:35.860> you'll<00:02:36.010> have<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:36.670> jumper

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
longer you'll have that little jumper

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.960 
longer you'll have that little jumper
speed<00:02:37.540> at<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.810> beginning<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.010> you'll<00:02:39.549> most

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
speed at the beginning so you'll most

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.490 
speed at the beginning so you'll most
likely<00:02:40.090> be<00:02:40.420> able<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.690> catch<00:02:40.870> up<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.230> them<00:02:41.319> and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
likely be able to catch up to them and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.250 
likely be able to catch up to them and
an<00:02:42.010> intercept<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.489> ball<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.910> because<00:02:43.900> you're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
an intercept the ball and because you're

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.500 
an intercept the ball and because you're
so<00:02:44.410> fast<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.129> find<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.700> lot<00:02:45.849> more<00:02:45.879> easier<00:02:46.329> to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
so fast you find it a lot more easier to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.449 
so fast you find it a lot more easier to
intercept<00:02:46.900> passes<00:02:47.170> because<00:02:47.709> interception<00:02:48.340> to

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
intercept passes because interception to

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.369 
intercept passes because interception to
self<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.819> also<00:02:49.030> you'll<00:02:49.540> find<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.900> lot<00:02:49.989> easier<00:02:50.170> to

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
self I also you'll find a lot easier to

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.140 
self I also you'll find a lot easier to
inseparable<00:02:50.799> he'll<00:02:51.519> have<00:02:51.609> more<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.879> a<00:02:51.940> reach

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
inseparable he'll have more of a reach

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.869 
inseparable he'll have more of a reach
to<00:02:52.420> get<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> ball<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.079> he's<00:02:53.890> at<00:02:54.370> five<00:02:54.640> foot

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
to get the ball and he's at five foot

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.539 
to get the ball and he's at five foot
ten<00:02:55.090> he's<00:02:55.329> still<00:02:55.540> strong<00:02:55.840> enough<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.829> hold<00:02:57.340> off

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
ten he's still strong enough to hold off

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.580 
ten he's still strong enough to hold off
any<00:02:57.730> player<00:02:58.060> that's<00:02:58.329> trying<00:02:58.629> to<00:02:58.750> outmuscle

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
any player that's trying to outmuscle

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.400 
any player that's trying to outmuscle
him<00:03:00.030> also<00:03:01.030> what's<00:03:01.209> good<00:03:01.359> about<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.569> build<00:03:01.959> is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
him also what's good about this build is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.460 
him also what's good about this build is
that<00:03:03.010> because<00:03:03.310> you're<00:03:03.940> varying<00:03:04.599> you're<00:03:05.260> being

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
that because you're varying you're being

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.839 
that because you're varying you're being
very<00:03:05.650> annoying<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.190> other<00:03:06.310> team<00:03:06.549> keep

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
very annoying the other team keep

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.180 
very annoying the other team keep
constantly<00:03:07.599> tackling<00:03:08.049> them<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.290> stopping

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
constantly tackling them and stopping

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.949 
constantly tackling them and stopping
their<00:03:09.459> play<00:03:09.670> they'll<00:03:10.359> get<00:03:10.510> very<00:03:10.750> frustrated

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
their play they'll get very frustrated

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.960 
their play they'll get very frustrated
with<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.709> which<00:03:11.859> is<00:03:12.010> obviously<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.519> good<00:03:12.730> thing

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
with you which is obviously a good thing

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.460 
with you which is obviously a good thing
because<00:03:13.180> they'll<00:03:13.450> start<00:03:13.750> trying<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.019> foul<00:03:14.260> you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
because they'll start trying to foul you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.199 
because they'll start trying to foul you
at<00:03:14.980> flat<00:03:15.220> foot<00:03:15.400> turn<00:03:15.639> your<00:03:15.790> players<00:03:16.000> still

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
at flat foot turn your players still

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.150 
at flat foot turn your players still
strong<00:03:16.480> enough<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.720> win<00:03:17.109> headers<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.739> tall

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
strong enough to win headers and tall

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.339 
strong enough to win headers and tall
enough<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.519> win<00:03:18.639> headers<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.349> hopefully

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
enough to win headers and hopefully

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.990 
enough to win headers and hopefully
you've<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.530> lot<00:03:20.560> power<00:03:20.980> heading<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:21.849> an

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
you've a lot power heading it's an

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.460 
you've a lot power heading it's an
extremely<00:03:22.419> good<00:03:22.660> trait<00:03:22.900> for<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.230> because<00:03:23.349> it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
extremely good trait for it because it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.259 
extremely good trait for it because it
just<00:03:23.620> doesn't<00:03:23.919> affect<00:03:24.340> your<00:03:24.609> heading<00:03:24.970> for

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
just doesn't affect your heading for

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.240 
just doesn't affect your heading for
shooting<00:03:25.540> on<00:03:25.660> goal<00:03:25.870> if<00:03:26.079> actually<00:03:26.919> all<00:03:27.069> your

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
shooting on goal if actually all your

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.670 
shooting on goal if actually all your
heading<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.609> general<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:29.260> will<00:03:29.349> help<00:03:29.560> you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
heading in general and it will help you

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.890 
heading in general and it will help you
increase<00:03:29.980> winning<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:30.970> headers<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.450> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
increase winning the headers so you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.449 
increase winning the headers so you
should<00:03:32.079> win<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.470> quite<00:03:32.650> fairly<00:03:32.950> lot<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
should win for quite fairly lot of

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.580 
should win for quite fairly lot of
headers<00:03:33.790> at<00:03:33.910> five<00:03:34.090> foot<00:03:34.299> ten<00:03:34.540> slide<00:03:35.049> tackling

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
headers at five foot ten slide tackling

headers at five foot ten slide tackling
this<00:03:35.980> build<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.459> very<00:03:36.760> good<00:03:36.819> slide<00:03:37.180> tackling

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
this build is a very good slide tackling

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.539 
this build is a very good slide tackling
build<00:03:37.900> got<00:03:38.290> such<00:03:38.470> high<00:03:38.650> slide<00:03:38.950> tackling<00:03:39.400> with

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
build got such high slide tackling with

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.610 
build got such high slide tackling with
aggression<00:03:39.849> plus<00:03:40.389> your<00:03:40.630> height<00:03:40.840> plus<00:03:41.139> speed

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
aggression plus your height plus speed

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.379 
aggression plus your height plus speed
means<00:03:41.919> you<00:03:42.099> can<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.400> lot<00:03:42.639> of<00:03:42.700> slide<00:03:42.970> tackling

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
means you can do a lot of slide tackling

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.750 
means you can do a lot of slide tackling
plus<00:03:43.810> with<00:03:44.200> slide<00:03:44.769> tackling<00:03:45.160> actually<00:03:45.519> being

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
plus with slide tackling actually being

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.809 
plus with slide tackling actually being
so<00:03:45.940> high<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.810> get<00:03:47.109> more<00:03:47.560> odds<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.250> completing

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
so high you get more odds of completing

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.670 
so high you get more odds of completing
your<00:03:48.849> slide<00:03:49.150> tackles<00:03:49.599> also<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.049> slide<00:03:50.319> tackling

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
your slide tackles also a slide tackling

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.110 
your slide tackles also a slide tackling
because<00:03:50.859> your<00:03:50.980> aggression<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.579> high<00:03:51.790> you're

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
because your aggression so high you're

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.670 
because your aggression so high you're
more<00:03:52.269> aggressive<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.870> get<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.109> slide<00:03:53.319> tackle

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
more aggressive to get the slide tackle

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.259 
more aggressive to get the slide tackle
off<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.010> you're<00:03:54.129> less<00:03:54.340> likely<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.760> fail<00:03:55.030> them

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
off so you're less likely to fail them

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.390 
off so you're less likely to fail them
and<00:03:55.450> also<00:03:56.109> if<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.500> do<00:03:56.680> fail<00:03:56.919> them<00:03:57.129> you're<00:03:57.280> less

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
and also if you do fail them you're less

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.190 
and also if you do fail them you're less
likely<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.760> get<00:03:57.940> bit<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.480> got<00:03:58.629> closer<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.989> the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
likely to get bit you got closer to the

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.629 
likely to get bit you got closer to the
ball<00:03:59.349> doesn't<00:03:59.769> mean<00:03:59.919> you<00:04:00.010> won't<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.430> booked

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
ball doesn't mean you won't get booked

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.640 
ball doesn't mean you won't get booked
but<00:04:00.849> you'll<00:04:01.030> get<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.599> lot<00:04:01.840> less<00:04:01.870> when

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
but you'll get but a lot less when

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.690 
but you'll get but a lot less when
you've<00:04:02.829> got<00:04:02.950> aggression<00:04:03.340> very<00:04:03.549> high

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
you've got aggression very high

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.430 
you've got aggression very high
especially<00:04:04.180> with<00:04:04.510> plier<00:04:04.810> tackling

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
especially with plier tackling

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.530 
especially with plier tackling
attributes<00:04:05.919> and<00:04:06.099> passing<00:04:06.910> wise<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.359> is<00:04:07.510> a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
attributes and passing wise this is a

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.300 
attributes and passing wise this is a
very<00:04:07.870> good<00:04:07.959> part<00:04:08.379> in<00:04:08.560> building<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:08.980> think<00:04:09.160> it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
very good part in building and think it

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.759 
very good part in building and think it
would<00:04:09.459> be<00:04:09.609> a<00:04:09.639> start<00:04:10.030> but<00:04:10.720> it's<00:04:11.019> nearly<00:04:11.349> as<00:04:11.560> good

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
would be a start but it's nearly as good

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.570 
would be a start but it's nearly as good
as<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.069> playmaker<00:04:12.430> attacking<00:04:13.389> me

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
as a playmaker attacking me

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.509 
as a playmaker attacking me
builder<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:14.570> a<00:04:14.690> very<00:04:14.960> good<00:04:15.050> passer<00:04:15.519> overall

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
builder it's a very good passer overall

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.280 
builder it's a very good passer overall
this<00:04:16.640> is<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.850> very<00:04:17.269> good<00:04:17.390> build<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:17.930> didn't<00:04:18.140> think

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
this is a very good build I didn't think

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.380 
this is a very good build I didn't think
I'd<00:04:18.620> have<00:04:18.830> as<00:04:19.010> much<00:04:19.130> fun<00:04:19.640> as<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:19.910> did<00:04:19.940> with<00:04:20.269> this

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
I'd have as much fun as I did with this

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.570 
I'd have as much fun as I did with this
build<00:04:20.660> but<00:04:21.140> this<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.410> really<00:04:21.890> fun<00:04:22.130> build<00:04:22.400> I

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
build but this is a really fun build I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.030 
build but this is a really fun build I
think<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.850> use<00:04:23.000> it<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.210> lot<00:04:23.420> passing<00:04:24.050> YZ<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.890> an

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
think I use it a lot passing YZ a is an

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.190 
think I use it a lot passing YZ a is an
extremely<00:04:25.490> good<00:04:25.730> pass<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.330> long<00:04:26.720> passing

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
extremely good pass that long passing

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.930 
extremely good pass that long passing
and<00:04:27.350> short<00:04:27.620> passing<00:04:28.040> he's<00:04:28.340> also<00:04:28.520> an<00:04:28.730> extremely

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
and short passing he's also an extremely

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.360 
and short passing he's also an extremely
good<00:04:29.360> dribbler<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.010> which<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.100> wasn't

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
good dribbler and which I wasn't

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.730 
good dribbler and which I wasn't
expecting<00:04:31.550> at<00:04:31.940> all<00:04:32.120> but<00:04:32.450> it's<00:04:33.140> builded<00:04:33.500> very

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
expecting at all but it's builded very

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.880 
expecting at all but it's builded very
good<00:04:33.890> dribbling<00:04:34.190> build<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.530> he's<00:04:36.530> got<00:04:36.710> such

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
good dribbling build and he's got such

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.290 
good dribbling build and he's got such
high<00:04:37.070> ball<00:04:37.340> control<00:04:37.730> when<00:04:37.910> he's<00:04:38.030> got<00:04:38.120> quite

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
high ball control when he's got quite

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.570 
high ball control when he's got quite
high<00:04:38.450> dribbling<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.530> can<00:04:39.710> still<00:04:39.890> do<00:04:40.160> quite

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
high dribbling so you can still do quite

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.070 
high dribbling so you can still do quite
a<00:04:40.610> fairly<00:04:41.150> decent<00:04:41.210> amount<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.720> dribbling

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
a fairly decent amount of dribbling

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.320 
a fairly decent amount of dribbling
shooting-wise<00:04:42.920> all<00:04:43.400> those<00:04:43.580> shooting<00:04:44.060> stats

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
shooting-wise all those shooting stats

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.710 
shooting-wise all those shooting stats
aren't<00:04:44.570> great<00:04:45.020> he<00:04:45.590> has<00:04:45.710> high<00:04:45.920> shot<00:04:46.220> pal<00:04:46.460> and

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
aren't great he has high shot pal and

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.480 
aren't great he has high shot pal and
the<00:04:47.720> accuracies<00:04:48.380> just<00:04:48.830> enough<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.430> should

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
the accuracies just enough you should

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.940 
the accuracies just enough you should
score<00:04:50.030> quite<00:04:50.300> quite<00:04:50.930> often<00:04:51.110> maybe<00:04:51.440> one<00:04:51.680> every

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
score quite quite often maybe one every

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.380 
score quite quite often maybe one every
two<00:04:52.130> games<00:04:52.430> if<00:04:52.700> you're<00:04:52.970> quite<00:04:53.210> good<00:04:53.240> at

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
two games if you're quite good at

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.270 
two games if you're quite good at
shooting<00:04:53.810> from<00:04:53.960> long<00:04:54.170> shots<00:04:54.440> yeah<00:04:54.860> I'll

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
shooting from long shots yeah I'll

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.470 
shooting from long shots yeah I'll
school<00:04:55.550> quite<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.850> lot<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.090> goals<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.390> this

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
school quite a lot of goals in this

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.910 
school quite a lot of goals in this
build<00:04:56.720> which<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:56.960> wasn't<00:04:57.140> expecting<00:04:57.410> at<00:04:57.770> all

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
build which I wasn't expecting at all

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.100 
build which I wasn't expecting at all
but<00:04:58.220> overall<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.210> just<00:04:59.330> an<00:04:59.420> extremely<00:04:59.990> good

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
but overall it's just an extremely good

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.200 
but overall it's just an extremely good
build<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:00.560> quite<00:05:00.800> balanced<00:05:01.490> overall<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.060> a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
build it's quite balanced overall it's a

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.970 
build it's quite balanced overall it's a
very<00:05:02.240> effective<00:05:02.810> build<00:05:03.260> out<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.680> all<00:05:03.860> the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
very effective build out of all the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.860
