00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so welcome back to minecraft beef 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.560
 today the fugger of the last round 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.160
 yes the racer rausgeschmissen hello hello 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.309
 and the new candidate is the 3 l play 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.690
 friday and today we play again 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.480
 The obstacles to the obstacle course 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.820
 the hurdles the swimmer today and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.260
 The rules are relatively simple 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.880
 the two candidates will be at the start 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 then ground on their states here 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 would then have to end as soon as possible 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 The track sprinting over diverse 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.989
 skip obstacles and there on 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.989
 the end of the track is one on each side 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.430
 Switches and candidates need to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.960
 switch but press the light 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.000
 that is almost a baton 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.950
 as soon as the switch of the depressed son 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.550
 there is the whole course again 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.170
 backwards and who will be the first one 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 Target area there behind behind the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.750
 enter has won and gets flag 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 the point or first three rounds 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.140
 So wins a maximum of five rounds there 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.719
 because the first round wins is the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 winner of the letter as far as that is 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.170
 actually the candidates are difficult 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 What a cap from meat 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 fall to hew they may also 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.619
 Not 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.939
 and if possible please open it as much as possible 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.960
 stay on your track and not the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.040
 line crossing 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.060
 that would be very cool yes there's still a question 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.060
 I think I'm actually right 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.050
 yes I say the consultant says that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.290
 start command 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.260
 All right off we go three three 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.170
 one and go 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.480
 All right, then with magic then by the way 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.510
 rather short of people 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.940
 leppin had stayed there so somewhere 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.090
 I think that was Richmond against back then 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.970
 delay and delay had the first two 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 won round because he has two zones 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.380
 leadership in leadership and has redmond three 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.140
 He has won races in a row 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:20.510
 but also carried the letter home 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:22.220
 so many problems so the 383 something the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.680
 Post switch hit you what I have 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.520
 it would not have died with me 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.140
 now the light must also be to his heart 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.400
 opened for prepayment full know 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:42.430
 Everything is clear 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.430
 The camera is missing in front 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.890
 I think I think the federal 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.959
 decided that a little brain it 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.840
 should not be so yes so I stay 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.850
 stuck there and then suddenly the tears 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.980
 back because the keyboard to sprit so 1.1 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.500
 go to the 3play then I ask you 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 I take your city lightning again 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.750
 believe does not do it for the first time 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:20.710
 Nobody has a clear idea here 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.710
 Let's start round 2 3 2 1 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.030
 this time even to come close 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.380
 but is free to hang on the first brain 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.180
 but that's how you love the last one 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.310
 wind times eric holland also suddenly 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.120
 three rounds in a row easy 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.860
 behaves so won 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.209
 you have to remember broken keyboard 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:48.620
 At the time it was not a joke 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.420
 he really had the broken keyboard 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.830
 Part of Europe is currently involved 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.830
 catch up a bit here shifts back 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.050
 now is the light again belongs 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.549
 be made out 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.700
 if I spend that again now 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.470
 light so I think 3 l is already with 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.090
 that's why copier printers are the target 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.450
 further back 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.450
 yes I have before we cycle 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.530
 cozy while klose I go 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.470
 let the lights go back by yourself 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.330
 Are you both in the same light? 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.390
 because instead of bird does not work 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.690
 abo pay it best that 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.220
 before that is tangible we both do 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.790
 Again, it does not matter to many 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.140
 so if you do not have to go now 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:54.580
 must be on if you turn around before you 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.710
 so three everything with two points in front 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.090
 you have to, now it's already over yes it 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.460
 is a bit exciting you have 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.760
 so grossly asserted in ours 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.770
 chat and skype how much the 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.979
 Racer simply become best 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.419
 I did that too 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:23.240
 yes, but you wanted to come here from 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:31.880
 highscore canceled including no 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:33.620
 problem yes no matter is, then we do 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.389
 but that's it 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.760
 so grows and wolf there 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.199
 which comes a few follow again are 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.970
 you ready for the eventual final 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:51.770
 round everything clear then we start in 3 2 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.600
 1 go so volker you have to, otherwise it is 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.010
 long gone 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.100
 Look the first time you make it 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.100
 progress yes that's all okay 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.580
 get stuck again at the end 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.000
 it is the last time a bit 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.020
 difficult there is a jump question 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.139
 I do not ask you now but the objection 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.090
 is a bit tricky if you are there because 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.650
 it obviously something to do though 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.280
 it is obvious that you are 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:26.120
 he does a good job until that happens 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.430
 explained because I already have the front 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.870
 now only the switch pressed so 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.039
 if nothing bigger happens now 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.100
 is then almost already 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.050
 decided 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.590
 yes it will probably be so feed is 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.590
 so far behind 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:53.060
 unity also reach the goal 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:55.190
 Trinity of Laufburg are 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:02.389
 has won is most likely 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:07.910
 wifo still delights quite well with his 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:10.550
 receptive to limit falling voted so 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.840
 in the speed hectare so what yes there wants 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.430
 I'm his heart the vig was the three 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.099
 Play the s100 again next time 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.199
 in the process against a new opponent 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.580
 I honestly do not know 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.750
 I still have a lot of applications 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.780
 I think next time will come again 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.070
 somehow user ratings because he 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.800
 has been some follow me no more 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.940
 so let me say thank you 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.889
 two for I join come over 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.949
 to you I do it once with the 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:39.110
 Compass is faster 

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:41.240
 so am very good you can be a 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.640
 Inventar shows me once in the face 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.319
 throw now laste the swr to you on 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.449
 the slums 

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:50.309
 very well, all right, well, there I would 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:51.870
 say thanks to feed for join in that 

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:54.199
 second time if you have a few 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:57.749
 like to follow again 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:59.520
 our new to vechta on the highscore 

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:01.110
 So it's the 3m play look 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.699
 someone again the lawn to the well 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.740
 ask is because then one's 

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:08.009
 Epic 3 will result as soon as the next one ever 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.099
 24 points reached 13 january 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:12.809
 will be pretty funny but let's see 

00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:15.559
 that's not so good, all right 

00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:18.559
 then see you next time at the beef and 

00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:18.559
 Books
