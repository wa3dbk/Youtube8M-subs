00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:01.809
 Hello! I am a company employee! 

00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:06.140
 Today's makeup is Instagram style! It is a makeup that got a bomb 

00:00:06.251 --> 00:00:08.180
 How nice! But there are 2400 ... 

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:10.740
 I just want to apply a red lip 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540
 I want to lose my bangs 

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:14.240
 So I just did makeup! 

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:15.760
 Very chest crunchy ... 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.040
 After discovering another one in the mirror 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.540
 Recently I always spend like this 

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:21.800
 Well, make go goshin! 

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.260
 I tried using the Lebron foundation that came to Korea for the first time this time 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.200
 I also like the sustainability and coverage 

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:30.260
 Foundations like double wear are also 

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:33.120
 Recommended for lipid skin but not for dry skin ... 

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:37.320
 Cover acne and redness under the nose with VDL concealer 

00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:41.000
 The company employee discovers something while painting ... 

00:00:41.394 --> 00:00:44.280
 I used that to get rid of it 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 You are now watching videos that defeat that 

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.500
 I've shaved it, so let's draw eyebrows 

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:54.120
 Draw a single eyebrow with a bright colored pencil as you always draw 

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:01.620
 When I put on my bangs, I wasn't doing bloom scalars because it was bothersome. 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.700
 I will lose my bangs today 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.220
 I also use broumascalar 

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:11.900
 After a long time, I used orange-colored teak 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.960
 I used Tony Molly's Crystal Teak # 14 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.960
 Use a small brush 

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:20.540
 From the part that floats up to cheekbones when laughing 

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:23.860
 At a higher position, I put it as an oblique point 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 Because the boundary was made a little 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 Lightly blended with a large soft brush 

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:32.260
 Insert a nose shadow from the end of the eyehole 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.880
 Shading of face line 

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:37.760
 The cheekbones were placed to be combined with the teak 

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:41.100
 Good highlight of coloring 

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:43.860
 When I put it in my nose and nose, chin ... 

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:46.440
 Sneezing ... 

00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:49.380
 The highlight is a bit of natural highlights 

00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:52.200
 I was on the edge of the teak to blur 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 It is a paint pat I like very much 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.580
 I have about seven 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.560
 The color I used today is parky 

00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.940
 This contains apricot-colored fine pearls 

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.640
 I will put on the entire eye as an eye shadow base 

00:02:05.534 --> 00:02:08.420
 Mix and use two orange-colored shadows 

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:11.260
 One was my video several times 

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:14.120
 Emoda's eyebrow base with orange color 

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:16.800
 We mix and use nature republic eye shadow 

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:20.240
 From this part where the eyelids have jumped out most 

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.420
 I will spread widely to the front 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.160
 Be bold under the eyebrows! 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.800
 I wanted to add a little more orange 

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:33.700
 Emoda only stacked in the center 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
 Everybody has a color shadow that one has 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.680
 I will paint it on the side not painted orange 

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:43.280
 I connected to the under and put it widely 

00:02:49.597 --> 00:02:51.254
 The buckwheat of the national shadow 

00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:54.840
 Starting from the eyes, put a bit on the eyeliner 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060
 The remaining part is put under 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.340
 I put the gray shade of Espua on half of the eyelids 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.580
 This will also be connected to the under 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.760
 I prepared the outside of the eye shadow with a brush with nothing 

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.600
 This is a recommended item bought in Japan! 

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:22.060
 Vise's pencil eyeliner 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.980
 Very very thin 

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:27.560
 And it's super waterproof! 

00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.500
 It's so thin that even if you don't scratch it with your nails 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.400
 You can sharpen your eyes. 

00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:37.540
 While watching the video ... let's be beautiful ... 

00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:44.320
 If you look at this video ... makeup will be fine ... 

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:54.900
 I want to show this video to people around ... 

00:03:55.303 --> 00:03:57.920
 As many times as I showed ... 

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:05.380
 I do not know the reason ... I attract beauty ... 

00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:08.474
 I am very ... happy ... 

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:11.240
 We put gray away on eye line 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.560
 As we leave sharp line this time as it is 

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:16.820
 Overlap on the eyeline, not just blending 

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:22.100
 I do a burer and do mascara with interdental brush today 

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.057
 I use eyelashes after a long time 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.620
 Use DUP 927 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.440
 It is a natural type with a slightly long aim 

00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:37.520
 Fill the mucous membrane with Etude's 08th skin-colored liner as usual 

00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:43.077
 I would like to use today a color I bought and never used! 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 I will put it on the mucous membrane of my eyes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.200
 I will put the gold in the center of the mucous membrane 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.729
 I placed makeup forever diamond powder on my eyes 

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.740
 It looks like silver but it's gold when painted 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.626
 Makeup Forever Star Powder Green 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.834
 More than the part where diamond powder was loaded earlier 

00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:06.100
 I will put in a slightly narrower area 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.960
 This is like a cooking source, like a magical source that won't even teach your wife 

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:13.040
 If you give a shot of green powder 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.960
 Gold looks more yellowish 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.580
 Lip used what was received from fans in beauty in me class 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.420
 The color name seems to be this 

00:05:22.514 --> 00:05:25.400
 Apply properly to the entire lip 

00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:28.400
 I will prepare a lip line with a cotton swab 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.660
 And I will lay it over again 

00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:37.080
 On top of that, I piled up the yellow gloss I bought at Emoda. 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.000
 Ah ~ ~ I like this color! ! 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.600
 Thus the makeup is complete! 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.400
 The atmosphere is slightly different from the usual sparkling makeup 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.180
 I also like this 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.080
 It's hot these days, so I'm spending it like this with no bangs 

00:06:00.103 --> 00:06:02.660
 I also do Instagram, so please come and see me in my spare time! 

00:06:03.106 --> 00:06:05.120
 See you next video! 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.240
 Vine ~ ~!
