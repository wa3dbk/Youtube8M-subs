stab like this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.999 
stab like this
like<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.229> see<00:02:03.439> with<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> normal

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009

grip that's without my reach a reverse

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.570 
grip that's without my reach a reverse
grip<00:02:06.859> there's<00:02:07.850> pretty<00:02:08.119> similar<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.580> actually

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
grip there's pretty similar but actually

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.000 
grip there's pretty similar but actually
that<00:02:10.930> far<00:02:11.930> off<00:02:13.269> you've<00:02:14.269> got<00:02:14.420> /<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.530> again<00:02:15.709> an

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
that far off you've got / and again an

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.770 
that far off you've got / and again an

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.070 
advantage of concealed weapon the other
group<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.560> other<00:02:21.920> reverse<00:02:22.250> grip<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.989> when<00:02:23.989> I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
group the other reverse grip is when I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.330 
group the other reverse grip is when I

still pointing down but the delayed

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.729 
still pointing down but the delayed
rotated<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> opposite<00:02:26.360> direction<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.620> the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
rotated the opposite direction so the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.910 
rotated the opposite direction so the
blade<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.250> against<00:02:29.080> before<00:02:30.080> him<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.709> need<00:02:30.860> to
