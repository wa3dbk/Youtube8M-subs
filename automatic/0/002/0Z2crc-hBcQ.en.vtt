00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.280 
see I'm pulling up I'm pulling pretty
hard<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:10.260> just

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
hard and you're just you're just

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
hard and you're just you're just
stretching<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:12.060> all<00:01:12.240> you're

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
stretching it out that's all you're

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.429 
stretching it out that's all you're
really<00:01:12.450> doing<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.840> when<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> tune<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> up

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
really doing so that when you tune it up

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
really doing so that when you tune it up
to<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> low<00:01:17.009> E<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> stay<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.330> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
to a low E it's going to stay there it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.249 
to a low E it's going to stay there it's
not<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:21.080> sink<00:01:22.080> on

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
not going to it's not going to sink on

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.539 
not going to it's not going to sink on
you<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> already<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.509> tone<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.369> pitch

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you so already the tone that the pitch

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.440 
you so already the tone that the pitch
of<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> lot<00:01:27.960> lower

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
of that is is a lot lower

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.550 
of that is is a lot lower
I<00:01:29.829> think<00:01:30.829> this<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.250> still<00:01:31.700> an<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.180> down<00:01:32.600> here

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.930 

now<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:38.920> all<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.250> important<00:01:39.730> to<00:01:39.820> get

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
now that it's all that important to get

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.940 
now that it's all that important to get
it<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.120> tune<00:01:40.300> right<00:01:40.540> away<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.520> next<00:01:43.950> we're

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
it in tune right away so next we're

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.000 
it in tune right away so next we're
going<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.100> go<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.310> our<00:01:46.560> high<00:01:47.560> E<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:50.010> 0

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
going to go to our high E which is a 0

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.710 
going to go to our high E which is a 0
point<00:01:51.460> 0<00:01:51.570> 12<00:01:52.570> inch<00:01:53.050> diameter<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
point 0 12 inch diameter it's the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.840 
point 0 12 inch diameter it's the
thinnest<00:01:56.140> string<00:01:56.230> on<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> guitar<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.850> you
