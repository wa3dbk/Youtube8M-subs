00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 codified so today little video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.040
 so without my bag I really take 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.210
 every day in my purse I 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.730
 will really show you everything he 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.809
 there is inside 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 which I use every day so 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:24.990
 I present you and so we handbag 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.670
 is presented as these may so 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.050
 with small gling gling I love here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 there are small little hooks 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 grand-lancy the pit lane yesterday here is it 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.030
 so there were five sites where they say 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 from my bag 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 so that combines that I have you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.100
 spoken so I'm using different 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.020
 ways so three different ways 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.489
 so I'm sick now I have 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.030
 I'm really sorry I was lazy 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 leverage singing holiday so here I 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.880
 do not be like that really all 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.060
 days is to admire it behind that's it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 not good I like it in the period 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 initial 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.150
 there can be damage I do not know what 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:25.140
 happened behind that so I'm wearing 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:29.130
 as social either I wear myself as 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.450
 this so I often remove the brackets 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.310
 when I do not need it 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 but here I think you have them 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 never like that it depends if I want 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.479
 to wear me when it is so I love 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.170
 like that usually I put forward 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.979
 foot what so I put like this and of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.960
 sick with that was it was my 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 little bag that I do not really know all 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.950
 the days so I you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:04.119
 so first of all so first one 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:15.959
 closing of the camps and the bazaar on the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:15.959
 table so we will start 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.860
 so first of all my bag comes up 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.390
 so there is all the time so 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 Monday catalog inside because 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.739
 often when I'm at the doctor 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.510
 when I 'm waiting when I 'm waiting in high school 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.400
 that the teachers arrived all I have nothing under 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.800
 the hand so anyway quickly 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.989
 my handbag I take my test on 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.610

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:51.010
 so there are several tests there are some 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.620
 astros and I love his second small 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 thing so I think everyone 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.440
 know this little thing here it is with 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.940
 the idea will cost a little bit as he 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.750
 is no here's the little stuff there it's 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.430
 of the gnognotte 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.079
 he added 5 euros to crossroads so and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.610
 at crossroads too I bought this because 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.780
 that I really needed it and saw 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.549

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.320
 euros to crossroads 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.700
