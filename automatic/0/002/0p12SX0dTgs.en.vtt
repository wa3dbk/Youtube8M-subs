00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.230
 welcome aboard the hyundai i30 then 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.990
 the 30 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.940
 it is a compact competitor of 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.509
 Peugeot 308 Renault Megane or sail either 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.910
 4 gulf 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.720
 so this is an ultra discuss segment 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.910
 but there you have it with this i30 hyundai 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.660
 again demonstrates that the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.750
 Korean builder 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.189
 Well here and almost legal 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.369
 European generalist builders 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.399
 the proof we have here a double box 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.120
 seven-speed dct clutch a box 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.620
 double clutch 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.110
 there are not many manufacturers 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.750
 finally had one there especially the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.900
 volkswagen group with tsg alfa romeo 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.620
 with this summer here at the French by 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.380
 example peugeot 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.730
 finally the group psa name does not appear so 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 it's still automatic boxes 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.720
 who are ultra sweet to Kanak 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.070
 it's almost the best of the best and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.800
 so has one of the in has one 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.290
 that they developed internally 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.960
 so the box is associated with an engine 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.900
 110 horsepower diesel frankly 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 the combination of two impeccable we have 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.620
 of the couple it takes again without problem of the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.340
 big a little bit 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.670
 alive the automatic gearbox wins 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.490
 ground 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.860
 so why because their approval 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 still enormously progressed 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.240
 especially with his boxes the double in 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 trip and then also because basle and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.010
 these are the consumptions are no longer 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.670
 totally different and especially so 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.490
 CO2 emissions have drastically 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 dropped there before the old ones with the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 old transmission from hyundai 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.220
 we had to totally emissions 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.530
 crazy we had an important ball and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.500
 there was lowered by 40 g 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.720
 co2 so much to say more malus but 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.190
 the Korean builder still bugs and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.230
 always on the same issue 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.280
 that is to say a lack of notoriety 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.510
 so to fix it and has for example 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.170
 here on this i30 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.670
 he proposes a vitamin version said 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.520
 turbo that actually takes the engine l6 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.090
 286 horses of the veloster then we have a 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.390
 atmosphere obviously 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.260
 typical of the sports world with 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.599
 red upholstery and red stitching 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.760
 also an instrumentation that picks up 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.620
 that if these two typical colors this 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.530
 sports world we will not fool ourselves a 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.129
 know how to present sales sales 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.849
 marginal 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.010
 because here it is with 169 grams of 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.330
 co2 eh ben we are already 2200 euros from 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.660
 malus 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.180
 it's a bit unacceptable but hey 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.160
 simple proposing its to propose 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.620
 this model in its range 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.799
 it shows that the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.579
 Hyundai will search for almost every 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.579
 customer profiles 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.950
 the short the Korean builder 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.510
 now to a range that goes from the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:15.660
 small i10 at the big co-op limo 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.260
 genesis and so even within a range 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 of vehicles 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.480
 and here they offer a wide choice 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.220
 so we have for example the double in 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.310
 trip 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.350
 and then so this engine significantly more 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 vitamin can be used for 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.870
 who is looking for a little more 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.130
 sportiness and that's clearly with this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.170
 strategy type of a of a wide choice 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.130
 that the builder improves especially 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.030
 its image but also allow to 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.170
 meet the expectations of a virtually 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.170
 all buyer profiles
