similar manner last week an AutoCAD so
we're<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.029> borrow<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.420> same<00:00:24.660> model

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
we're gonna borrow that same model

we're gonna borrow that same model
actually<00:00:25.289> reproduce<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.369> some

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
actually reproduce it here in some

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.890 
actually reproduce it here in some
respects<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.510> show<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.750> everything

respects and I can show you everything
because<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.369> your

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
because some of this will be on your

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.479 
because some of this will be on your
in-class<00:00:30.539> evaluation<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.619> tomorrow<00:00:31.859> might

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
in-class evaluation for tomorrow might

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.680 
in-class evaluation for tomorrow might
you<00:00:32.610> show<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> enough<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.239> started<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you show you enough to get started and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.870 
you show you enough to get started and
one<00:00:34.050> thing<00:00:34.200> I'd<00:00:34.350> really<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> focus<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
one thing I'd really like to focus on is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
one thing I'd really like to focus on is
dimensioning<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.660> dimension<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.200> really

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
dimensioning because dimension is really

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
dimensioning because dimension is really
kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> tricky<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.489> kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> tricky<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
kind of tricky it's kind of tricky a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240 
kind of tricky it's kind of tricky a
Revit<00:00:39.239> architecture<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.960> once<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.530> go

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
Revit architecture but once you go

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.590 
Revit architecture but once you go
through<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> steps<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.329> did<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
through some of the steps like we did in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
through some of the steps like we did in
AutoCAD<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.079> steps<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.710> getting<00:00:43.829> drawing<00:00:44.250> set

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
AutoCAD and steps in getting drawing set

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610 
AutoCAD and steps in getting drawing set
up<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.000> getting<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> title<00:00:45.809> block<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.260> squared

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
up and getting a title block all squared

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
up and getting a title block all squared
away<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> viewport<00:00:47.430> squared<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.210> scaled

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
away in the viewport squared and scaled

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
away in the viewport squared and scaled
and<00:00:48.870> stuff<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.980> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> like

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and stuff like that it's kind of like

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
and stuff like that it's kind of like
the<00:00:50.430> same<00:00:50.670> sort<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.300> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.379> put<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the same sort of thing kind of put a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.200 
the same sort of thing kind of put a
dimension<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> put<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> wall<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.910> air

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
dimension in or you put a wall in air

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
dimension in or you put a wall in air
and<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.510> go<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.800> temporary

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and you go to the the temporary

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.889 
and you go to the the temporary
dimensions<00:00:56.600> establish<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> permanent

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
dimensions establish a permanent

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
dimensions establish a permanent
dimension<00:00:58.500> move<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> dimension<00:00:59.190> around

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
dimension move the dimension around

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
dimension move the dimension around
click<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> wall<00:01:00.629> again<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.500> change

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
click on the wall again and then change

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.520 
click on the wall again and then change
the<00:01:02.430> dimension<00:01:02.789> value<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.480> want

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
the dimension value to the one you want

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.509 
the dimension value to the one you want
and<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.830> through<00:01:05.010> those<00:01:05.159> three<00:01:05.369> or

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and if you go through those three or

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
and if you go through those three or
four<00:01:05.670> steps<00:01:05.909> involved<00:01:06.510> making<00:01:07.140> changes<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
four steps involved making changes to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100 
four steps involved making changes to
dimensions<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.810> pretty<00:01:09.960> easy

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
dimensions or actually it's pretty easy

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
dimensions or actually it's pretty easy
but<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.159> know<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> steps<00:01:11.670> you're

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
but if you don't know the steps you're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
but if you don't know the steps you're
never<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> able<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
never going to be able to do it so I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
never going to be able to do it so I
like<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> emphasize<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.909> with

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
like to kind of emphasize that with

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
like to kind of emphasize that with
these<00:01:15.180> videos<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.680> thing<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.950> want<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> do

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
these videos so one thing we want to do

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960 
these videos so one thing we want to do
with<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.640> apartment<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:20.610> two<00:01:20.759> walls

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
with this apartment is get the two walls

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
with this apartment is get the two walls
that<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.299> created<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.900> custom<00:01:22.080> wall<00:01:22.470> go

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that we created your custom wall go

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.210 
that we created your custom wall go
ahead<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.189> borrow<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.390> grab<00:01:25.220> you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
ahead and borrow that and then grab you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.679 
ahead and borrow that and then grab you
know<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> interior<00:01:26.850> wall<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.270> did<00:01:27.450> in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
know the interior wall that we did in

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
know the interior wall that we did in
the<00:01:28.020> defining<00:01:28.500> wall<00:01:28.680> structure<00:01:29.270> lesson<00:01:30.270> we

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the defining wall structure lesson we

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.440 
the defining wall structure lesson we
did<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.960> prior<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.290> tomorrow's<00:01:32.450> evaluation

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
did just prior to tomorrow's evaluation

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
did just prior to tomorrow's evaluation
let's<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.140> ahead<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.350> go<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:34.860> app

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
let's go ahead and go to the good app

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.469 
let's go ahead and go to the good app
off<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> file<00:01:35.970> open<00:01:36.360> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
off you don't have that file open in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
off you don't have that file open in
Revit<00:01:36.840> architecture<00:01:37.340> go<00:01:38.340> ahead<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.610> open<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
Revit architecture go ahead and open it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.149 
Revit architecture go ahead and open it
up<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.689> since<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> open<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.040> in

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
up and since I have it open and it's in

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
up and since I have it open and it's in
the<00:01:41.250> background<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.939> press<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> ctrl<00:01:42.659> key

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the background and it press the ctrl key

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.530 
the background and it press the ctrl key
and<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.079> tab<00:01:43.290> key<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.520> toggle<00:01:44.970> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and a tab key and actually toggle to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
and a tab key and actually toggle to
that<00:01:45.750> other<00:01:45.930> drawing<00:01:46.490> I'm<00:01:47.490> gonna<00:01:47.640> borrow<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that other drawing I'm gonna borrow that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.499 
that other drawing I'm gonna borrow that
so<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.990> believe<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.009> one

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
so it's this one I believe it's this one

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.690 
so it's this one I believe it's this one
now<00:01:51.509> that's<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.899> STC<00:01:52.500> 60<00:01:53.009> wall<00:01:53.220> looks<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
now that's my STC 60 wall looks like I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
now that's my STC 60 wall looks like I
spelled<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> wrong<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> should<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.750> STC<00:01:55.590> not

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
spelled that wrong it should be STC not

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
spelled that wrong it should be STC not
SCT<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.079> means<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> sound

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
SCT and what that means the sound

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.999 
SCT and what that means the sound
transmission<00:01:59.340> class<00:01:59.520> 60<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.710> said<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.829> sound

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
transmission class 60 I said that sound

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.370 
transmission class 60 I said that sound
class<00:02:02.250> transmission<00:02:02.880> 60<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.390> anyways<00:02:03.689> anyways

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
class transmission 60 so anyways anyways

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.569 
class transmission 60 so anyways anyways
we're<00:02:04.740> gonna<00:02:04.890> borrow<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.219> wall<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
we're gonna borrow this wall and I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.980 
we're gonna borrow this wall and I
believe<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.149> exterior<00:02:06.600> wall<00:02:06.810> we're

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
believe this is my exterior wall we're

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
believe this is my exterior wall we're
gonna<00:02:07.079> go<00:02:07.259> ahead<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.500> borrow<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:08.220> those

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
gonna go ahead and borrow that are those

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.119 
gonna go ahead and borrow that are those
too<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.690> borrow<00:02:10.080> or<00:02:10.410> copy<00:02:10.800> two

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
too so the way you borrow or copy two

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.110 
too so the way you borrow or copy two
things<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
things and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.210 
things and
in<00:02:12.239> Revit<00:02:12.989> architecture<00:02:13.080> or<00:02:13.650> pretty<00:02:13.860> much<00:02:13.920> any

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
in Revit architecture or pretty much any

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.160 
in Revit architecture or pretty much any
windows-based<00:02:14.730> design<00:02:15.420> program<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.989> this

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
windows-based design program like this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
windows-based design program like this
whether<00:02:16.769> it's<00:02:16.920> AutoCAD<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.370> Revit<00:02:17.910> or

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
whether it's AutoCAD or Revit or

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330 
whether it's AutoCAD or Revit or
SolidWorks<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.500> press<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> control<00:02:20.310> key

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
SolidWorks is you press the control key

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.770 
SolidWorks is you press the control key
allows<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.030> select<00:02:21.150> multiple<00:02:21.660> elements

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
allows you to select multiple elements

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.380 
allows you to select multiple elements
and<00:02:22.459> we<00:02:23.459> know<00:02:23.610> these<00:02:23.760> elements<00:02:24.209> are<00:02:24.300> selected

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and we know these elements are selected

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.850 
and we know these elements are selected
because<00:02:24.690> they've<00:02:24.959> turned<00:02:25.140> blue<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.739> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
because they've turned blue in a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.900 
because they've turned blue in a
typically<00:02:26.250> turn<00:02:26.489> blue

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
typically turn blue

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
typically turn blue
when<00:02:27.239> they've<00:02:27.390> been<00:02:27.420> selected<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.230> once<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
when they've been selected so once you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
when they've been selected so once you
have<00:02:28.890> those<00:02:29.069> two<00:02:29.129> we're<00:02:29.519> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> ctrl

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
have those two we're going to do a ctrl

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.710 
have those two we're going to do a ctrl
C<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:32.310> ctrl<00:02:32.670> tab<00:02:32.879> allows<00:02:33.360> us<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.510> toggle

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
C and then ctrl tab allows us to toggle

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.080 
C and then ctrl tab allows us to toggle
back<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.349> our<00:02:34.560> other<00:02:34.920> program<00:02:35.400> into<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
back to that our other program into a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.880 
back to that our other program into a
control<00:02:36.510> V<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> all<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.680> just

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
control V and all you have to do is just

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.229 
control V and all you have to do is just
drop<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> into<00:02:38.340> place<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.760> notice<00:02:39.090> there's

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
drop it into place so you notice there's

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.759 
drop it into place so you notice there's
a<00:02:39.360> couple<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.900> different<00:02:40.200> things<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.530> on

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
a couple of different things going on

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.860 
a couple of different things going on
here<00:02:40.980> there's<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.250> boxes<00:02:41.970> following<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:42.480> cursor

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
here there's a boxes following my cursor

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750 
here there's a boxes following my cursor
and<00:02:43.560> there's<00:02:43.769> another<00:02:44.040> box<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.489> actually

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and there's another box it actually

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.690 
and there's another box it actually
shows<00:02:44.940> where<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> where<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.630> walls<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
shows where the where the walls are I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.009 
shows where the where the walls are I
kind<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> ignore<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.239> for<00:02:48.420> now<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.900> do

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
kind of ignore this for now if you do

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.020 
kind of ignore this for now if you do
nothing<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:49.530> press<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.459> Enter<00:02:50.670> key

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
nothing but press the Enter key

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.900 
nothing but press the Enter key
it'll<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.510> drop<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.049> in<00:02:52.140> place<00:02:52.170> right<00:02:52.590> there

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
it'll just drop it in place right there

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.339 
it'll just drop it in place right there
or<00:02:53.910> we<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.209> control<00:02:54.569> over<00:02:54.630> where<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.110> want<00:02:55.290> to

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
or we have control over where we want to

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.319 
or we have control over where we want to
drop<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.739> what<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.519> want<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:56.970> can't<00:02:57.180> drop

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
drop it what I want to do is can't drop

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.740 
drop it what I want to do is can't drop
it<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.379> corner<00:02:58.680> up<00:02:58.799> here<00:02:59.629> and<00:03:00.629> you'll

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
it up in the corner up here and you'll

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.059 
it up in the corner up here and you'll
notice<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.140> just<00:03:01.319> kind<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.530> drops<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.920> into

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069
