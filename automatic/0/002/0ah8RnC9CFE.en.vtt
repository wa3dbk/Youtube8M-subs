00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.350
 At first it is start, but Shirai san wanted to have roof softly 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.770
 The example I had was a good start . 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.670
 After all, say standing know also that go 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.720
 Lee 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:21.220
 I thought the same kana because too Yeah but the first half still 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.740
 I thought if the Na or say to Fu refers to this hill in consuming feeling there is suffering Kebai 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.510
 Yes it because you have different come by I took with you 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 Moreover, the next horse has a positive two-digit 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.390
 Answer no failure 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 And a little vertical development 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.000
 Well popularity 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.460
 It came down 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.720
 It is deployment that Majesty House is the highest peak Because this around is still going out 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.829
 The part wants to go 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.970
 That's right- 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.550
 also 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.300
 The neck is moving from side to side 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.400
 There is that still neck in here is moving to the left and right 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 This I 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.309
 A scene like you're gone 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.500
 First you have cat the goods guess I is quickly trying to suppress rather have shorter 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.199
 I do not have all of the ball ball because this ice 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.329
 Shihori Eiger always 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.680
 It became a form that put a cat tie show in front after this 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.850
 This difficulty in Well yes this area will do has changed 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.920
 Yes, I was able to Chin a 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.010
 The one who ran away is the speed and the white hat outside is coping and its back is coping 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.280
 I'm an Epiphane 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:34.840
 It is quite a longitudinal development while it contains moisture 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.340
 How about that for other horses this is the point pace that Epiphania is in front of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 Did not experience too much 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 That's right value ordering 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.300
 After all it is in front of the favorite burner 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.300
 Besides, the pace is faster and I can not push it 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.760
 Among them, let me go to the previous two and entered the second week 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:59.890
 At the other it was completely turned really 12 corner I think you continue to 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.260
 Well Oriae Zutsui went into it Yes attachment was Satono Noblesse is now orange waist 14 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.060
 You can turn 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.580
 Gradually there from along the inner Lachi 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.380
 came 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.450
 Well then, it 's on the slope of the 20th, what about this end of Ripley? 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.250
 Is not it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.690
 It is really horse 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.600
 With this wind 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.100
 Hmm 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.020
 Onma is calm 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.930
 Say chase come 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.310
 The second cat , the cat tie show, is stuck with the Eva board sunk in the horses here . 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.010
 Hey this 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.689
 Thing with the same result of pedigree 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.689
 I thought the tank would come 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.830
 Sticky place 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.830
 Kameya 9 minutes 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.260
 Another here do not have to do a name that it may be either still or you go sign 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.800
 But I am from this past yes 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.350
 Have no discontinuance 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.460
 I should already want to drink this thing 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:10.310
 It seems that everyone knows you fr 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:11.480
 It looks so ordered Act II of that first lap of that was pulled out of the raw leg of this side 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.819
