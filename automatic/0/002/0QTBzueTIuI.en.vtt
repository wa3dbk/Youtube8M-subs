00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.290
 good the fast that we use 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.660
 in swayze but that always also low 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.630
 medical professionalism attention 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.180
 medical and also psychological medical and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.460
 psychologists who know fasting well 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.480
 that we know all the processes that are 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.739
 they wake up organically and 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.900
 psychologically in fasting we can 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.380
 accompany from our experience of 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.500
 decades we always like to say that the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.080
 fast is cool this is risk but there is no 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.019
 risk in fasting do not appear more than 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.660
 some detoxification crises that 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.030
 can eliminate toxic substances that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.400
 they help us to the regeneration process and 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.379
 of healing during fasting 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.750
 decrease the weight 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.480
 you can reduce body fat 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.280
 You can lower cholesterol and 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.730
 then from there your body 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.560
 will continue to recover is regenerating 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.229
 in the fast the water will be removed 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.040
 retained in the body the water is 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.930
 characteristic of water retention 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.940
 during diseases 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.040
 or holds water to divide the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.750
 toxic substances and substances of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.450
 scrap there are many people 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.850
 especially women who have 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.370
 affinity with water and there are many 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.800
 women who retain the water that holds 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.080
 liquids but the water is retained with the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.540
 purpose of diluting the substances 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.970
 toxic substances and to dilute the substances 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.550
 waste and then to be less 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.160
 concentrated they do less damage do 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.979
 less harm to the body and to the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.800
 organism during fasting the body 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.950
 divine that retained water is also 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.140
 eliminate substances that are retained to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.960
 organic level in each of the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.750
 organs and how the body does 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.270
 guided by the instinct of conservation 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.030
 during fasting cysts are degraded 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.940
 eliminate tumors decrease access 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.400
 the boils the grains we have 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.620
 seen for many decades we have seen 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.120
 that even the skin diminishes at 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.890
 diseases decreases the angles 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.020
 decrease dermatitis decrease 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.200
 They may even disappear one 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.700
 during fasting because the body 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.580
 facilitates the elimination through the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.760
 skin tissues are also used in 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.730
 organ in reverse order to its 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.280
 importance during the fast is eliminated 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.100
 a lot of fat deposits are removed 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.860
 what's in the liver but for example the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.490
 brain and heart just lose weight 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.550
 they just lose nothing of their weight then 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.640
 the body does not commit suicide never commits suicide 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.630
 and less during the fast will do the possible 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.980
 for the healing to start 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.830
 even the immune system is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.920
 recognizes that it increases during fasting and 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.230
 that improve health conditions in 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.270
 all the organism 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.360
 old pains that you thought 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.330
 they were healed that you had relieved with 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.700
 with the medicines with the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.950
 medicines reappear 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.160
 from leftist medicine always 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.470
 we say that it is different very different 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.080
 relieve that healing and relieving is easy 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.050
 doubt is a medicine and relieve the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.380
 disease but cure is another thing to cure 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.470
 is to eliminate toxic substances is 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.019
 regenerate is to reintegrate the zones 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.780
 unbalanced of the organism and that what 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.049
 knows better than anything as a technique 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.780
 fasting and that's precisely in the fast 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.360
 symptoms appear that you thought were cured 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.239
 that you had relieved with opposite 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.560
 medications but that through fasting 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.569
 these symptoms reappear 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.730
 can be headache can be to 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.160
 Sometimes nausea can be vomiting 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.519
 you can eliminate diarrhea through 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.799
 those elimination organs many times 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.769
 what we call illness is not 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.470
 truly a disease signify a 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.770
 detoxification crisis through the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.190
 detoxification I 'm healing 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.330
 and then from the fast I put 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.580
 that energy at hand within reach of each 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.550
 one of their bodies so that they 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.460
 regenerate and through fasting you can 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.530
 recover that degree of health that has gone 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.539
 losing when using along 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.030
 last years this is what you 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.789
 we propose in your appearance you have the 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.810
 healing ability to self cure you to 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.419
 yourself 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.330
 learning to stop eating when 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.090
 you are sick and this can not be what 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.880
 You can apply later when you 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.759
 go home when you have a cold 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.699
 when you have a flu when you have 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:11.220
 fever and you do not feel like eating is the 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.830
 time to fast is the time to 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.650
 keep fasting while you drink water 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.650
 because it is important it is important 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.360
 maintain body hydration 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.789
 especially in young children a 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.099
 little boy may be without eating but 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.530
 can not be and should not be without drinking 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.840
 the implantation of the body is important 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.110
 keep the body hydrated during the 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.260
 year 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.890
 it's important and this is what you can 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.320
 learn in swift that later 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.390
 when you have an illness or 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.630
 symptoms of the disease you can 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.450
 concentrate healing energy 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.730
 stop eating the energy you save 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.610
 in nutrition in digestion and 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.340
 assimilation of the food is channeled 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.490
 towards the organs of elimination and you 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.160
 you will be healing this is what you 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.830
 we propose from the swype the biggest 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.470
 healing ability that we 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.840
 we know through the application of 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.840
 fasting guided always
