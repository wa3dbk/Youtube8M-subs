questions I've got about this subject

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.380 
questions I've got about this subject
does<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.320> iPad<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.160> case<00:00:17.369> fit<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> iPad<00:00:18.210> 2

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
does the iPad one case fit on the iPad 2

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.179 
does the iPad one case fit on the iPad 2
so<00:00:18.600> I'm<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> demonstrate<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
so I'm just going to demonstrate it so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.849 
so I'm just going to demonstrate it so
you<00:00:20.279> guys<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.150> fit<00:00:21.529> those<00:00:22.529> slips

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
you guys see how it fit those slips

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.890 
you guys see how it fit those slips
right<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:24.150> snug<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.660> course

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
right in it's not very snug of course

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170 
right in it's not very snug of course
because<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> iPad<00:00:25.800> 2<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> lot<00:00:26.609> thinner<00:00:26.910> than

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
because the iPad 2 is a lot thinner than

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.849 
because the iPad 2 is a lot thinner than
iPad<00:00:27.660> 1<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.650> tuck<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> flap<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.869> there

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
iPad 1 just tuck the flap in and there

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.720 
iPad 1 just tuck the flap in and there
you<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> does<00:00:34.350> fit<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you go so actually it does fit it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
you go so actually it does fit it
doesn't<00:00:35.910> fit<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.210> snugly<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> see

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
doesn't fit very snugly so you can see

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.630 
doesn't fit very snugly so you can see
it's<00:00:37.469> pretty<00:00:37.739> loose<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it's pretty loose so you can see the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
it's pretty loose so you can see the
material<00:00:38.760> bunches<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> back<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:41.250> can

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
material bunches up on the back you can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
material bunches up on the back you can
see<00:00:41.610> there's<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> lot<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.420> distance<00:00:42.809> between

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
see there's a lot of distance between

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.680 
see there's a lot of distance between
the<00:00:43.559> dock<00:00:43.890> connector<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> opening<00:00:45.300> scene

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the dock connector and the opening scene

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.090 
the dock connector and the opening scene
with<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> speaker<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> speaker<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
with the speaker the speaker is going to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
with the speaker the speaker is going to
be<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.850> covered<00:00:48.210> over<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.660> I'll

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
be a little bit covered over here I'll

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.500 
be a little bit covered over here I'll
test<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.320> I'll<00:00:49.469> turn<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.820> music<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
test that I'll turn on some music so you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
test that I'll turn on some music so you
can<00:00:51.539> hear<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> volume

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
can hear it and you can see the volume

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
can hear it and you can see the volume
controls<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.000> sort<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> hidden<00:00:54.780> behind<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
controls are sort of hidden behind the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.510 
controls are sort of hidden behind the
material<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.890> kind<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.190> operate

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
material but you can kind of operate

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250 
material but you can kind of operate
them<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> material<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:58.050> can't

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
them through the material you can't

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900 
them through the material you can't
really<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> switch<00:00:59.129> too<00:00:59.340> easily<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
really get to the switch too easily and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
really get to the switch too easily and
then<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> lock<00:01:01.559> button<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.100> here

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
then we have the lock button up here

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
then we have the lock button up here
again<00:01:02.609> sort<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> hidden<00:01:03.210> behind<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.629> material

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
again sort of hidden behind the material

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.359 
again sort of hidden behind the material
but<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.170> can't<00:01:04.409> operate<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.890> through<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
but you can't operate it through the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
but you can't operate it through the
material<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:06.510> headphone<00:01:06.869> jack<00:01:06.960> will<00:01:07.380> fit<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
material your headphone jack will fit in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
material your headphone jack will fit in
here<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.549> microphone<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> covered<00:01:09.750> on

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
here but your microphone is covered on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
here but your microphone is covered on
the<00:01:10.080> front<00:01:10.350> nothing<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> covered<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> ambient

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the front nothing is covered the ambient

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
the front nothing is covered the ambient
light<00:01:12.119> sensor<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> FaceTime<00:01:13.229> camera<00:01:13.290> are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
light sensor and the FaceTime camera are

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.050 
light sensor and the FaceTime camera are
free<00:01:14.689> but<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> course<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
free but of course on the back the the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
free but of course on the back the the
camera<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> rear<00:01:19.229> facing<00:01:19.439> camera<00:01:19.860> is

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
camera the the rear facing camera is

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
camera the the rear facing camera is
blocked<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> can't<00:01:20.909> use<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
blocked so you can't use it when it's in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
blocked so you can't use it when it's in
this<00:01:21.750> case<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.860> other<00:01:23.040> problem<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> see

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this case and the other problem you see

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
this case and the other problem you see
here<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.360> basically<00:01:24.979> flapping

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
here is that it's basically flapping

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
here is that it's basically flapping
around<00:01:26.100> inside<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> opening<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.659> you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
around inside the opening so you can you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.780 
around inside the opening so you can you
can't<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.530> pull<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.640> not

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
can't quite pull it out but it's not

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
can't quite pull it out but it's not
really<00:01:30.150> secure<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> propping

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
really secure in there now the propping

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.609 
really secure in there now the propping
feature<00:01:32.159> still<00:01:32.490> works<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.939> course<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> can

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
feature still works of course so you can

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.340 
feature still works of course so you can
do<00:01:35.070> landscape<00:01:35.579> mode<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.780> keyboard

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
do landscape mode or you can do keyboard

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
do landscape mode or you can do keyboard
mode<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> demonstrate<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
mode now just to demonstrate how the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.820 
mode now just to demonstrate how the
speaker<00:01:39.450> works<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.259> case

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
speaker works through this case

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.070 
speaker works through this case
now<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.880> course<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.180> can<00:01:43.360> hear<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.630> but<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.930> is

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
now of course you can hear it but it is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.900 
now of course you can hear it but it is
a<00:01:44.110> little<00:01:44.350> muffled<00:01:44.800> now<00:01:45.460> let's<00:01:45.700> see<00:01:45.790> the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
a little muffled now let's see the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.250 
a little muffled now let's see the
difference<00:01:46.030> when<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.510> pull<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.750> out<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
difference when we pull it out of the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.360 
difference when we pull it out of the
case<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.410> can<00:01:50.530> indeed<00:01:50.890> see<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> big

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
case so you can indeed see a big

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.810 
case so you can indeed see a big
difference<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:53.950> go<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.250> does<00:01:54.460> work

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
difference so there you go it does work

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.180 
difference so there you go it does work
on<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.360> temporary<00:01:55.840> basis<00:01:56.410> I<00:01:56.590> wouldn't<00:01:56.920> use<00:01:57.040> this

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
on a temporary basis I wouldn't use this

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.730 
on a temporary basis I wouldn't use this
long<00:01:57.460> term<00:01:57.760> see<00:01:58.330> if<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.480> guys<00:01:58.600> buy<00:01:59.170> an<00:01:59.320> iPad

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
long term see if you guys buy an iPad

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.800 
long term see if you guys buy an iPad
and<00:02:00.130> have<00:02:00.280> one<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.610> these<00:02:00.670> cases<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.300> want<00:02:01.750> to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and have one of these cases and want to

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.660 
and have one of these cases and want to
wait<00:02:01.960> for<00:02:02.200> some<00:02:02.380> other<00:02:02.500> cases<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:03.040> come<00:02:03.220> by<00:02:03.400> if

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
wait for some other cases to come by if

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.030 
wait for some other cases to come by if
the<00:02:04.090> Apple<00:02:04.600> Smart<00:02:04.870> Cover<00:02:05.080> doesn't<00:02:05.500> cut<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.860> for

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
the Apple Smart Cover doesn't cut it for

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.910 
the Apple Smart Cover doesn't cut it for
you<00:02:06.190> then<00:02:06.820> this<00:02:07.150> certainly<00:02:07.570> will<00:02:07.990> work<00:02:08.020> so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
you then this certainly will work so

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.500 
you then this certainly will work so
once<00:02:09.100> again<00:02:09.190> guys<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.820> Detroit<00:02:10.119> Borg
