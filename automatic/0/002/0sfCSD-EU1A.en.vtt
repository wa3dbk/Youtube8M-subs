00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.680
 We are starting one more patati today. 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.600
 let's learn how to make applications 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.410
 using double weave of the sec 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.150
 layman 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.530
 let's make the application of two hearts 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.430
 were used to make the pocket 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.330
 environmental 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.330
 let's go to the materials 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.539
 materials are as follows in the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.109
 rectangle of 25 by 18 that will serve as 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.429
 base for our pocket a retail of 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:43.769
 fabric home a piece of fabric and lilac 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:51.429
 and white stripes line approaching 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:54.039
 scissors and heart-shaped pen in 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:58.420
 double tec interlinings pieces 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:02.350
 nebo and needle 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 Let's first start our step very well. 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.240
 first step will be to scratch the heart 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.090
 on this paper side of the naive screen 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.920
 infect it has side and 20 is paper 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.719
 other side interlace with some points 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 bright that does not glue 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.920
 this glue group will only be activated at 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.590
 from the famous right taking the role 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.509
 protector we have that side the glue 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.840
 and if the ball does not need to be 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.880
 warmed it is already rolling now let's go 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.539
 position the template on the side of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.539
 scarce 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.460
 done that we will report the mold 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.700
 leaving a small margin around the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.700
 heart 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.430
 This margin is what we leave to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.350
 we can remember then entertain together 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.250
 with the fabric when the two are 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.720
 do and another one very well now we 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.690
 Let's put our our modcom 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.940
 side of the inteli in the back of the heart and 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.380
 Let's warm up with sure I'm using 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.780
 iron the cotton position and I will leave it for 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.710
 about 15 seconds on mine. 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.810
 application 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.350
 The proerd is without water and with steam 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.630
 the time and temperature that you have 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.020
 going to use iron depends a lot on your 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.040
 iron is important to do since 7 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.350
 you make your application 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.650
 here I already had a heart. 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.920
 tissue now I will strengthen upon the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.720
 Today's risk I went near the eyes and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.720
 You may notice that I did not down 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.380
 important it will be in sinop that for you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.540
 remove the protective paper and a 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.730
 another legal tip is to verify that this 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.140
 part of the paper here with yellows 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.820
 that it becomes very yellowish is a sign 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.070
 What are you using very hot hill? 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.440
 or leaving a lot of time problems 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.680
 take off protective paper 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.960
 here I already have my heart without a hat 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.690
 teacher can you see this side 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.300
 it already sticks even without heating the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.250
 paper because it's a colada and live ready 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.680
 to be fixed to our base in the pocket is 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.150
 that already is well adhered enough 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.860
 for us we can put the moment in 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.690
 what stage to see the future the mass 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.820
 here I already have another thousand heart 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.480
 done the same way I'll take the paper 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.490
 which the sector has already lazialized 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.940
 position my heart 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.060
 one of the advantages of the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.950
 is that you can withdraw 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.040
 reposition if you think you're not 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.530
 glued to a photo of your wish ready to 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.730
 your application made and now let's focus 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.950
 final regret 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.620
 now probably signal is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.910
 inserting the needle here WS 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.250
 fabric 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.170
 she's going to have the side of her heart now 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.310
 I'll get a little piece of my heart here. 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.220
 on the border 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.230
 I just again on the side passing the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.390
 needle inside that evil is gone 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.270
 show make my first dots 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.700
 Phased finish can be done by hand 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.239
 the marina but it's important that you do 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.240
 the here 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.100
 just because and definitely at the party that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.950
 can you wash look one more 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.310
 Then again we take the side of 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.850
 Heart leave here from the side. 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.150
 we are prudent to reach them more 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.460
 a little bit the trip that we have to 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.260
 Get ready two hearts already applied 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.950
 in pocket and environmental 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.290
 only you read the whole booty diary 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.410
 You can vary it by doing different themes 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.000
 and creating lines pieces with one on screen 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.890
 double-sided sec read 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.300
 I hope you have enjoyed it until 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.300
 close up make art
