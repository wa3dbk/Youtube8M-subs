00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
be covering a video on how to clean the

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.830 
be covering a video on how to clean the
midsole<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.640> all<00:04:18.970> souls<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.450> Roche<00:04:19.600> ones

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
midsole and all souls of the Roche ones

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.479 
midsole and all souls of the Roche ones
because<00:04:20.170> I've<00:04:20.709> seen<00:04:20.769> like<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> lot<00:04:21.370> of

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
because I've seen like a lot of

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.310 
because I've seen like a lot of
restoration<00:04:22.120> people<00:04:22.390> do<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:22.870> stuff<00:04:23.050> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
restoration people do that and stuff and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.500 
restoration people do that and stuff and
I<00:04:23.590> guess<00:04:24.040> like<00:04:24.280> once<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.730> gets<00:04:24.880> dirty<00:04:25.060> it's<00:04:25.330> not

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
I guess like once it gets dirty it's not

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.390 
I guess like once it gets dirty it's not
that<00:04:25.690> easy<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.140> clean<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.590> I'll<00:04:26.830> try<00:04:27.010> my<00:04:27.130> best

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
that easy to clean so I'll try my best

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.060 
that easy to clean so I'll try my best
at<00:04:27.610> giving<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.450> guys<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.630> video<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.350> the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
at giving you guys a video that and the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.950 
at giving you guys a video that and the
one<00:04:30.220> thing<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.550> I'm<00:04:30.880> going<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.150> criticize<00:04:31.480> is

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
one thing that I'm going to criticize is

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.350 
one thing that I'm going to criticize is
the<00:04:32.200> back<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.010> shoe<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.310> heel<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.700> not

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the back of the shoe the heel and not

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.550 
the back of the shoe the heel and not
it's<00:04:34.540> not<00:04:34.690> because<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:34.990> how<00:04:35.140> it<00:04:35.260> looks<00:04:35.410> and

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
it's not because of how it looks and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.830 
it's not because of how it looks and
stuff<00:04:35.740> but<00:04:35.920> usually<00:04:36.910> when<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.120> buy<00:04:37.270> shoes<00:04:37.540> it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
stuff but usually when you buy shoes it

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.450 
stuff but usually when you buy shoes it
has<00:04:37.990> some<00:04:38.170> sort<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.440> support<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.010> back<00:04:39.220> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
has some sort of support in the back and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.120 
has some sort of support in the back and
that<00:04:40.090> support<00:04:40.480> is<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:41.260> support<00:04:41.620> is<00:04:41.710> given<00:04:41.980> by

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
that support is that support is given by

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.640 
that support is that support is given by
a<00:04:42.160> TPU<00:04:42.730> or<00:04:43.180> plastic<00:04:43.780> or<00:04:43.900> shank<00:04:44.200> play<00:04:44.410> whatever

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
a TPU or plastic or shank play whatever

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.380 
a TPU or plastic or shank play whatever
it<00:04:44.890> could<00:04:45.010> be<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.669> adds<00:04:45.820> rigidity<00:04:46.000> and

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
it could be and it adds rigidity and

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.080 
it could be and it adds rigidity and
supports<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.960> shoe<00:04:47.230> but<00:04:47.890> when<00:04:48.669> pressing<00:04:48.910> down

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
supports the shoe but when pressing down

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.520 
supports the shoe but when pressing down
on<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.270> heel<00:04:49.480> there<00:04:49.750> isn't<00:04:49.990> much<00:04:50.110> support

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
on the heel there isn't much support

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.870 
on the heel there isn't much support
what<00:04:50.830> actually<00:04:51.190> feels<00:04:51.400> like<00:04:51.550> it's<00:04:51.700> like<00:04:51.790> a

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
what actually feels like it's like a

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.730 
what actually feels like it's like a
piece<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.060> cardboard<00:04:52.419> here<00:04:52.750> so<00:04:53.350> yeah<00:04:53.530> these

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
piece of cardboard here so yeah these

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.560 
piece of cardboard here so yeah these
aren't<00:04:54.220> apply<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.790> good<00:04:54.970> for<00:04:55.150> running<00:04:55.390> but
