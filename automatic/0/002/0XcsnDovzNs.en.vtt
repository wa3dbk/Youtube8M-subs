00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the next one is prometheus because I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.380 
the next one is prometheus because I
really<00:02:06.930> wanted<00:02:07.140> him<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.380> Arkham<00:02:07.770> origins

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
really wanted him in Arkham origins

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.639 
really wanted him in Arkham origins
because<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.600> thought<00:02:09.780> his<00:02:09.959> bauxite<00:02:10.320> would<00:02:10.470> be

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
because I thought his bauxite would be

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.979 
because I thought his bauxite would be
amazing<00:02:10.920> he<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.820> if<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.600> about

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
amazing he is if you don't know about

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.720 
amazing he is if you don't know about
him<00:02:13.290> he's<00:02:13.500> pretty<00:02:13.739> much<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> opposite<00:02:14.310> Batman

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
him he's pretty much the opposite Batman

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.610 
him he's pretty much the opposite Batman
and<00:02:14.850> his<00:02:14.940> parents<00:02:15.390> were<00:02:15.510> killed<00:02:15.840> by<00:02:16.290> cops

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and his parents were killed by cops

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.000 
and his parents were killed by cops
because<00:02:17.010> they<00:02:17.160> were<00:02:17.220> criminals<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.680> he

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
because they were criminals and so he

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.190 
because they were criminals and so he
goes<00:02:20.280> around<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.730> he's<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> cop-killer<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
goes around and he's a cop-killer and it

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.280 
goes around and he's a cop-killer and it
would<00:02:22.320> be<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.680> perfect<00:02:23.190> side<00:02:23.370> mission<00:02:23.989> or<00:02:24.989> I

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.629 
so awesome all the possibilities you
could<00:06:48.570> do<00:06:48.720> with<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:49.050> these<00:06:49.650> characters<00:06:50.280> cuz

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
could do with the these characters cuz

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.420 
could do with the these characters cuz
you<00:06:50.880> got<00:06:51.030> their<00:06:51.599> talons<00:06:52.199> I<00:06:52.500> don't<00:06:53.010> know<00:06:53.070> how

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
you got their talons I don't know how

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.680 
you got their talons I don't know how
they<00:06:53.610> would<00:06:53.699> have<00:06:53.849> you<00:06:53.970> beat<00:06:54.180> the<00:06:54.330> talons

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
they would have you beat the talons

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.540 
they would have you beat the talons
gameplay-wise<00:06:55.199> that'd<00:06:55.680> be<00:06:55.830> interesting

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
gameplay-wise that'd be interesting

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.480 
gameplay-wise that'd be interesting
of<00:06:56.940> course<00:06:57.260> freezing<00:06:58.260> them<00:06:58.409> you<00:06:58.530> can<00:06:58.770> stop

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
of course freezing them you can stop

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.930 
of course freezing them you can stop
their<00:06:59.699> healing<00:06:59.880> factor<00:07:00.360> like<00:07:00.539> that<00:07:00.750> so<00:07:01.080> if<00:07:01.940> you

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
their healing factor like that so if you

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.070 
their healing factor like that so if you
get<00:07:03.090> something<00:07:03.449> like<00:07:03.510> that<00:07:03.810> because<00:07:04.020> I

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
get something like that because I

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.420 
get something like that because I
thought<00:07:04.229> I<00:07:04.500> heard<00:07:04.680> there's<00:07:04.949> not<00:07:05.099> gonna<00:07:05.220> be<00:07:05.280> any

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
thought I heard there's not gonna be any
