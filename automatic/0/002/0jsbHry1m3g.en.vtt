00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.770
 will show how to prepare mini 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.309
 appetizer bites for this we 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.529
 will need grated cheese 2 chorizo 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.920
 of white ham with béchamel sauce and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 course mini canapés that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.439
 you can find a supermarket or 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.289
 although you can do it yourself at 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.520
 using a bat fayoter in a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 first time preheat your oven to 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.620
 180 ° for butcher I chose to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 to make a common base 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.079
 that is to say that in all the mouths 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 and we will find béchamel at 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 cheese 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 for that I add a little cheese 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:56.239
 grated damascus bechamel like these ci that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.239
 I incorporate well as it should 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 until a homogeneous mixture is obtained 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 and now I'm going to be able to stuff 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.610
 but butcher for my part I chose to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.610
 to make uncork with ham and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 béchamel cheese and others with chorizo 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.040
 and cheese béchamel 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.979
 you can of course lead to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.570
 fragrance of your choices 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 so let's start with the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 butchers with chorizo 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.740
 for that I arranged my little ones 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.180
 bites on a tray and I cut 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.729
 a small cube slices of chorizo ​​and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
 slices of ham 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 then to make the chorizo ​​butchers 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:54.290
 I dispose at the end of a few 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:54.290
 cubes of chorizo ​​like this 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.890
 and I will come to cover everything 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.890
 Bechamel 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:15.400
 so here I take my mouth and and I 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:22.690
 just fill out well as it takes 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:28.440
 béchamel by removing the surplus and I 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.440
 the same goes for the other bites 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.980
 here I take off the surplus and you 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.870
 repeat the process several times 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.890
 here I have garnished everything but butcher 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.010
 chorizo 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.950
 now I'm going to have on each 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 mouthful again two more cubes 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.550
 chorizo ​​like this so that the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.550
 butchers be a little more aesthetic 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.470
 that's it and I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.320
 cheese rapping it on the top 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.610
 opportunities for that au gratin a little 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.620
 here 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.530
 and you have to repeat the operation on 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.959
 all the mouths and and here are our 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.150
 butchers with chorizo smell ready 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.660
 I will now go to the butchers 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.900
 with ham for butchers with ham I 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.360
 proceeds in the same way I have a 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.440
 little ham at the bottom of the mouth and 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.440
 like this here 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.570
 and I'm going to cover everything with bechamel 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.870
 I proceed as before to 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.260
 fill but bechamel butcher never 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.520
 in a teaspoon and then I fill 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.510
 the mouth and removing the excess 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.510
 then I will come and have 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.390
 some pieces of ham on the béchamel 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.020
 and I'm going to cover the whole thing two ends 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.850
 of cheese I repeat the operation 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.650
 several times 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.750
 here are my two types of meaning butcher 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.920
 now ready I'll be able to 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.820
 bake at 180 ° for 5 to 10 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.170
 minutes and that's it after about seven 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.910
 minutes in the oven 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.650
 the butchers are ready to be 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.650
 tasted thank you to all
