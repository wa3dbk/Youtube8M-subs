00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello people i have today again 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.870
 a cosmetics hall for you i know 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 I said that in the last 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.240
 maybe the last runner a lot 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.009
 could be a very long time and that was 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 also a comparatively long time 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.070
 in my opinion, the things I do 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.020
 Of course, not everyone is showing you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 at once, many are from my shop 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.189
 come to this 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.529
 I never bought more than mine 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.700
 Purse admitted yes even if 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.559
 some things which perhaps the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.059
 but absolutely necessary to learn 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.620
 I really stuck to myself 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 I could have bought a lot more 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.430
 and if I can beside you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.930
 already accumulated a lot but how 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.850
 I said I had the vacation box 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 I got the additional payment 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
 I did not completely clog where 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.190
 I am very proud of myself and without 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.390
 further talk before that because 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.949
 I am sure you are interested in anything 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.070
 no longer justify why I show ' 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.730
 bought my money is like that 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.440
 we simply receive 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
 I just grab beside me again 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.359
 this box the first thing I give you time 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.380
 is not so exciting that it's from barea 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.070
 a hand soap this 20 years balea 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 special editions and that is with 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.420
 rhubarb and strawberry blossom and alone 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960
 that's why I had to have it and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.250
 it smells really very delicious 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.689
 and actually I would prefer it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.759
 eat with it instead of my hands 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.049
 but I'll wash it up 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.130
 The mall is probably not that good 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.049
 tastes like it smells too of then 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 valea I have the beauty effect 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.420
 rebuilt halloren booster donates 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.400
 super super good moisture and straight 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 when it's hot, the skin dries 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 so quickly and so I have 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.119
 not opened 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.400
 but I have such an empty one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.770
 and that's why I had to go after 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.549
 buy because he is really good and me 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.280
 I'm afraid I have a wasp in the room 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.600
 Let's hope we attack 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.610
 then i have in berlin 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.360
 a little something for my hair 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.890
 bought and once difficult so 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 a lot of things to hold again if 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.759
 we super da silva look where that was 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.659
 who have been trying for ages and 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.700
 I just bought it 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.940
 just because I stood in front of it and something 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.880
 what does not exist here I have with 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.630
 sources seen in the video 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.640
 has shown that it is the fun silver 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.360
 white effect detergent that is such a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.880
 liquid 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.620
 you mix with water and the scene something 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.000
 hair and there is a silver effect and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.130
 she showed it in the video and that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.880
 obviously works really well and 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.070
 that's why I really wanted it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.160
 However, there is something to try out 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.830
 also only said in the east and soya berlin 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.310
 Berlin searched for it I have it 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.120
 actually found only in dm 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.350
 east part of the city 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.390
 What surprised me about everyone 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.180

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.130

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.650
 I still have that here 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.150
 bought that number seven that 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.090

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.890
 with white patchouli and cedar 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.390
 and that is totally son of one 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.660
 scent direction I stand on today 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.070
 probably and a bit smoky and stuff like that 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.460
 I smoke it is not that it is 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.740
 already pretty sweet but after 20 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.860
 in minutes the woody comes 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.420
 a bit darker, a bit darker 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.520
 and he is not that easy anymore 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.750
 aquatic in the beginning so a bit 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.740
 he is still nonsense 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.120
 but I love that and yes that 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.320
 improvements in richards has me 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.240

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.550

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.709
 Although it is once the color 37 and 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.930

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.050

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.940
 from kiko market but the stuff i have 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.680
 actually like and that's why I thought 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.470
 try it, especially because I have one 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.500
 we had a little more credit 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.150
 you wanted as 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.830
 I can still use it well 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.530
 What good mats knows their good 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.920

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.180
 euro costs like the ports of about if 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.490
 that could leave me there 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.320
 then it's time for 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.240
 assortment conversion and I have from 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.070

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.650
 went out and eat two 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.560
 things that are on the arrivals and 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.930
 Although I have the patrice once 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.530

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.230
 Pietsch Frappuccino is just totally wide 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.400

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.410
 already very excited I have not yet

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.080
