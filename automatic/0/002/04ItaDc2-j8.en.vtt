00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
separately this this is the first day

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.270 
separately this this is the first day
for<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> setup<00:00:44.989> just<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.680> make<00:00:46.860> sure<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
for the setup just to make sure the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.660 
for the setup just to make sure the
female<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:49.250> some<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> figure<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
female has some time to figure out the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.510 
female has some time to figure out the
the<00:00:53.670> aquascape<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.719> find<00:00:55.110> hiding<00:00:55.800> spot<00:00:56.309> in

didn't say that before and this is the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.289 
didn't say that before and this is the
setup<00:01:32.909> where<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> female<00:01:35.299> she's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

good<00:01:39.590> she's<00:01:40.590> trying<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> figure<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.990> hiding

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
good she's trying to figure out hiding

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
good she's trying to figure out hiding
spots<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:45.380> put<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> last<00:01:46.950> night<00:01:47.250> because

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
spots I put them in last night because

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.780 
spots I put them in last night because
it<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:47.909> hard<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.649> would<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.770> hard<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> catch

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it was hard to would be hard to catch

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.880 
it was hard to would be hard to catch
these<00:01:51.030> guys<00:01:52.759> during<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.030> day<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.890> catch

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
these guys during the day so I catch

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
these guys during the day so I catch
them<00:01:56.130> last<00:01:56.399> night<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.820> put<00:01:57.030> them<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
them last night and put them in in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.090 
them last night and put them in in the
morning<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.369> were<00:02:00.530> right<00:02:01.530> next<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> each

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
morning they were right next to each

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.060 
morning they were right next to each
other<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.840> close<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> glass<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.770> left

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
other and close to the glass on the left

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.809 
other and close to the glass on the left
and<00:02:05.369> right<00:02:05.399> set<00:02:06.119> right<00:02:06.570> side<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> tanks<00:02:07.819> so

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and right set right side of the tanks so

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.420 
and right set right side of the tanks so
I<00:02:09.209> guess<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:09.929> will

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I guess they will

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.470 
I guess they will
they<00:02:12.430> will<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.790> each<00:02:12.820> other<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.480> breed<00:02:13.750> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
they will like each other and breed I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.040 
they will like each other and breed I
have<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:18.100> one<00:02:18.690> here<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.050 
see here the right one with the female
is<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.150> will<00:02:22.300> be<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> breeding<00:02:23.050> tank<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:25.030> you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
is it will be the breeding tank as you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.510 
is it will be the breeding tank as you
can<00:02:25.390> see<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.660> have<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.960> mix<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:27.270> plastic<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.520> live

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520

can see I have a mix of plastic and live
plants<00:02:31.240> on<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:33.070> left<00:02:33.310> side<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:33.880> going<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.300> be

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
plants on the left side it's going to be

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.130 
plants on the left side it's going to be
the<00:02:34.690> hiding<00:02:36.209> area<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> tank<00:02:37.810> for<00:02:38.110> the

the<00:03:33.130> breeding<00:03:33.310> tank<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:38.650> a

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
the breeding tank I have just just a

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:47.340 
the breeding tank I have just just a
sponge<00:03:39.250> filter<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.940> see<00:03:43.660> they<00:03:43.870> kind<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:46.350> kind

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
sponge filter so see they kind of kind

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.690 
sponge filter so see they kind of kind
of<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.829> each<00:03:48.070> other<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.900> don't<00:03:49.900> have<00:03:50.700> top

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
of like each other I don't have top

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.750 
of like each other I don't have top
movement<00:03:52.390> almost<00:03:53.230> at<00:03:53.410> all<00:03:53.440> only<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> little<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
movement almost at all only a little a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.620 
movement almost at all only a little a
little<00:03:55.299> bit<00:03:55.450> on<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.750> left<00:03:55.900> side<00:03:56.260> I<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:01.450> I

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
little bit on the left side I think I

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.770 
little bit on the left side I think I
could<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:01.959> put<00:04:02.200> them<00:04:02.350> together<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.750> same

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
could have put them together in the same

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.940 
could have put them together in the same
tank<00:04:05.290> from<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.560> beginning<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.840> wanted<00:04:08.799> to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.740 
tank from the beginning I just wanted to
give<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.340> female<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> bit<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.180> time<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.570> get

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
give the female a bit of time to get

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.970 
give the female a bit of time to get
used<00:04:11.019> with<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:12.900> with<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.079> landscape<00:04:14.769> around
