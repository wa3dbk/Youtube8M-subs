know<00:02:37.680> bit<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:37.950> thinking<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.370> thought<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
know bit of thinking and thought that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.910 
know bit of thinking and thought that
maybe<00:02:38.990> they<00:02:39.990> weren't<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.470> pick<00:02:40.620> him<00:02:40.770> up

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
maybe they weren't going to pick him up

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.760 
maybe they weren't going to pick him up
and<00:02:41.480> wait<00:02:42.480> until<00:02:42.600> Anaheim<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> think

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
and wait until Anaheim but I think

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.460 
and wait until Anaheim but I think
they'll<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:44.070> silly<00:02:44.370> because<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:46.260> amount

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
they'll be silly because then the amount

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960 
they'll be silly because then the amount
of<00:02:46.530> hate<00:02:46.710> they'll<00:02:47.010> get<00:02:47.250> until<00:02:47.580> now<00:02:47.700> actually

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
of hate they'll get until now actually
