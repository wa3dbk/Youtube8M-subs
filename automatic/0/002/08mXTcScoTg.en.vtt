00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.410
 Brother 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.430
 It is a movie of the director of the colored osteopathic clinic that is doing tailoring in Kurume city 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.610
 This time it is quick without muscle sports 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.590
 I will follow the way I take it myself 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:24.650
 It complicated by muscle pain in particular by excessive use of exercise over youth 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.310
 If you continue exercising in this condition, you will be more likely to get injured , somehow manage to do it yourself 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.430
 Cah 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.060
 Because you can do it 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.060
 Please go to this opportunity and I will do it 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:46.710
 So we are doing about how to resolve the 2 on their own to gold 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:52.860
 First of all, if you sleep on your back and your thighs and knees become muscle ache well, first make your painful leg down 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.329
 I felt like this and slowly moving my lower feet that night 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.329
 I will shake it 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.680
 And the upper leg 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.840
 Try to move with the blanc in this way 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.840
 Roughly make about 30 seconds 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.780
 The behavior that has emerged in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780
 Do 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.510
 Then the opposite is the same feeling 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.110
 Operation 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.250
 Do about 30 seconds 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 And foot 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.390
 In this way 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.390
 Please shake and go for about 30 seconds again 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:54.380
 The second method is this time if this foot has muscle pain 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.380
 Slowly shape your muscles like this 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 In this way or a little twist 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.580
 Shake the muscles to make them rotate 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.460
 In the center of the child and particularly feel the tension of the muscle pain 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.460
 I do it like this 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.240
 And while having a painful cousin 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.920
 I want the range to stretch the knee 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.470
 The or fried or stretched 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.250
 Please see stretching and frying 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.510
 Even if your hands hurt, the front and back are 3 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.280
 I bend and stretch like this 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.310
 After that I am a little sleep 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.130
 In such a form 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.690
 It is okay to shake your foot 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 My blood flow is better and my pain is faster 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.400
 I'm missing 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.239
 If you want to do the same funukiri muscle 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.239
 Such a form 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.440
 Completely 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.420
 Ruler water 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:13.220
 If pain to do or looking for a strong first gently 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:17.210
 I will go to Chiba Chiba and will gradually increase 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.230
 And What will be hot because also in this 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.000
 Up and down 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.810
 I will flow 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 In the case of the rest, while holding here 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.290
 Ankle 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.630
 Raise and lower 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.560
 In the case of thighs, knees were bent or stretched 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.890
 I want to lower or raise the ankle in the case of about 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.850
 In this way 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.810
 Please try it 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:49.770
 As a rule of thumb, the number should be as good as the lightness of the muscles. 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.770
 Please be so 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:59.200
 It reported How was today try Yes 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:06.400
 How to get a muscle ache on your own Please go on this occasion 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.870
 The ability to do the next sport smoothly, especially by doing every time before muscle fatigue builds up 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.879
 I think 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.879
 Thank you for always seeing
