 If you say that is something 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.930

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.470
 Do not occur 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:13.260
 I think it might be happening, but I wonder if I can't keep up 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:21.120
 If I think I can't do anything at the meeting place, if I check it on the net again 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:28.260

 It came in album artwork 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:20.580
 Yes I was able to reflect one original album artwork 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:26.340
 Do It This is also this something quite unstable way it is a word that say Unstable 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:29.360
 It may be service or virtual, but sometimes it does not go well with one shot 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:34.580
 If I do it twice, I'm sorry 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.900
 But it was unstable so still that I wish whether there is the little bit like a system pub 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.009
 I feel 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.030
 Well though such the I'm a measured're saying through it one by one nice little in 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:46.440

 So 8 album art this time itunes match the album 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:07:00.080
