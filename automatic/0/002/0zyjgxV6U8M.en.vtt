 agreeably well today we get 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.960
 found for the first episode of the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.970
 new series that is a whole 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.260
 history of trees on the case 12 so 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.849
 first assault rifle requires 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.070
 I will explain in another video in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.089
 what does this series consist all along 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.230
 episodes 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.550
 I just want to say it's a 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 series that is for beginners as 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.039
 for experienced players 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.390
 I also want to thank all 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.410
 nobody will they see this video on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 a community channel and who 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.189
 will come who will come on my channel 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 comment or lacquer it makes me 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.640
 extremely pleasure without further ado and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.260
 I will wish you a pleasant 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.650
 watching and then I'll tell you to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.650
 immediately 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.680
 and here we are, as I am 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.630
 has said previously for a whole 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.490
 history of weapons on the case 12 which is 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.650
 in passing that I tell you my rifle 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.059
 Assault therefore prefer already know 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.620
 that it's an assault rifle 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.780
 unlock from the beginning so who will please 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.220
 to a maximum of people it is very 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.180
 nice even when we pass the prestige 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.650
 to have a son ensures that we unlock 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.660
 from the beginning but also know that 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.979
 his baseball count is 30 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.140
 which is really nice for a 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.520
 son of soultz who even sworn normal but 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 that his reload time and two 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.760
 seconds which places it into very 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.050
 good position two seconds without 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.940
 use of particular techniques 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.530
 to change the techniques by calling 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.270
 double because and others so that's what 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.100
 which also classifies him in the times of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.720
 rather fast reloading of rifles 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.220
 assault 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.380
 I also noted a positive point and a 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.360
 negative point of tears that I count 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.410
 tell you to have you all 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.580
 the cards in hand to know if yes or 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.530
 no, you plan to play with this weapon 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.390
 so already the positive point that I noted 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.979
 and its mobility is more dassault which has 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.660
 the best mobility in its category 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.790
 already I'm going to explain to you that the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.680
 mobility and moving more 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.759
 quickly aiming example machine guns 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.990
 we move faster by aiming that 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.430
 assault rifles it's not the fact 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.899
 whether it is lighter or other 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.680
 that I really want to sign because he 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.319
 are there really people who say 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.990
 anything on the forums so that 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.390
 can mislead a lot so the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.800
 to move faster by aiming 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 and that's very important because I 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 wanted to get into the video the point 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.480
 negative is a negative point for 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.459
 people I would say I would call 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.690
 good players but in quotes 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.010
 which can be a positive point for the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.200
 beginners and his rate of fire 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.959
 that I find a little slow but it's 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.250
 normal for the duels had one because 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.390
 that I am a player who plays since 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.099
 long a call of duty but for 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.069
 someone who starts it will be a 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.690
 rate of fire rather pleasant I 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.520
 also advise all the time three 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.110
 accessories in this series for that 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.340
 sticks best with your style of play 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.870
 like that if you prefer to play that with 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.610
 two accessories you do not hear you 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.990
 lift 1 and if you are looking to have 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.630
 three accessories you'll have the three 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.680
 I recommend the first the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.420
 first accessories that I you 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 advise are more for people 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.930
 who know how to play in quotation marks like 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.490
 I told you so and the second is 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.870
 more for people who would start because 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.950
 we have all been goals in a day and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.300
 it's always practical to have 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.620
 advice when we start and we 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.190
 seeks to improve 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.599
 so the first fashion that I advise 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.099
 is a word that I use first I 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.840
 advises cross to take advantage of the 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.580
 mobility of the tree spring that the crisis 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.930
 increases your mobility by 2 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.760
 the armada 12 that we move to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.230
 fourteen but it's also thanks to that 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.150
 that we will win all of us kill because 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.470
 we will move faster by targeting 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.959
 therefore advise you to put your 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.489
 viewfinder roughly at the torso level or 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.840
 of your opponent's head and 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.000
 to adjust your shoot in you from 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.230
 placements by moving you sorry for 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.299
 right on the left uses the technique 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.340
 is not not hunted as I say 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.510
 because it helps to destabilize 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.430
 your opponent so you go more 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.440
 easily won your duel 2 you go 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.940
 adjust faster than if you 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.620
 stay planted like a picket and that 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.150
 you have to adjust the camera here 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.980
 it is a technique that I advise and 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.209
 that if you make a habit of using 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.720
 you are going fast 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.980
 8 improve your wind in your news 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.780
 in the second I advise dagger group 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.640
 because the army has a lot of 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.879
 precision I rather advise of visible 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.769
 quickly it's more pleasant than little 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.629
 increased its accuracy for someone who 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.909
 know I can not tense in third 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.079
 I advise charge 1.24 because it's 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.880
 the third accessory that sticks the 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.989
 better with tears because the more we have 2 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.180
 bal plus we will be able to chain the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.200
 half turns often does not need to 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.269
 a lot of balls to chain a 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.099
 second a third and a half charge 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.139
 24 adds 15 balls so we go 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.730
 from 30 to 45 which is not negligible 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.560
 no longer because 50 bullets in a 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.859
 charger and then usually the more we have 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.710
 2 ball 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.330
 more is nice 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.780
 the second mode that I advise is a 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.170
 mod for people who would like to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.760
 researcher to have a better 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.740
 precision we were struggling with the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.060
 basic viewfinder for example it's 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.560
 really a way to have accuracy 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.210
 on long games and who wants 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.920
 really who will really be nice 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.630
 for that so first I advise 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.520
 laser sight for those who do not like the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.990
 basic viewfinder that can be replaced 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.670
 by lacrosse because from afar he's 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.710
 true that with a better than the viewfinder 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.300
 basic have little trouble seeing it 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.500
 the enemy nieuwbourg others so I 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.110
 advise the laser sight for people 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.240
 which would start or autofocus finder that 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.890
 is even better for for really 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.500
 adjust his opponent for really 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.760
 to have seen from afar for for people 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.010
 that started for people who 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.200
 start is a second I 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.790
 advises hand guard takes place and the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.930
 front handle what are we going to have 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.790
 better accuracy 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.290
 we will not aim faster we will lose 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.820
 this bonus but we're going to have a 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.600
 better accuracy and by far that's 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.980
 very pleasant 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.840
 we will have a lot less hindsight 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.920
 also on tears what is normal for 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.190
 people who would have trouble with the little 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.720
 back what to his property and in 3rd I 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.940
 silent advise that helps 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.620
 which will increase our our order to 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.150
 box our precision since we will 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.100
 lose that flame effect that are in 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.350
 any case no and so we will have less 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.900
 of necessity, but the 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.540
 problem was that gets removed from wearing 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.990
 baz luhrmann 9 and u2 removes so we 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.000
 passed one passes to basic cannon tears to 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.190
 12 to forgive is removed 2 so we 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.070
 will go to 10 range so I was holding 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.830
 to you emphasize it and for the stadiums 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.570
 precision of baz luhrmann 9 in tears 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.650
 but the guard gives two it makes 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.690
 we go to 11 so that's it 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.730
 really a way to be precise of 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.530
 far be aware that I advise this 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.180
 weapon also on the medium long map 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.010
 avoid small maps to the cause of his 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.780
 rate of fire as for example on 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.520
 the on the image that appears right there 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.710
 I advise playing with this weapon 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.120
 in the green zone and play some 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.580
 advice this weapon in the red zone 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.680
 so that's all that's 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.270
 long one shoote actually because or 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.710
 otherwise if you go to melee 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.970
 with an assault rifle you go fast 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.620
 you make boxes and against a smg 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.870
 must know that I recommend this weapon 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.690
 on such maps as biolab 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.570
 defendants horizon instinct recovery 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.670
 uni solar riot that are my board 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.690
 August I do not count the maps of the dlc 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.130
 because they are not yet out 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.240
 then the video choice but it's 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.479
 especially that not everyone has them 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.690
 and knowing that the tutorial will touch his 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.580
 end 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.960
 I would like you to feel 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.250
 what you tell me what you have 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.500
 thought on the video tell me if you 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.780
 did it help you a good friend 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.300
 would start on this month I'll tell you 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.039
 it's bad and not too bad at the next 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.240
 and we end up for episode 2 on 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.240
 which five go bye
