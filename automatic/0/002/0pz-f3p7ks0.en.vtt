idea how to make it
the<00:00:55.230> first<00:00:55.500> step<00:00:55.820> we<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.480> put<00:00:57.739> 4<00:00:58.820> beads

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the first step we need to put 4 beads

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.100 
the first step we need to put 4 beads
and<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:01.410> always<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.879> left<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and I always put in the left side of the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:14.230 
and I always put in the left side of the
line<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:06.080> first<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.520> yellow<00:01:10.580> second<00:01:11.840> purple

crystal clear and black put together

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.140 
crystal clear and black put together
both<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.470> even<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.189> after

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
both in to make even like this and after

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.499 
both in to make even like this and after
that<00:01:27.509> make<00:01:28.380> circle<00:01:29.540> by<00:01:30.540> putting<00:01:31.070> right<00:01:32.070> in

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
that make circle by putting right in

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
that make circle by putting right in
into<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> last<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:36.619> now<00:01:37.759> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
into the last bit which is back now you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.310 
into the last bit which is back now you
will<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> first<00:01:40.340> circle<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.579> first

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
will see the first circle or the first

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.310 
will see the first circle or the first
square<00:01:43.909> now<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:47.790> already<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.659> one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
square now you see you already have one

so<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.500> need<00:01:52.680> another<00:01:52.860> three<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.180> make<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> four

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so we need another three to make it four

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.080 
so we need another three to make it four
or<00:01:55.670> make<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> square<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:59.180> put<00:02:00.890> green

Indian<00:03:53.550> bread<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.090> next<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:55.070> super<00:03:56.070> crystal

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
Indian bread is next to super crystal

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.680 
Indian bread is next to super crystal
clear<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.660> also<00:03:58.250> green<00:03:59.250> next<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.940> crystal

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
clear and also green next to crystal

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.550 
clear and also green next to crystal
clear<00:04:00.890> now<00:04:02.360> this<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> little<00:04:04.050> bit<00:04:04.170> different

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
clear now this is a little bit different

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.949 
clear now this is a little bit different
from<00:04:04.680> other<00:04:04.950> part<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.560> put<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:09.480> other<00:04:09.660> in

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
from other part so we put the other in

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:19.640 
from other part so we put the other in
in<00:04:11.330> crystal<00:04:12.330> Korea<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.870> also<00:04:13.820> in<00:04:16.489> green<00:04:18.650> now

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
in crystal Korea and also in green now

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.900 
in crystal Korea and also in green now
you<00:04:19.709> will<00:04:20.190> see<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.430> we<00:04:21.299> have<00:04:21.650> three<00:04:22.650> beads<00:04:23.220> in

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
you will see that we have three beads in

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.530 
you will see that we have three beads in
the<00:04:24.270> line<00:04:24.480> so<00:04:24.840> we<00:04:25.470> need<00:04:26.160> only<00:04:26.640> one<00:04:26.910> more<00:04:27.210> to

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
the line so we need only one more to

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.640 
the line so we need only one more to
make<00:04:27.720> four<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.870> we<00:04:31.140> put<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.500> last<00:04:31.710> one<00:04:31.919> in

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
make four so we put the last one in

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.080 
make four so we put the last one in
which<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.830> like<00:04:35.100> light<00:04:36.030> blue<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.550> again<00:04:38.550> make

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
which is like light blue and again make

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.430 
which is like light blue and again make
circle<00:04:40.040> put<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.220> right<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.700> into<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:43.169> last

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
circle put the right in into the last

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.500 
circle put the right in into the last
bead<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.030> now<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:46.010> finished<00:04:47.010> off<00:04:47.510> the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
bead and now this is finished off the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.310 
bead and now this is finished off the
square<00:04:49.080> crystal<00:04:49.560> ball<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.820> will<00:04:51.000> also

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
square crystal ball and you will also

see<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.669> every<00:04:53.669> side<00:04:54.740> every<00:04:55.740> side<00:04:55.979> of<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
see that every side every side of the

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.750 
see that every side every side of the
ball<00:04:56.669> has<00:04:57.140> four<00:04:58.140> beats<00:04:59.419> now<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:02.510> basic<00:05:03.510> 101

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760
