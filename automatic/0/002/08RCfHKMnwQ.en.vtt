00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
one of the top charted games that came

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.679 
one of the top charted games that came
out<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> few<00:00:18.600> days<00:00:18.900> watch<00:00:19.560> dogs<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.689> the

traveler was also released a few days

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670 
traveler was also released a few days
after<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.750> reason<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.289> being

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
after it and the reason for that being

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500 
after it and the reason for that being
is<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.670> game<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:26.849> having<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
is because the game was having a lot of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.650 
is because the game was having a lot of
issues<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> previous<00:00:28.980> driver<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:30.449> was

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
issues with the previous driver it was

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
issues with the previous driver it was
in<00:00:30.810> stable<00:00:31.019> losing<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> lot<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.040> frames<00:00:32.399> while

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
in stable losing a lot of frames while

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729

soon<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:55.649> changed<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> high<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> ultra<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
soon as i changed it high and ultra a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.470 
soon as i changed it high and ultra a
lost<00:00:57.870> significant<00:00:58.469> frames<00:00:58.739> ultra<00:00:59.390> lidded<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
lost significant frames ultra lidded the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.830 
lost significant frames ultra lidded the
frames<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.960> dropped<00:01:01.230> around<00:01:01.410> 15<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.840> 13

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
frames it dropped around 15 to 13

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
frames it dropped around 15 to 13
minimum<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> 18<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.369> height<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.939> average

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
minimum and 18 at that height so average

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
minimum and 18 at that height so average
frame<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:06.900> 16<00:01:07.290> frames<00:01:07.830> per<00:01:08.100> second<00:01:08.460> which

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
frame about 16 frames per second which

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
frame about 16 frames per second which
was<00:01:08.729> highly<00:01:08.970> unplayable<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.549> therefore<00:01:12.020> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
was highly unplayable and therefore this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.160 
was highly unplayable and therefore this
driver<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:14.130> intended<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.780> improve<00:01:15.780> all

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
driver was was intended to improve all

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
driver was was intended to improve all
those<00:01:16.350> issues<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> probably<00:01:17.280> able<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
those issues so will be probably able to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.600 
those issues so will be probably able to
hit<00:01:17.880> around<00:01:18.570> maybe<00:01:18.780> 25<00:01:19.290> 24<00:01:19.890> knoll<00:01:20.130> trail<00:01:20.340> with

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
hit around maybe 25 24 knoll trail with

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
hit around maybe 25 24 knoll trail with
this<00:01:20.729> driver<00:01:21.000> i<00:01:21.299> believe<00:01:21.900> i<00:01:22.080> mean<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
this driver i believe i mean are the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
this driver i believe i mean are the
only<00:01:23.070> only<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.909> able<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> run<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> game

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
only only way I was able to run the game

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
only only way I was able to run the game
are<00:01:25.159> was<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.490> custom<00:01:26.880> settings<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> i

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are was with some custom settings that i

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.249 
are was with some custom settings that i
personally<00:01:28.909> set<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> game<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.780> run<00:01:31.140> an

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
personally set for the game to run an

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
personally set for the game to run an
over<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.100> playable<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
over for it to be playable now one of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 
over for it to be playable now one of
the<00:01:33.600> best<00:01:33.810> graphics<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.850> go

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the best graphics out of it so if you go

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.510 
the best graphics out of it so if you go
to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> display<00:01:36.560> settings<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.770> game<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
to the display settings in the game you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
to the display settings in the game you
would<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> I've<00:01:39.119> set<00:01:39.420> mine<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.900> these

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
would see that I've set mine to these

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.020 
would see that I've set mine to these
settings<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.159> where<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
settings of the here where we have the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
settings of the here where we have the
textures<00:01:45.030> set<00:01:45.270> ultra<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:45.899> said<00:01:46.170> three<00:01:46.409> gigs

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
textures set ultra now said three gigs

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
textures set ultra now said three gigs
of<00:01:46.799> memory<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.520> graphic<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.060> only<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.450> two

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of memory for graphic are only have two

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
of memory for graphic are only have two
gates<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.110> reckon<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.530> getting<00:01:49.710> backed

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
gates but I reckon it's getting backed

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
gates but I reckon it's getting backed
up<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.340> my<00:01:50.540> around<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.689> 16<00:01:52.079> gigs<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
up for my around with 16 gigs that

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
up for my around with 16 gigs that
that's<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> helping<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that's kind of helping this out and the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
that's kind of helping this out and the

performance drop with the previous

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.220 
performance drop with the previous

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
probably improve with this current

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.100 
probably improve with this current
