00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.430
 have a lot of time here in the pan like this 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.979

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.260

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.760

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.470
 and nothing else we would lack the dressing 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.110
 that would be the sauce since we're going 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.110
 to go then handing over 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.090
 already be that taste of the person I am 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.670
 the salad does not have oil or 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.070
 salt because obviously the yogurt sauce 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.470
 has all our students does not have it 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.770
 he says he has salt then this is the one that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.490
 the dressing adds to our 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.490
 salad
