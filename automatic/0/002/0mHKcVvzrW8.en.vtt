00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.329
 ordinary people I want to play a game 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.059
 for the next six minutes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.119
 Ivanovoy site strict in.ru will and not 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.819
 tell and you will look and 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:21.949
 listen 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.640
 are you ready to spend 46 minutes of your 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.269
 invaluable life championship in South Africa 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.470
 look don't look 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 it's up to you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.290
 hello live with tafga dot pv and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.270
 Volodya off-screen and let's talk our 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.270
 address of authority 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630
 and still dear assembly room 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.810
 we'll talk and akimovsky heard 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.900
 In other words, the film where a bunch of stupid 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.170
 youth in pursuit of that unity rushes 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.200
 on the remote lakes abandoned children 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.559
 camp in some sort of house in the woods 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250
 and behind them will certainly begin to hunt every 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.540
 they are yak paranormal 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.509
 entities or radioactive 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.829
 mutants it is also called youth 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.710
 choir because compulsory 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.369
 an attribute of such a movie are in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.759
 rural 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.770
 he will be predominantly 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.760
 young audience 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.280
 yes and all these parties of this system however in 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.420
 recent years hashayat around this kind 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.840
 films down the street 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.980
 especially after a hut in the woods and 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.170
 killing holidays by and large di 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.390
 constructed the genre first arose and then 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.060
 personal in all respects island 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.870
 crankcase 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.930
 then 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.170
 Well, or rather now it comes out very 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.680
 a good remake of 3 km but we live the end 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.450
 August when antill comes out 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.320
 First I want to note that this is not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.369
 first attempt to hammer youth 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.560
 gate in the game 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.360
 up to our today's 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.200
 the patient tried to do this 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.090
 dilogy obscure 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.370
 however there was more classic 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.610
 sternly his choirs gimpu years 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.780
 while antel house is as fashionable 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.300
 now express 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.510
 kintso 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.590
 in other words, more part of the gameplay 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 is to look to the assessment and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.459
 make choices 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.260
 constantly go right or left 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.590
 scream or keep silent or stand 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.490
 run cheer buddy or 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.870
 on the contrary to insult at all we all know 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.109
 what they are 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.930
 the trick here is that the developers and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.389
 superman sergey sobisevich then any 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.799
 taken or not taken 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.029
 actions 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.819
 will have your quick history development code 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.659
 called this system offers 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.569
 Vovachki and say that 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.299
 besides, no one will take into account 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.769
 will tint correct and 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.179
 some wrong options 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.939
 flowers 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.280
 right or wrong 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.400
 how good or bad here at all 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.349
 will not be 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.099
 any choice gives a certain set 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.219
 consequences to predict which 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.919
 the player’s task is what he will do 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.700
 to lean and solely and his 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.010
 problem that is going to the right they 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.799
 to the left you can save the hero’s life but 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.290
 not the fact that he as a result of not 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.290
 quarrel with everyone in the world and not 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.950
 scares the rest of the game the most 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.559
 in a fit of rage 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.599
 I thought it out of my head and 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.139
 will such a game have no idea 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.379
 although the relationship system 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.629
 heroes promise 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.129
 and then of course I want to joke: they say who ate 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.680
 toyota will be remembered know overseas 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.260
 journalists blog ru which hands have reached 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.859
 side of the game version 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.149
 they say it really works 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.859
 let's see what happens in practice 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.010
 For some reason I am still skeptical 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.819
 on the other hand can technology 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.540
 finally really 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.049
 have grown to afford 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.439
 kandic-like hole 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.689
 the second half of the gameplay is walking 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.290
 on locations looking at 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.180
 items and other familiar to many 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.849
 adventure on the creek 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.009
 so we not only look to the estimate 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.759
 press the buttons to be 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.159
 In this respect, by the way, funny but with 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.529
 parties it seems that management in such 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.539
 moments which is very strange 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.699
 judging by how many players are forced 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.299
 waving my gamepad 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.760
 personally the impression is that this 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.240
 more suited to the train and noise stick 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.640
 and there is some logic in it 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.220
 the earlier project 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.960
 developed under the motley 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.620
 didn't plan on forcing 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.590
 okay make players acquire 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.630
 In high school controller however now she 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.300
 sang song 4 we saw is not required 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.450
 and how convenient it will be constantly 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.830
 to turn the gamepad 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.159
 controversial issue 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.649
 although it may still alternative 

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.599
 control layout will be 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.050
 nothing else supernatural 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.669
 tan people don't have to wait long 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.560
 graphics and animations are nice but 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.039
 imagination does not strike 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.479
 typical eight friends are sending 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.460
 in the winter for the weekend in the mountains of course 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.169
 find themselves cut off from 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.479
 civilizations and of course on them 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.699
 the hunt begins 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.249
 and of course there is a grim backstory about 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.009
 tom like a year ago these eight people 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.559
 humiliated his girlfriend in front of whose boyfriend 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:53.819
 she was in love 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.050
 because of what she is with her sister 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.650
 twin strongly ran away into the forest 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.400
 and no one else saw them 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.270
 there is something unusual in fact 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.910
 it's pretty hard to come up with none 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.699
 less to write off the plot component 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.749
 from accounts I do not recommend 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.789
 firstly antill house will have serial 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.409
 monolithic structure of the film due to which 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.719
 there are authors and you personally have a chance to reveal 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:17.479
 all the personal motives of each of the characters 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.889
 drop their secrets and secrets and the underworld 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.669
 in the second on the main and minor roles 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.170
 picked up some great young actors 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.650
 here pi handsome for gintovt believes Peter 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.500
 leader of 6 heroes and hellish life in Yakutsk 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.580
 healthy 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.470
 and this is Wednesday at the site of some optimism 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.120
 we will not have one main character 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.500
 we constantly have to play 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.160
 for days 100 for other characters who 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.949
 and the thing will turn out to be in everyones 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.110
 situations 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.580
 and actually who will survive this night and 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.830
 live till morning 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.530
 decide solely on both the player and his direct 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.219
 hands 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.479
 besides, can not but rejoice the fact that 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.119
 demonstrated videos clearly gives us 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:00.069
 understand what the inspiration authors 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.520
 fed from everywhere 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.750
 and from your in the old keiko version 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.039
 Friday the thirteenth of modern 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.610
 horror movie in paranormal dock 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.460
 phenomena 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.589
 and that is the most pleasant for me from the saw 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.449
 general place maniac very much 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.139
 reminds john cramer manners 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.399
 push the speech of the rights of the inhabitants die choice 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.270
 behind you 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.710
 and build all sorts of killing mechanism 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.080
 the main thing is that personally for me at the moment 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.889
 not to please this abundance of screen rf 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.379
 on the player constantly something falls 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.499
 something turns on the door turns off 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.699
 clap people who smoke 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.990
 I understand that the genre is lawless for 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.889
 barely enough legs like that too them 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:38.740
 lot 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.089
 when the atmosphere doesn’t fall 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:43.349
 but apparently the anti-theft walks on 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:44.929
 footsteps playing in the creation 

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:47.309
 interactive cinema however chose 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:49.669
 slightly different genre and what's important 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.779
 according to the Chuvash progenitors and 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:52.979
 contemporaries 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.120
 in paradise for us waiting for the game year breakthrough 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.529
 decades or something like that but there is 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.969
 hope for decent and gaming 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.039
 horror 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.369
 so or not owners without 4 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:06.550
 will be able to find out at the end of August 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.520
 of the year 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.650
 on this, I all remember that maniac 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.889
 gardener and yes meeting at the table
