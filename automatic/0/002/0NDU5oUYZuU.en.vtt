00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
of my sprouting technique it's a lot

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.490 
of my sprouting technique it's a lot
drier<00:00:21.550> here<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.690> actually<00:00:22.840> has<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.260> big

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.230 
usually in New York I soaked it in a
bowl<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.710> buckwheat<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:30.220> rinse<00:00:30.640> it<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.060> then<00:00:31.150> I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
bowl the buckwheat I rinse it and then I

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.119 
bowl the buckwheat I rinse it and then I
put<00:00:31.480> them<00:00:31.600> in<00:00:31.810> sprouting<00:00:32.349> bags<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:32.890> let<00:00:32.980> them

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
put them in sprouting bags and let them

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.520 
put them in sprouting bags and let them
drip<00:00:33.340> out<00:00:33.460> rinse<00:00:34.030> them<00:00:34.239> with<00:00:34.390> water<00:00:34.600> here

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
drip out rinse them with water here

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.650

of think of it when I'm home you can

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.840 
of think of it when I'm home you can
just<00:01:27.700> rinse<00:01:28.299> your<00:01:29.200> sprouts<00:01:29.619> directly<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
steamer like this they get saturated and

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
them right in the steamer and everything

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.319 
them right in the steamer and everything
will<00:01:42.460> drip<00:01:42.700> out<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.509> by<00:01:44.380> covering<00:01:44.710> them

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
will drip out and by covering them

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.569 
will drip out and by covering them
you're<00:01:46.329> keeping<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.290> moisture<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.369> there

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
you're keeping that moisture in there

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.100 
you're keeping that moisture in there
it's<00:01:48.729> almost<00:01:48.909> like<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> little<00:01:49.270> incubator<00:01:49.869> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
it's almost like a little incubator and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.319 
it's almost like a little incubator and
they<00:01:50.259> will<00:01:50.409> actually<00:01:50.829> sprout<00:01:51.220> much<00:01:51.820> faster

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
they will actually sprout much faster

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.569 
they will actually sprout much faster

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
do a lot of steps but basically it's

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.770 
do a lot of steps but basically it's
just<00:02:49.010> rinsing<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.580> soaking<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.360> rinsing

just rinsing and soaking and rinsing
again<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.680> not<00:02:51.800> too<00:02:52.040> bad

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
again so it's not too bad

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
to pour out so as you get the hang of

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.060 
to pour out so as you get the hang of
making<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.230> don't<00:04:09.410> really<00:04:09.590> have<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.890> use

honey but I love the sweetener because
it's<00:04:19.220> less<00:04:20.030> than<00:04:20.210> 10%<00:04:20.420> fructose<00:04:21.230> and<00:04:21.680> when<00:04:22.250> I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
it's less than 10% fructose and when I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.010 
it's less than 10% fructose and when I
use<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.550> liquid<00:04:22.790> sweetener<00:04:23.330> it's<00:04:23.600> my<00:04:23.780> go-to

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
made granola that way sometimes when

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.730 
made granola that way sometimes when
I've<00:05:15.860> been<00:05:16.750> traveling<00:05:17.750> around<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:18.050> movie<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.680> I

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
I've been traveling around a movie and I

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.040 
I've been traveling around a movie and I
don't<00:05:18.919> have<00:05:19.039> my<00:05:19.160> dehydrator<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:20.120> can

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
don't have my dehydrator you can

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.050 
don't have my dehydrator you can
definitely<00:05:21.380> do<00:05:21.500> that<00:05:21.530> as<00:05:21.740> well<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.729> then

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
definitely do that as well and then

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.350 
definitely do that as well and then
you're<00:05:23.210> just<00:05:23.389> going<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:24.789> move<00:05:25.789> it<00:05:25.940> onto<00:05:26.150> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
you're just going to move it onto the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.830 
you're just going to move it onto the
dehydrator<00:05:27.080> sheet<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.240> make<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.300> nice<00:05:29.570> flat

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
dehydrator sheet and make a nice flat

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.339 
dehydrator sheet and make a nice flat
layer<00:05:30.289> so<00:05:30.740> that<00:05:30.919> everything<00:05:31.400> dehydrates

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
layer so that everything dehydrates

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.029 
layer so that everything dehydrates
evenly<00:05:35.199> looks<00:05:36.199> like<00:05:36.349> we're<00:05:36.470> gonna<00:05:36.590> have<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.830> go

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
evenly looks like we're gonna have to go

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.529 
evenly looks like we're gonna have to go
to<00:05:37.099> two<00:05:37.430> trays<00:05:37.760> but<00:05:38.120> I'll<00:05:38.210> just<00:05:38.270> demonstrate

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
to two trays but I'll just demonstrate

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.430 
to two trays but I'll just demonstrate
this<00:05:39.050> one<00:05:39.490> making<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.610> nice<00:05:41.080> even<00:05:42.080> layer<00:05:42.380> all

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
this one making a nice even layer all

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.790 
this one making a nice even layer all
the<00:05:42.800> way<00:05:43.010> across<00:05:45.610> great<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:47.599> then<00:05:48.500> I'm<00:05:48.680> gonna

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
the way across great and then I'm gonna

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.760 
the way across great and then I'm gonna
go<00:05:49.159> over<00:05:49.340> here<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.580> pop<00:05:49.820> it<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:50.120> my<00:05:50.240> dehydrator

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
go over here and pop it in my dehydrator

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.029 
go over here and pop it in my dehydrator
in<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.919> back<00:05:52.099> of<00:05:52.250> my<00:05:52.370> kitchen<00:05:52.580> I<00:05:53.860> like<00:05:54.860> to

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
in the back of my kitchen I like to

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.399 
in the back of my kitchen I like to
dehydrate<00:05:55.699> usually<00:05:56.150> between<00:05:57.070> 105<00:05:58.070> and<00:05:58.210> 110

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
dehydrate usually between 105 and 110

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:06.189 
dehydrate usually between 105 and 110
degrees<00:06:01.120> push<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.330> in<00:06:04.330> overnight<00:06:05.330> you<00:06:06.169> know

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
degrees push that in overnight you know

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.080 
degrees push that in overnight you know
sometimes<00:06:06.979> it<00:06:07.099> just<00:06:07.130> depends<00:06:07.699> on<00:06:07.849> your

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
sometimes it just depends on your

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.279 
sometimes it just depends on your
climate<00:06:08.510> it<00:06:08.599> depends<00:06:08.960> on<00:06:08.990> your<00:06:09.139> dehydrator

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
climate it depends on your dehydrator

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.830 
climate it depends on your dehydrator
you<00:06:09.740> can<00:06:09.979> keep<00:06:10.159> changing<00:06:10.940> it<00:06:11.030> and<00:06:11.180> checking<00:06:11.389> it

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
you can keep changing it and checking it

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.390 
you can keep changing it and checking it
so<00:06:12.110> that<00:06:12.260> was<00:06:12.440> one<00:06:12.650> sheet<00:06:12.979> I'm<00:06:13.099> gonna<00:06:13.250> keep

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
so that was one sheet I'm gonna keep

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.790
