insides<00:04:17.700> are<00:04:17.880> different<00:04:18.180> wheels<00:04:19.170> are

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
insides are different wheels are

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.470 
insides are different wheels are
different<00:04:19.769> apart<00:04:20.459> from<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.760> classic<00:04:21.150> models

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
different apart from the classic models

affect<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.780> wheel<00:04:21.959> trends<00:04:22.290> remain<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> same

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
affect the wheel trends remain the same

affect the wheel trends remain the same
but<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:24.060> an<00:04:24.180> elegance<00:04:24.510> we'd<00:04:24.750> have<00:04:24.870> to

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
but this is an elegance we'd have to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.870 
but this is an elegance we'd have to
wire<00:04:25.140> them<00:04:25.290> out<00:04:28.160> when<00:04:29.160> end<00:04:29.340> this<00:04:29.430> video<00:04:29.610> very

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
wire them out when end this video very

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.370 
wire them out when end this video very
shortly<00:04:30.240> as<00:04:30.570> I'm<00:04:30.720> going<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.990> do<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.170> third

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
shortly as I'm going to do the third

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.250 
shortly as I'm going to do the third
parts<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:31.800> video<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.690> second<00:04:34.140> and

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
parts of this video of the second and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.470 
parts of this video of the second and
third<00:04:34.320> parts<00:04:34.680> second<00:04:35.490> part<00:04:35.700> will<00:04:36.000> mostly<00:04:36.390> be

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
third parts second part will mostly be

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.290 
third parts second part will mostly be
looking<00:04:36.810> man<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:36.960> theory<00:04:37.430> so<00:04:38.430> please<00:04:38.790> do<00:04:39.000> stay

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
looking man in theory so please do stay

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.040 
looking man in theory so please do stay
tuned<00:04:39.510> for<00:04:39.690> more

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
tuned for more

tuned for more
I've<00:04:41.010> just<00:04:41.250> got<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.430> upload<00:04:41.730> this<00:04:41.820> video<00:04:41.970> and

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
I've just got to upload this video and

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.170 
I've just got to upload this video and
then<00:04:42.720> I'll<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:43.080> back<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.380> soon<00:04:43.410> as<00:04:43.530> possible
