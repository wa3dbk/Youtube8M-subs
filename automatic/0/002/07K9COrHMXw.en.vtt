rotors<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.349> you've<00:02:09.470> got<00:02:09.590> these<00:02:09.709> little<00:02:09.860> cuts

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
rotors so you've got these little cuts

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.940 
rotors so you've got these little cuts
here<00:02:10.489> in<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.670> rotor<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:12.440> those<00:02:12.650> are<00:02:12.830> to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
here in the rotor that just those are to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.100 
here in the rotor that just those are to
dissipate<00:02:13.400> more<00:02:13.430> heat<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:14.510> don't<00:02:14.690> just<00:02:14.930> look

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
dissipate more heat they don't just look

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.750

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.990 
has a hydraulic clutch
it's<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.440> radio<00:02:24.650> style<00:02:25.099> master<00:02:25.340> silver<00:02:25.819> which

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
it's a radio style master silver which

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.570 
it's a radio style master silver which
just<00:02:26.209> means<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.930> piston<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.489> is

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
just means that the piston in here is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.270 
just means that the piston in here is
moving<00:02:28.910> like<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.330> as<00:02:30.230> opposed<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.040> way

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
moving like this as opposed to this way

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.460 
moving like this as opposed to this way
a<00:02:31.580> lot<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.180> bikes<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.599> pull<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.989> lever<00:02:33.200> like

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
a lot of bikes you pull the lever like

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.250 
a lot of bikes you pull the lever like
this<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.790> pushing<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.510> piston<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.019> way<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
this and pushing a piston this way so

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.110 
this and pushing a piston this way so
this<00:02:36.620> way<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.920> piston<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.519> moving<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> same

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
this way the piston is moving the same

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.600 
this way the piston is moving the same
way<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.200> lever<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.310> gives<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.580> a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
way as the lever it just gives you a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.750 
way as the lever it just gives you a
better<00:02:40.790> feel<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:42.050> those<00:02:42.349> Pistons<00:02:43.160> not<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> huge

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
better feel on those Pistons not a huge

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.030 
better feel on those Pistons not a huge
plus<00:02:44.090> over<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.569> clutch<00:02:44.930> side<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
plus over the clutch side but on the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.330 
plus over the clutch side but on the
brake<00:02:46.340> side<00:02:46.610> really<00:02:46.970> gives<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> nice<00:02:47.660> feel

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
brake side really gives you a nice feel

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.650 
brake side really gives you a nice feel
great<00:02:49.340> instrumentation<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.420> thinks

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
great instrumentation really thinks

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.300 
great instrumentation really thinks
Kawasaki<00:02:51.170> tried<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> do<00:02:51.709> with<00:02:51.890> these<00:02:52.040> bikes

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
Kawasaki tried to do with these bikes

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.420 
Kawasaki tried to do with these bikes
was<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.849> dress<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:54.230> instrumentation<00:02:55.099> with

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
was to dress up the instrumentation with

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.270 
was to dress up the instrumentation with
them<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:55.640> you've<00:02:55.760> got<00:02:56.060> these<00:02:56.239> stainless<00:02:56.840> steel

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
them so you've got these stainless steel

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
them so you've got these stainless steel
rings<00:02:58.280> around<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.060> gauges<00:02:59.540> got<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> nice

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
rings around the gauges got a nice

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.839 
rings around the gauges got a nice
digital<00:03:00.530> display<00:03:00.829> this<00:03:00.950> bikes<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.400> serviced

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
digital display this bikes not serviced

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.130 
digital display this bikes not serviced
so<00:03:02.030> unfortunately<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.569> won't<00:03:02.690> be<00:03:02.810> able<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.989> turn

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
so unfortunately I won't be able to turn

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.110 
so unfortunately I won't be able to turn
it<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.380> but<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:04.459> gives<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.730> lot<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.940> really
