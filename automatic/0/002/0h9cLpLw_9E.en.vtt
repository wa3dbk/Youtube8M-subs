as finally worn out I was going to
patent<00:00:19.439> their<00:00:19.560> design<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.609> too

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
patent their design but it's too

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.090 
patent their design but it's too
expensive<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.720> too<00:00:21.840> little<00:00:22.080> returned<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.920> now

it the anvil on the other side has a

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.199 
it the anvil on the other side has a
valley<00:02:56.230> cut<00:02:56.560> into<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.040> when<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.880> area

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
valley cut into it when this area

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.479 
valley cut into it when this area
pinches<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.840> tubing<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.440> also<00:02:59.830> folds<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.280> bit

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
pinches the tubing it also folds a bit

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.540 
pinches the tubing it also folds a bit
which<00:03:00.730> creates<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.330> tighter<00:03:01.660> seal<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:03.190> anvil

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
which creates a tighter seal the anvil

which creates a tighter seal the anvil
rests<00:03:04.030> on<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.300> screw<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.560> move<00:03:05.709> around<00:03:05.890> a

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
rests on a screw so it can move around a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.250 
rests on a screw so it can move around a
bit<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.970> slider<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.450> anvil<00:03:07.810> will<00:03:07.930> always
