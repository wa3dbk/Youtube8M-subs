00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.980
 the best 3d printer as up to date and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 extensively tested in the chip 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 Best list for proud 2300 euro 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 get it with replicator 2 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.650
 extremely stable and great 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 3d printer also processed 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 the designer desk a good one 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.439
 figure makes that he while working 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 the interior with colored flashing leds 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.170
 can illuminate its underscores 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.939
 show character 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 the housing is made of a solid 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.439
 steel sheet frame built with 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.170
 Stable plastic plates are involved 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.450
 the guiding rod of the extruder of the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 The plastic heated consists of solid 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.840
 Steel rods in lubricated bushes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 are stored and almost no play 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.430
 have the replicator two 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 processed pr plastic on one 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.579
 big role behind the housing 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.739
 infected and by a 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 plastic hose supplied to the extruder 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.620
 becomes 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.809
 the minimum layer thickness is 0.1 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.399
 millimeter the pressure result and the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.160
 speed are total in 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.260
 order small objects such as the d-cadre 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 pressure of the replicator 2 in finest 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 stratification within two hours 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.500
 vertical walls is the layering 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.299
 clearly visible and perceptibly fine 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.439
 structures have grata and must 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 be reworked 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 the rank for safe 1000 is one 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.950
 complete printer a product of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 Konrad the printer is made of aluminum 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.650
 Steel and stainless steel share the pressure 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.369
 remains is already and changeable 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.430
 All common can be processed 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.979
 materials such as pa and abs 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.750
 a real highlight konrad wants in the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 next few months on sentences like one 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 milling machine and a laser offer 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.409
 print orders send via usb 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 directly to the rf 1000 or stuck one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.320
 sd card with the data in the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.390
 integrated card reader 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 via a display and a keypad 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.540
 Take corrections and settings 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 directly on the printer 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.439
 The result is impressive 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.880
 even surfaces are smooth and not so 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.630
 rough as with other printers too 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.020
 Filigree figures are printed neatly 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.329
 no pressure better the ultimate two 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 turns out in the test as currently best 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.920
 3d printer for home users thanks 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.930
 heated pressure plate and solid 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.630
 Construction sat down from the printer 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.940
 competition from the print quality of the high 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.959
 only with extremely filigree overhangs 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.150
 shows he is weakening 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.730
 Also in terms of equipment sat the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.519
 best value the printer uses as a filament 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.319
 both kÃ¶hler and abs um offers for 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.480
 Both materials in the included 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.640
 software corresponding default 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.470
 you can print them 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.989
 via the provided software cura 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.959
 can create and edit these 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.760
 Import common 3D cad formats and 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.250
 saves projects in the for the printer 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.190
 readable format starting with a highlight is the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.450
 community around the ultimate 2 case 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.620
 Once you have a problem with your printer 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.260
 you can find them in the appropriate 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.940
 help quickly there is also help 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 Hardly any other manufacturer 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.660
 more extensive database with new ones 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.660
 templates for 3d objects
