in<00:05:14.899> a<00:05:15.430> mortal<00:05:16.430> kombat<00:05:16.819> vs<00:05:17.120> DC<00:05:17.149> universe<00:05:17.509> that's

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
in a mortal kombat vs DC universe that's

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.170 
in a mortal kombat vs DC universe that's
the<00:05:18.289> only<00:05:18.469> time<00:05:18.649> but<00:05:18.949> he's<00:05:19.430> an<00:05:19.550> assassin<00:05:19.789> and

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
the only time but he's an assassin and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.629 
the only time but he's an assassin and
basically<00:05:20.779> what<00:05:21.439> this<00:05:21.649> is<00:05:21.710> about<00:05:22.009> this<00:05:22.399> game

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.670 
basically what this is about this game
is<00:05:22.969> even<00:05:23.419> though<00:05:23.509> it's<00:05:23.629> a<00:05:23.689> prequel<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:24.439> a<00:05:24.529> way

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
is even though it's a prequel in a way

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.769 
is even though it's a prequel in a way
it's<00:05:24.979> not<00:05:25.460> like<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.699> like<00:05:25.879> how<00:05:26.300> Arkham
