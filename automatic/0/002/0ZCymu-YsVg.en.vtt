00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:19.020 

at<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.650> four<00:01:03.040> speed<00:01:03.400> on<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.970> floor

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.060 

this<00:01:20.030> was<00:01:20.600> supposedly<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.259> very<00:01:21.320> fast<00:01:21.770> car

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
this was supposedly a very fast car

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.719 
this was supposedly a very fast car
because<00:01:22.609> the<00:01:22.789> engine<00:01:23.149> was<00:01:24.009> lighter<00:01:26.710> than<00:01:27.729> most

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
because the engine was lighter than most

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.389 
because the engine was lighter than most
at<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.270> time

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
at the time

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:45.730 
at the time
despite<00:01:31.399> its<00:01:32.229> cubic<00:01:33.229> inches

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:02:06.169 

I<00:01:45.829> like<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.700> color<00:01:46.939> very<00:01:47.840> nice

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.020 

looks<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.929> tack<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:09.920> by<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.030> manual

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
looks like a tack there by the manual

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:24.110 
looks like a tack there by the manual
shift<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.840> console

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.479 

so<00:02:24.780> give<00:02:25.050> me<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.500> impression<00:02:26.040> was<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.459> a

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
so give me your impression was this a

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.930 
so give me your impression was this a
true<00:02:26.879> grand<00:02:27.239> sport<00:02:27.569> or<00:02:27.780> not
