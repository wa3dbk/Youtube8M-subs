00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
cushion is cutout at the back so it's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.050 
cushion is cutout at the back so it's
easier<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.290> get<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.739> out<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.250> car<00:02:21.489> but

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
easier to get in and out of the car but

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.849 
easier to get in and out of the car but
there's<00:02:22.239> also<00:02:22.450> still<00:02:22.959> thigh<00:02:23.230> support<00:02:23.709> at<00:02:23.769> the

are<00:02:27.040> integrated<00:02:27.489> into<00:02:27.639> the<00:02:27.760> door<00:02:28.030> handles<00:02:28.569> so

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
are integrated into the door handles so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.150 
are integrated into the door handles so
that<00:02:28.870> all<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.139> have<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.349> do<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.680> push<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
that all you have to do is push the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.490 
that all you have to do is push the
handle<00:02:30.579> in<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.239> lock<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.599> doors<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.200> pull<00:02:32.380> the

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
handle out to unlock them and that gets

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.900 
handle out to unlock them and that gets
rid<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.620> an<00:02:35.769> extra<00:02:35.889> button<00:02:36.430> that'll<00:02:36.579> clutter

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
rid of an extra button that'll clutter

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.050 
rid of an extra button that'll clutter
up<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.120> interior<00:02:37.540> also<00:02:38.169> this<00:02:38.919> the<00:02:39.340> cupholders

the center console here it's very

thought-out

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.089 
thought-out
the<00:02:55.239> one<00:02:55.419> drawback<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.319> is<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.829> it's<00:02:56.980> a

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
the one drawback to it is that it's a

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.430 
the one drawback to it is that it's a
little<00:02:57.280> bit<00:02:57.519> too<00:02:57.819> streamlined<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.870> for

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
little bit too streamlined in that for

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.490 
little bit too streamlined in that for
instance<00:02:59.650> to<00:03:00.280> turn<00:03:00.549> off<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.389> climate<00:03:02.109> control

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
instance to turn off the climate control

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.930 
instance to turn off the climate control
instead<00:03:02.919> of<00:03:03.010> having<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.310> button<00:03:03.669> here<00:03:03.819> on<00:03:03.849> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
instead of having a button here on the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.150 
instead of having a button here on the
dashboard<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.959> have<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.590> go<00:03:05.709> into<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
dashboard you have to go into the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.030 
dashboard you have to go into the
climate<00:03:06.430> menu<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.470> click<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.500> button<00:03:08.709> over

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
climate menu and click the button over

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.430 
climate menu and click the button over
here<00:03:09.069> it's<00:03:09.790> just<00:03:09.849> one<00:03:10.209> extra<00:03:10.599> step<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.109> they

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
here it's just one extra step and they

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.050 
here it's just one extra step and they
did<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.889> the<00:03:11.950> sake<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.220> not<00:03:12.519> cluttering<00:03:12.940> up

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
did it for the sake of not cluttering up

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.960 
did it for the sake of not cluttering up
the<00:03:13.180> dashboard<00:03:13.419> with<00:03:13.930> buttons<00:03:14.549> now<00:03:15.549> one<00:03:15.790> thing

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
the dashboard with buttons now one thing

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
the dashboard with buttons now one thing
I<00:03:16.090> do<00:03:16.150> really<00:03:16.510> like<00:03:16.810> about<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.230> design<00:03:17.560> is

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
I do really like about the design is

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.500 
I do really like about the design is
that<00:03:17.889> there<00:03:18.069> is<00:03:18.160> an<00:03:18.280> on/off<00:03:18.519> switch<00:03:18.760> very

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
that there is an on/off switch very

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.629 
that there is an on/off switch very
prominent<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> screen<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.370> at

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
prominent for the screen so that at

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.099 
prominent for the screen so that at
night<00:03:21.669> when<00:03:22.120> there's<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.389> lot<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.629> glare<00:03:22.840> if

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
night when there's a lot of glare if

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.420 
night when there's a lot of glare if
you're<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> person<00:03:23.620> who<00:03:23.709> doesn't<00:03:23.739> like<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.310> have

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
you're a person who doesn't like to have

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.099 
you're a person who doesn't like to have
the<00:03:24.579> screen<00:03:24.819> always<00:03:25.000> on<00:03:25.209> it's<00:03:25.389> really<00:03:25.750> easy<00:03:25.959> to

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
the screen always on it's really easy to

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.430 
the screen always on it's really easy to
find<00:03:26.910> another<00:03:27.910> reason<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.450> controls<00:03:28.870> work<00:03:29.139> so

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
find another reason the controls work so

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.189 
find another reason the controls work so
well<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.489> Jaguar<00:03:30.789> did<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.389> great<00:03:31.840> job<00:03:31.870> of

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
well is that Jaguar did a great job of

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.439 
well is that Jaguar did a great job of
integrating<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:33.070> steering<00:03:33.789> wheel<00:03:33.940> controls

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
integrating the steering wheel controls

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.320 
integrating the steering wheel controls
so

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
so

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.760 
so
you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.600> manipulate<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:36.260> lot<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
you can manipulate a lot of the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.730 
you can manipulate a lot of the
functions<00:03:37.220> such<00:03:37.370> as<00:03:37.400> stereo<00:03:37.850> volume<00:03:38.740> channel

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
functions such as stereo volume channel

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.760 
functions such as stereo volume channel
selection<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.670> cruise<00:03:41.540> control<00:03:41.660> right<00:03:42.530> from

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
selection and cruise control right from

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.140 
selection and cruise control right from
