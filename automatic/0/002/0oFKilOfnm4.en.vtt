00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello everyone today at the request we will analyze 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.779
 song band gas sector 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.969
 I'm not drunk and not a drinker I'm in my own 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.700
 the key of A minor will play the verse 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.049
 salon and tell you in detail how that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.049
 play and so go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.390
 sadness and drunk and not a drinker I am vodka and but 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.910
 this is not my bastard me and bang out 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 You canâ€™t turn it on 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.350
 cool stab and google once doctors 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.699
 forbidden me to drink need cancer worth 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.820
 thought more expensive until our hemp after morning 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.820
 but 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.080
 but 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 but 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.359
 but 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.359
 but 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.750
 let's start with parsing brute force 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.470
 so playing like an example chord a 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:39.160
 minor am 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.160
 play you fifth string then 321 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.490
 and 2 and 3 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.570
 each finger to his country big 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.520
 index among 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.520
 and on 1 nameless 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 farther 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.310
 playing bass again 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.210
 and the same thumb we play and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.210
 fourth string 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.350
 just like that once we play 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.350
 the second time we play already 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.730
 again 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.380
 This is how we had a chord A.M. 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.090
 let's tell who else does not know how 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.120
 play these chords 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.550
 there are only three chords thieves chords 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.430
 for minor 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.960
 and m is taken so the first open 2 on 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 first palms 3 not 4 by 2 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.340
 bass string 5 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.090
 there is the next chord in E major will 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.270
 chord c right means take E major 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.950
 so the first second open 3 on the first 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.950
 palms 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.370
 4 5 on the second and little finger add 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 a touch of re sept war something on the third fret 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.209
 the bass is played 6 strings and the rest of the country 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.209
 the same 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.370
 understandable and the third final chord 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.180
 D Minor DM 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.000
 take so 1 for 1 daughters 2 on the third and 3 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.000
 on author bass string 4 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.510
 here we can play in a row 4 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.800
 strings 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.800
 after the second time 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.480
 play bass twice 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.660
 you can just play exactly 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.040
 and 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.420
 the difference will not be significant 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.420
 will be the solo we have played 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:15.540
 I'll show you on this guitar means 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:18.739
 first string 12 paws on 10 lats 8 and 2 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.739
 string on the tenth 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:30.890
 Then we play the first string 1210 8 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.530
 then the second string on the twelfth and 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.530
 third on 9 daughters 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:50.970
 clearly further play the first string 10 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.970
 87 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.480
 play 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.480
 ear world and 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:17.380
 and play the first string the last phrase 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.380
 10 875 let's slowly first 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.449
 Here we have a simple solo but 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:40.639
 beautiful so try everything with you of course 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.639
