perfume summer edition so it was like
the<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.980> round<00:02:33.250> bottle

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.850 

and<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:41.840> smells<00:02:42.140> different<00:02:42.560> from<00:02:42.710> this

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
and that one smells different from this

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.010 
and that one smells different from this
one<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:43.400> if<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.730> are<00:02:43.850> worried<00:02:44.210> about<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.480> it
