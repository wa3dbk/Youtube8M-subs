you toggle the wrong thing the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.610 
you toggle the wrong thing the
application<00:04:05.340> might<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:06.000> work<00:04:06.329> right<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.260> keep

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
application might not work right so keep

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.199 
application might not work right so keep
that<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.829> mind<00:04:07.950> it's<00:04:08.310> not<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.519> rom<00:04:08.760> issue<00:04:08.970> it's

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
that in mind it's not a rom issue it's

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.729 
that in mind it's not a rom issue it's
not<00:04:09.269> an<00:04:09.420> application<00:04:09.930> issue<00:04:10.049> it's<00:04:10.500> you

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
not an application issue it's you

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.800 
not an application issue it's you
probably<00:04:11.040> turn<00:04:11.250> something<00:04:11.549> off<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.660> app

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
probably turn something off that the app

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.050 
probably turn something off that the app
actually<00:04:13.109> needed<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:14.100> function<00:04:14.310> properly<00:04:14.609> so

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
actually needed to function properly so
