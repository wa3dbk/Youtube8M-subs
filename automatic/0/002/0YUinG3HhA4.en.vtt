00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
kind of thinking this might be the

kind of thinking this might be the
golden<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.150> colored

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
golden one just because it's colored

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
golden one just because it's colored
yellow<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> could<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
yellow but you know I could be

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.539 
yellow but you know I could be
completely<00:01:35.189> wrong

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
completely wrong

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.950 
completely wrong

it<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.970> best<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.540> stake<00:01:43.020> them<00:01:43.170> down

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it would be best to stake them down

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.080 
it would be best to stake them down
because<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.829> see<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.610> diameter<00:01:44.790> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
because you can see the diameter is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.899 
because you can see the diameter is
really<00:01:45.540> thin<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.470> small<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> they're

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
really thin or really small and they're

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
really thin or really small and they're
pretty<00:01:48.119> tall<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.600> other<00:01:48.720> words<00:01:48.899> inside<00:01:49.350> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
pretty tall in other words inside it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.440 
pretty tall in other words inside it's
probably<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.369> best<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.850> leave<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.240> by

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
probably not best just to leave it up by

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.139 
probably not best just to leave it up by
itself<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.920> ideally<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.490> cool<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
itself so it ideally be cool if you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.310 
itself so it ideally be cool if you
could<00:01:54.240> stake<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.140> did

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
could stake them and then if you did

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.389 
could stake them and then if you did
that<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> stake<00:01:55.860> them<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that you can stake them so on this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
that you can stake them so on this
fanned<00:01:56.759> straight<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.750> fanned<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> know

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
fanned straight up fanned or you know

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.590 
fanned straight up fanned or you know
whatever<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.159> several<00:02:00.000> fans<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> start

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
whatever have several fans so I start

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.490 
whatever have several fans so I start
with<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.930> way<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> could<00:02:01.259> probably

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
with in this way you could probably

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.760 
with in this way you could probably
create<00:02:01.740> some<00:02:02.070> pretty<00:02:02.219> cool<00:02:02.520> effects<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.770> it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
create some pretty cool effects so it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
create some pretty cool effects so it's
almost<00:02:04.950> dark<00:02:05.189> outside<00:02:05.399> we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> take

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
almost dark outside we're going to take

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.719 
almost dark outside we're going to take
these<00:02:06.719> two<00:02:06.780> outside<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> shoot<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.340> off<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
these two outside and shoot them off and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.160 
these two outside and shoot them off and
just<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.450> happens<00:02:09.840> then

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
just kind of see what happens then

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.300 
just kind of see what happens then
once<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.470> guys<00:02:10.590> let<00:02:10.860> me<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.220> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
once you guys let me know what you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.670 
once you guys let me know what you
thought<00:02:11.630> okay<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.660> went<00:02:12.959> ahead<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.260> supported

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
thought okay I went ahead and supported

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.530 
thought okay I went ahead and supported
the<00:02:13.830> minds<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.670> didn't<00:02:14.940> stick<00:02:15.090> them<00:02:15.209> down<00:02:15.239> we

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the minds I didn't stick them down we

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.030 
the minds I didn't stick them down we
just<00:02:15.569> put<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:15.900> inside<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.140> cinder<00:02:16.380> block<00:02:16.410> but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
just put them inside a cinder block but

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.170 
just put them inside a cinder block but
the<00:02:17.130> cinder<00:02:17.340> block<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.760> good<00:02:17.970> enough<00:02:18.120> that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the cinder block is good enough that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
the cinder block is good enough that
it's<00:02:18.599> not<00:02:18.720> going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.930> tip<00:02:19.080> over<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it's not going to tip over to be a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.589 
it's not going to tip over to be a
danger<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.160> anyone<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.760> went<00:02:21.150> ahead<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.390> put

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
danger to anyone I went ahead and put

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.030 
danger to anyone I went ahead and put
safety<00:02:21.989> fuse<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.440> because<00:02:22.709> I'm<00:02:22.860> out<00:02:22.950> here

and I'm going to hand light it and then

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.630 
and I'm going to hand light it and then
get<00:02:25.590> far<00:02:25.770> enough<00:02:25.830> back<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.489> still

the mine effect on the pyro predator one

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.449 
the mine effect on the pyro predator one
went<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.630> lot<00:03:21.930> higher<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.970> lot<00:03:23.970> higher<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:25.459> the

went a lot higher a lot higher and the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.979 
went a lot higher a lot higher and the

one that was incredible difference you

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.420 
one that was incredible difference you
know<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.170> was<00:03:37.380> really<00:03:37.680> expecting<00:03:38.010> them<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.310> be

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
know I was really expecting them to be

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:49.680 
know I was really expecting them to be
almost<00:03:38.760> identical<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:40.440> was<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.920> case
