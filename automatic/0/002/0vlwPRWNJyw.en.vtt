00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.990
 Hello, I 'm what you think. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.480
 We already talked about the main 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.580
 New android features the 5 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.740
 I'm in this cold weather 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.470
 Yes, they do not have the opportunity to see you. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.380
 be the link is in the description below so 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 to subscribe but an issue will still be 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.500
 that this new and faster version of the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 than the previous 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.439
 for that we pay in two grandchildren xingu 1 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.840
 with android 4.4 pickett and other with 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.180
 five to ibope and we open faults and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.800
 applications predict which god opens the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.780
 quickly 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.640
 both forums have official versions of the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.890
 android own terms so the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.500
 actual results and avoid failure 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.150
 some schools and also the extra weight of 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.580
 some masks that said or not 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.770
 cats work and we also had the 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.950
 care char all open applications 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.020
 in headphones to provide equal 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.360
 level on the fan and 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.980
 of memory and also for none 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.110
 advantage over the other, since 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.700
 we'll try to open an application already 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.650
 open in the background 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.760
 this will emerge much more quickly 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.760
 change the future 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.350
 also the publicity of the animations was 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.509
 changed in both to zero to five 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 sometimes does so because it is the most 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.310
 fast and this is a topic to be addressed 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.710
 a video of each venture with 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.740
 tips and hints to make it more 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.840
 fast because of the same headphones 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.789
 distance the river takes up or city 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.789
 internet does not influence the results 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.610
 and from what we see we can conclude that the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.920
 overall performance 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.229
 many people do, but we do 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.240
 slight difference and sometimes the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.009
 that got even faster and other 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.259
 I've read it because it opens the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.690
 applications but the trend is that each 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.490
 more is to be the pop Olympus more 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.560
 fast and it will be a matter of time until 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.840
 that the main applications designed 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.759
 in order to take from the new 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.539
 application execution system 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.580
 the art this system will occupy more ram 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.030
 will cause the applications to be 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.010
 even faster to open it is still 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.390
 more common times of the forum to have two 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.040
 or more of israel 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.660
 so it's good to see the android will 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.660
 from the potential of the southern fans 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 Thank you for having had this video was 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.560
 only a non-exhaustive comparison 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.050
 between these two android functions 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.850
 deleted feel deleted by and click 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.220
 like or to leave your opinion a 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.260
 Low comment says meet someone who 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.380
 can find this useful video does not hesitate 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.020
 in portugal only if you want to see more 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.900
 videos about technology came our 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.590
 end and stay for all the news until 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.590
 the next biennium
