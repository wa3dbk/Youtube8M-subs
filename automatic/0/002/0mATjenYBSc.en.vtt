00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.470 

we<00:00:25.800> pretty<00:00:25.980> much<00:00:26.070> agree<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.610> that<00:00:26.760> judgment

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480

of<00:00:27.539> Larimer<00:00:27.900> children<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
of Larimer children I think it's a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.630 
of Larimer children I think it's a
little<00:00:29.130> closer<00:00:29.369> than<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.810> these<00:00:31.170> last

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
little closer than that but these last

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.630 
little closer than that but these last
few<00:00:32.640> rounds<00:00:33.030> you're<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.870> important<00:00:34.640> if
