disks<00:02:52.070> sitting<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.790> here<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:55.280> will<00:02:55.520> simply

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
disks sitting on here and we will simply

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.340 
disks sitting on here and we will simply
incubate<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:57.080> right<00:02:57.590> side<00:02:57.890> up<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:59.080> this<00:03:00.080> one

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.130 
incubate this right side up and this one
here<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:02.630> will<00:03:02.810> notice<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:04.870> we<00:03:05.870> don't<00:03:05.989> have

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
here you will notice that we don't have

the organism is resistant and as we go

the organism is resistant and as we go
around<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.860> can<00:04:19.010> see<00:04:19.220> slightly<00:04:19.549> bigger<00:04:20.650> areas

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940

areas are zones of inhibitions they're

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.150 
areas are zones of inhibitions they're
called<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.660> one<00:04:29.660> would<00:04:29.840> think<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
called and one would think that the

called and one would think that the
bigger<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.700> is<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.940> better<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.310> well<00:04:34.310> not

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
bigger it is the better it is well not

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.650 
bigger it is the better it is well not
necessarily<00:04:36.280> some<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> antibiotics<00:04:38.420> are

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
necessarily some of the antibiotics are

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.730 
necessarily some of the antibiotics are
smaller<00:04:39.530> in<00:04:39.860> size<00:04:40.280> than<00:04:40.550> others<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:42.380> smaller

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
smaller in size than others the smaller

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.460 
smaller in size than others the smaller
they<00:04:42.980> are<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.420> better<00:04:44.420> they<00:04:44.570> move<00:04:44.900> out<00:04:45.050> from

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
they are the better they move out from

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.560 
they are the better they move out from
the<00:04:45.650> disk<00:04:45.950> out<00:04:46.220> through<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.640> media<00:04:46.790> or<00:04:47.210> out

the disk out through the media or out
through<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.840> agar<00:04:48.820> so<00:04:51.070> sometimes<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.280> bigger

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
through the agar so sometimes the bigger

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.980 
through the agar so sometimes the bigger
zone<00:04:53.650> doesn't<00:04:54.650> mean<00:04:55.390> that<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:56.510> works<00:04:56.750> better

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
zone doesn't mean that it works better

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.040 
zone doesn't mean that it works better
it<00:04:57.290> just<00:04:57.470> means<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.740> it's<00:04:57.950> smaller<00:04:59.050> maybe

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
it just means that it's smaller maybe

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.030 
it just means that it's smaller maybe
this<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:02.020> happens<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.110> be<00:05:03.260> a<00:05:03.440> very<00:05:03.740> big

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
this one happens to be a very big

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.180 
this one happens to be a very big
antibiotic<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.120> actually<00:05:05.300> works<00:05:05.720> better

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
antibiotic and it actually works better

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.770 
antibiotic and it actually works better
than<00:05:07.190> this<00:05:07.430> one<00:05:07.669> here<00:05:08.030> which<00:05:08.180> might<00:05:08.419> be<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> very

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
than this one here which might be a very

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.880 
than this one here which might be a very
small<00:05:09.169> antibiotic<00:05:11.230> but<00:05:12.230> in<00:05:12.530> order<00:05:12.770> to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
small antibiotic but in order to

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.710 
small antibiotic but in order to
determine<00:05:13.340> whether<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:14.000> organism<00:05:14.570> is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
determine whether the organism is

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.860 
determine whether the organism is
resistant<00:05:15.410> or<00:05:15.650> sensitive<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.510> simply

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
resistant or sensitive you just simply

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.290 
resistant or sensitive you just simply
measure<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.440> distance<00:05:18.950> from<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.970> disk

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
measure the distance from the disk

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.230 
measure the distance from the disk
across<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:22.730> clear<00:05:23.000> area<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:24.820> then<00:05:25.820> compare

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
across the clear area and then compare

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.080 
across the clear area and then compare
it<00:05:26.300> with<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.450> table<00:05:26.690> in<00:05:26.930> your<00:05:26.960> book<00:05:27.790> that<00:05:28.790> gives

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
it with a table in your book that gives

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.630 
it with a table in your book that gives
you<00:05:29.560> what<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.680> standards<00:05:31.130> are<00:05:31.280> supposed<00:05:31.520> to

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
you what the standards are supposed to

be and you can determine

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:39.269 
be and you can determine
antibiotic<00:05:36.499> sensitivity<00:05:36.650> or<00:05:37.370> resistance<00:05:38.090> to

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.279 
antibiotic sensitivity or resistance to

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.730 
antibiotic sensitivity or resistance to
various<00:05:40.279> antibiotics<00:05:41.229> same<00:05:42.229> way<00:05:42.379> they<00:05:42.529> do<00:05:42.620> it

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
various antibiotics same way they do it

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.329 
various antibiotics same way they do it
in<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.860> lab<00:05:44.349> so<00:05:45.349> you<00:05:45.379> may<00:05:45.650> not<00:05:45.800> be<00:05:45.919> doing<00:05:46.129> this

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:46.339 
in the lab so you may not be doing this

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.939 
in the lab so you may not be doing this
in<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.610> lab<00:05:46.819> but<00:05:47.559> you're<00:05:48.559> going<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.740> be<00:05:48.830> getting

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
in a lab but you're going to be getting

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.689 
in a lab but you're going to be getting
a<00:05:49.779> report<00:05:50.779> sheet<00:05:51.020> out<00:05:51.169> on<00:05:51.349> this<00:05:51.499> and<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:52.580> might

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
a report sheet out on this and it might

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.559 
a report sheet out on this and it might
be<00:05:52.819> nice<00:05:52.999> to<00:05:53.029> know<00:05:53.300> what's<00:05:54.229> going<00:05:54.469> on
