00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.670
 the temperature reduction of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.500
 fumes typical of condensation chains 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 gives rise to a considerable production of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 condensation those missing for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 a drain 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 if there is no drain in the channel or 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.619
 passes too high no problem there 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.419
 think healthy rope and plus will remember ex 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.270
 plus it is a little for condensation water 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.410
 produced by air conditioning systems 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.450
 bench condensing boiler 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
 refrigerated has a maximum flow rate of 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.649
 342 liters per hour that can 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.780
 push it 4 feet tall or 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.550
 40 mind of horizontal distance the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.199
 liquid enters directly into 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 collection tray where it comes from 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.010
 detected by a sensor that activates 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960
 immediately pump it a second 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.699
 sensor placed is higher up serves the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.859
 case of his friend's overflow 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.629
 doctor part in the three usable children 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.329
 for the alarm system and for switching off 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.579
 the san nicol plus boiler and should be placed 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.679
 near the boiler in the most position 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.089
 low must be fixed directly to the 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.550
 wall with screws and plugs 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.809
 endowment in doing so is fundamental 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.809
 check that it remains in position 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.670
 horizontal in one direction and in the other for 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 guarantee the regular operation of the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 sensors the collection tube coming 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.600
 from the boiler engages in one of the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.210
 enter the inlet diameter and 28 mm 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 using adapter the diameter can be 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 also 19 32 40 mm in this case is na 32 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.820
 mm unused revenue goes 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.829
 closed with the caps included in the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.020
 packaging evacuation of the san nicola 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.000
 spruce should be made exclusively with 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 the flexible hose supplied along six 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.369
 meters 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 the tube has engaged in the fitting of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.630
 purging, I should also close the band 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 the anti return the bleed pipe must 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.619
 follow a path as possible 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.020
 vertical then have to make a curve 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.899
 wide and enter the drain in this 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 case a dn 50 pipe in which there is 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.130
 engages using the fitting provided 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 wanting to take advantage of the report 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.030
 alarm for the Russian cordless 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.039
 a device must be set up 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.310
 acoustic signaling from the sun ecommerce 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.810
 plus and I played with three children, just in case 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 of huge accumulation of condensate 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 allow for activation of 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.220
 ringtone and at the same time 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.440
 shutdown 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.820
 boiler to complete the installation 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.560
 will move of this rose 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.140
 safety plug into the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 taken and given correct it recalls blues 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.190
 and operational
