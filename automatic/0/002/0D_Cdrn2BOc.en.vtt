lot of maps capping is pretty a

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.149 
lot of maps capping is pretty a
paramount<00:00:41.300> because<00:00:42.140> of<00:00:42.379> how<00:00:42.499> you<00:00:42.559> can<00:00:42.739> win<00:00:42.920> so

easy just by getting the cap right away
what's<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:45.229> lot<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.440> pressure<00:00:45.589> on<00:00:45.679> the<00:00:45.800> enemy

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
this would not be a good replate for

chance to win the contest the game must

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.940 
chance to win the contest the game must
have<00:01:17.180> been<00:01:17.299> played<00:01:17.539> after<00:01:17.950> April

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
have been played after April

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.620 
have been played after April
twenty-eighth<00:01:19.460> April<00:01:20.000> twenty-eighth<00:01:20.390> or

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
twenty-eighth April twenty-eighth or

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.719 
twenty-eighth April twenty-eighth or
after<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:21.979> think<00:01:22.100> that's<00:01:22.399> pretty<00:01:22.520> much<00:01:22.670> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
after so I think that's pretty much the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.830 
after so I think that's pretty much the
tail<00:01:23.030> end<00:01:23.299> of<00:01:23.979> 8.4<00:01:24.979> any<00:01:25.850> games<00:01:26.149> before<00:01:26.390> April

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
tail end of 8.4 any games before April

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.209 
tail end of 8.4 any games before April

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659

we're<00:01:56.780> going<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:56.960> talk<00:01:57.109> about<00:01:57.200> scoring<00:01:58.299> last

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
we're going to talk about scoring last

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.690 
we're going to talk about scoring last
time<00:01:59.539> it<00:01:59.689> was<00:01:59.719> based<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.140> kills<00:02:00.499> but<00:02:01.249> I<00:02:01.280> don't

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
time it was based on kills but I don't

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.830 
time it was based on kills but I don't
want<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:01.880> do<00:02:01.939> that<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.210> time<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.450> think<00:02:02.719> that's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
want to do that this time I think that's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.749 
want to do that this time I think that's
a<00:02:02.929> really<00:02:02.960> bad<00:02:03.319> way<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.560> see<00:02:03.859> who<00:02:04.310> guy<00:02:04.460> had<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
a really bad way to see who guy had the

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.410 
a really bad way to see who guy had the
best<00:02:04.969> game<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.479> wanted<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.319> use<00:02:06.530> XP<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:08.030> what

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
best game I wanted to use XP but what

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.630 
best game I wanted to use XP but what
replay<00:02:08.840> manager<00:02:09.290> does<00:02:10.040> not<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.370> a<00:02:10.400> good<00:02:10.460> job

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
replay manager does not do a good job

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.330 
replay manager does not do a good job
well<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.750> shows<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> XP<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.950> each<00:02:13.040> replay

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
well it shows you the XP of each replay

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.050 
well it shows you the XP of each replay
but

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
but

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.520 
but
it<00:02:14.209> doesn't<00:02:14.630> tell<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.989> if<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.170> person<00:02:15.500> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it doesn't tell you if the person that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.140 
it doesn't tell you if the person that
premium<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.190> not<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.760> shows<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
premium or not it just shows the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.290 
premium or not it just shows the
person's<00:02:17.690> XP<00:02:18.140> if<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.980> had<00:02:19.099> premium<00:02:19.610> your<00:02:19.970> XP

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
person's XP if you had premium your XP

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.670 
person's XP if you had premium your XP
is<00:02:20.360> gonna<00:02:20.510> be<00:02:20.569> higher<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.170> if<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.380> didn't

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
is gonna be higher and if you didn't

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.380 
is gonna be higher and if you didn't
it's<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.069> be<00:02:22.130> lower<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:23.090> doesn't

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's going to be lower so it doesn't

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.430 
it's going to be lower so it doesn't
show<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.310> with<00:02:25.310> or<00:02:25.580> without<00:02:25.790> premium<00:02:26.440> so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
show you the with or without premium so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.070 
show you the with or without premium so
that<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.709> could<00:02:27.830> kind<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.640> put<00:02:28.940> all<00:02:29.150> replays<00:02:29.870> on

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
that I could kind of put all replays on

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.470 
that I could kind of put all replays on
you<00:02:30.349> know<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.650> an<00:02:30.860> even<00:02:31.099> keel<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> can't<00:02:32.390> use

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
you know on an even keel so I can't use

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.780 
you know on an even keel so I can't use
XP<00:02:33.019> because<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.680> can't<00:02:33.890> easily<00:02:34.130> see<00:02:34.519> how<00:02:34.640> much

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.970 
XP because I can't easily see how much
XP<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.180> got<00:02:35.330> from<00:02:35.569> your<00:02:35.690> replay<00:02:35.959> what<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.709> can

XP you got from your replay what I can

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.940 
XP you got from your replay what I can
see<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.489> how<00:02:37.640> much<00:02:37.730> damage<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.269> inflicted<00:02:38.950> so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
it's going to be based on how much

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.809 
it's going to be based on how much
damage<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.560> do<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.800> most<00:02:42.950> damage<00:02:43.099> is<00:02:43.670> going

to win if there's a tie in which it

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.850 
to win if there's a tie in which it

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
would be pretty tough with damage but if

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.949

know<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> weak<00:03:36.890> points<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.370> lot<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.090> them<00:03:38.180> have

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
know the weak points a lot of them have

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.180 
know the weak points a lot of them have
to<00:03:38.510> flank<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:39.530> just<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.799> way<00:03:39.890> they<00:03:40.040> are<00:03:40.069> and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
to flank it's just the way they are and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.069 
to flank it's just the way they are and
that's<00:03:40.579> kind<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:40.880> why<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.209> think<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:41.870> game<00:03:42.019> is

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
that's kind of why I think this game is

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.170 
that's kind of why I think this game is
good<00:03:42.319> because<00:03:42.530> each<00:03:43.100> tank<00:03:43.489> type<00:03:43.700> kinda<00:03:44.000> has<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
good because each tank type kinda has a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.759 
good because each tank type kinda has a
different<00:03:44.420> play<00:03:44.540> style<00:03:44.810> if<00:03:45.049> you<00:03:45.350> use<00:03:45.440> gold

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
different play style if you use gold

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.890 
different play style if you use gold
rounds<00:03:46.190> in<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.790> medium<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.389> can<00:03:47.569> basically

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
rounds in a medium you can basically

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.599 
rounds in a medium you can basically
shoot<00:03:48.410> into<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:48.980> front<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.250> guys<00:03:49.370> like<00:03:49.549> a

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
shoot into the front of guys like a

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.879 
shoot into the front of guys like a
heavy<00:03:49.850> tank<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.470> kind<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.650> defeats

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
heavy tank and then it kind of defeats

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.129 
heavy tank and then it kind of defeats
the<00:03:51.950> whole<00:03:52.100> purpose<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:53.870> know<00:03:53.989> having

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
the whole purpose of you know having

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.780 
the whole purpose of you know having
different<00:03:54.560> tank<00:03:54.739> types<00:03:54.950> except<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
different tank types except that the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
different tank types except that the
medium<00:03:56.150> is<00:03:56.269> faster<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:57.940> no<00:03:58.940> gold<00:03:59.209> rounds<00:03:59.540> no

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
medium is faster so no gold rounds no

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.210 
medium is faster so no gold rounds no
gold<00:04:00.049> consumables<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.769> should<00:04:00.920> even<00:04:01.069> the

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
gold consumables that should even the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.370 
gold consumables that should even the
playing<00:04:01.400> field<00:04:01.489> quite<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.910> bit<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.269> know<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.200> lot

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
playing field quite a bit I know a lot

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.259 
playing field quite a bit I know a lot
of<00:04:03.410> people<00:04:03.470> don't<00:04:03.709> like<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:04.040> but<00:04:04.430> there's

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
of people don't like that but there's

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.490 
of people don't like that but there's
not<00:04:05.510> much<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:05.900> about<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.230> think<00:04:06.260> it

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
not much I can do about that I think it

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.050 
not much I can do about that I think it
makes<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:06.950> better<00:04:07.069> game<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.609> that's<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.970> way

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
makes it a better game so that's the way

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.000 
makes it a better game so that's the way
I<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.329> do<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.630> also<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.290> think<00:04:09.650> it's<00:04:09.950> more

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
I like to do it also I think it's more

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.530 
I like to do it also I think it's more
