00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 our consultant on natural farming 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.180
 Dmitry Slavgorodsky to land preparation 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
 for growing seedlings used 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.920
 treat meticulously he doesn't argue that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.840
 there are quite decent ready 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.089
 soils but to the substrate under 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
 seedlings were friable and plant roots 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.740
 got enough air needed 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020
 add to the soil baking powder and with this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.300
 the task is perfectly cope coconut 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.029
 substrate and agro perlite here such 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 sufficiently large not-expanded beads 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.349
 long stored in the soil 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 that is, they cost retain this volume 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.239
 and air easily penetrates the root 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.129
 system when adding an agrofirm then 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.059
 seedlings get air very well 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 the root if the seedlings get air then 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.289
 she root system does not rot not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.800
 there are some black problems 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.629
 leg 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.640
 know that from the volume of the soil 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.129
 baking powder should be no less 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 thirds do not forget especially if you 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.989
 love to ignite the earth in the future 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.149
 make it preparations containing 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.680
 beneficial soil microorganisms 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 Dmitry has been using the drug for many years. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 shine to soil mixture 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 turned out to be nutritious can be added to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.880
 her one more novelty granular bio 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.430
 humus the same soil can be sown but 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.770
 why is it necessary to modern soil 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 science offers a ton of options from all 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.630
 familiar peat tablets but such 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 new cylinders from extruded bio 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.180
 humus 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.610
 the plants will feel in them 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.939
 perfectly granular means 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.130
 cylinders made of vermicompost he 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.370
 pressed it needs to be soaked here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.170
 there is a special hole 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.540
 here you can pour a little bit usually 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
 land and nets till immediately seeds 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.750
 that is, the food reserves in this video geese 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.490
 enough so that the plants are here 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.040
 develop well the first time before 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.870
 further transshipment but not only 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.270
 well prepared nutritious and 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.910
 loose substrate makes the seedlings strong and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 healthy necessary ingredients for success 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.870
 light water and heat 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.970
 grow seedlings we have to 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.640
 conditions when the sun is not in the sky 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.160
 can be seen without lamps for lighting gardeners 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.290
 can not do with our flora lamps 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.600
 gardeners have long made friends with Dmitry 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.040
 reminds to buy such a lamp 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.960
 better with reflector 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.630
 otherwise a huge part of the light flux 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.380
 the flora lamp will be wasted 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.200
 inexpensive 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.630
 this is a plus there are disadvantages of this type 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.250
 over time distorted in the stream he 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 a little bit for plants becoming so 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.850
 time is not very suitable therefore these 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.290
 lamps and cost much cheaper term 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.000
 their services are much smaller but how 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.220
 pinned option scientists 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.770
 perfected our old friend 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.500
 lamp and flora and modern analogues 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.840
 shine brighter serve longer has 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.130
 built-in reflectors and even more 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.590
 I want to pay attention to plants 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.600
 most of all live diamond on ox is 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.010
 lamp which is chosen luminous flux 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.290
 so that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.170
 him repeating the solar spectrum that is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.590
 shark reflex it is sodium 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.980
 a lamp here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.390
 lighting repeats aspects repeats 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.610
 the light of the setting sun that is such 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.200
 nice yellow world and lamp diamond 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.150
 LED based 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.730
 her light may not be familiar 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.170
 to the human eye, but his plant 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.650
 will appreciate 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.459
 he has a blue red spectrum 10 in red 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.819
 LEDs are two blue LEDs they 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.470
 picked up so the blue light is responsible for 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.280
 root development red 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.290
 LEDs 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.859
 scorpion long wave responsible for 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.440
 the development of a development Osinki 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.620
 ground part of the leaves so she 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.810
 the seedlings were strong good 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.909
 budget owners will appreciate this detail 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.299
 energy led lamps consume 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.849
 few and long serve such 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.459
 and enough for many years by the way alone 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.530
 lamp that reflex that diamond can 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.720
 light up all the seedlings on the standard 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.819
 windowsill not to be unfounded 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.239
 here is the result of this seedling we 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.820
 grown in winter from absolutely 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.240
 in cloudy conditions, that is, winter is here 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.370
 not sunny and only thanks 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.160
 This is the mantra garden lamp. 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.930
 that's so short 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.820
 such thick enough stems 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.150
 the seedlings are very strong with her 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.100
 short internodes are laid 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.960
 floral flowers are laid much earlier 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.780
 kidneys, that is, it turns out that the hand 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.150
 growing plants under the lamps of factories 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.160
 flags diamond allows you to shorten the time 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.970
 growing seedlings for a half to two 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.370
 of the week 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.560
 get such seedlings in you too 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.410
 may or may not be too 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.700
 burdened with troubles come to the rescue 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.700
 modern technologies
