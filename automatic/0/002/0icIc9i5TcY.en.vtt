shoulders our arms here are not

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.700 
shoulders our arms here are not
connected<00:00:35.710> in<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:36.760> very<00:00:37.000> major<00:00:37.690> way<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.500> our

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
connected in a very major way to our

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.860 
connected in a very major way to our
body<00:00:38.950> by<00:00:39.340> anything<00:00:39.760> other<00:00:39.850> than<00:00:40.210> ligaments

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
body by anything other than ligaments

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.200 
body by anything other than ligaments
and<00:00:40.960> muscles<00:00:41.160> our<00:00:42.160> arms<00:00:42.609> are<00:00:42.730> connected

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
and muscles our arms are connected

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.299 
and muscles our arms are connected
through<00:00:43.390> our<00:00:43.690> clavicle<00:00:44.260> or<00:00:44.350> collar<00:00:44.649> bone<00:00:44.949> here

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
through our clavicle or collar bone here

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.669 
through our clavicle or collar bone here
but<00:00:45.910> as<00:00:46.149> far<00:00:46.570> as<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:46.870> bone<00:00:47.019> that<00:00:47.050> comes<00:00:47.379> around

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
but as far as the bone that comes around

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.079 
but as far as the bone that comes around
the<00:00:47.800> back<00:00:47.949> that's<00:00:48.250> just<00:00:48.429> your<00:00:48.579> shoulder<00:00:48.910> blade

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
the back that's just your shoulder blade

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.479 
the back that's just your shoulder blade
and<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:49.420> just<00:00:49.690> slides<00:00:49.989> across<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:51.250> surface

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
and that just slides across the surface

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.959 
and that just slides across the surface
of<00:00:51.730> our<00:00:52.530> ribs<00:00:53.530> in<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:53.890> back<00:00:54.190> with<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.550> muscle

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
of our ribs in the back with the muscle

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.959 
of our ribs in the back with the muscle
layer<00:00:55.120> underneath<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:56.800> bone<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
layer underneath so this bone is the

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.880 
layer underneath so this bone is the
only<00:00:58.120> bone<00:00:58.390> actually<00:00:58.899> connecting<00:00:59.440> our<00:00:59.559> arm

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
only bone actually connecting our arm

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.930 
only bone actually connecting our arm
onto<00:01:00.429> our<00:01:01.179> body<00:01:01.929> itself<00:01:02.440> onto<00:01:02.710> our<00:01:02.980> torso<00:01:03.399> so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
onto our body itself onto our torso so

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.580 
onto our body itself onto our torso so
all<00:01:04.120> of<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.360> muscles<00:01:04.570> around<00:01:04.870> our<00:01:05.199> shoulder

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
all of the muscles around our shoulder

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.590 
all of the muscles around our shoulder
have<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.010> be<00:01:06.130> strong<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.490> keep<00:01:07.120> this<00:01:07.300> joint

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
have to be strong to keep this joint

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.140 
have to be strong to keep this joint
stable<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.350> keep<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.650> safe<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:09.670> we're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
stable and to keep it safe and so we're

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.580 
stable and to keep it safe and so we're
going<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.360> be<00:01:10.420> doing<00:01:10.570> an<00:01:10.930> exercise<00:01:11.350> today

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
going to be doing an exercise today

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.620 
going to be doing an exercise today
that's<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.700> use<00:01:12.939> all<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> small

that's going to use all the small

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.749 
that's going to use all the small
muscles<00:01:14.049> in<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.320> shoulders<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.310> you're<00:01:15.640> going

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
muscles in the shoulders so you're going

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.319 
muscles in the shoulders so you're going
to<00:01:15.850> want<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.119> very<00:01:16.329> light<00:01:16.600> pair<00:01:16.899> of<00:01:16.930> weights<00:01:17.049> I

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
to want a very light pair of weights I

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.539 
to want a very light pair of weights I
have<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.659> little<00:01:20.619> set<00:01:20.829> of<00:01:20.860> three<00:01:21.159> pounders

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
have a little set of three pounders

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.880 
have a little set of three pounders
right<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.270> could<00:01:22.899> also<00:01:23.200> just<00:01:23.619> use

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
right here and you could also just use

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.530 
right here and you could also just use
soup<00:01:24.219> cans<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.790> like<00:01:24.969> if<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.270> want

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
something even lighter than that so

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.920 
something even lighter than that so
we're<00:01:27.460> going<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.640> start<00:01:27.880> out<00:01:28.090> with<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
we're going to start out with the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.020 
we're going to start out with the
weights<00:01:29.259> here<00:01:29.890> at<00:01:30.070> our<00:01:30.189> side<00:01:30.460> for<00:01:30.909> their

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
weights here at our side for their

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.630 
weights here at our side for their
elbows<00:01:31.360> at<00:01:31.509> 90<00:01:31.719> degrees<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.829> you<00:01:32.950> can<00:01:33.159> see<00:01:33.369> my

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
elbows at 90 degrees so you can see my

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.209 
elbows at 90 degrees so you can see my
position<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.210> my<00:01:34.299> elbows<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:34.869> this<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.380> my

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
position of my elbows like this and my

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.670 
position of my elbows like this and my
fists<00:01:36.850> are<00:01:37.119> up<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.630> down<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.079> my<00:01:38.200> weights<00:01:38.439> my

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
fists are up and down so my weights my

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.499 
fists are up and down so my weights my
are<00:01:38.920> pointing<00:01:39.399> up<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.789> down<00:01:39.939> perpendicular

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
are pointing up and down perpendicular

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.980 
are pointing up and down perpendicular
to<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:40.990> floor<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.490> from<00:01:42.729> here<00:01:43.000> I'm<00:01:43.719> going<00:01:43.869> to

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
to the floor so from here I'm going to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.679 
to the floor so from here I'm going to
keep<00:01:44.079> my<00:01:44.140> arms<00:01:44.590> very<00:01:44.680> still<00:01:45.250> at<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.820> elbow<00:01:46.180> but
