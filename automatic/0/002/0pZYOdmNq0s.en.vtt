00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.909 

so<00:04:34.290> now<00:04:34.410> we<00:04:34.470> have<00:04:34.710> an<00:04:34.860> OP<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:36.870> can<00:04:37.050> do<00:04:37.199> you

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
so now we have an OP and you can do you

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.740 
so now we have an OP and you can do you
can<00:04:38.070> put<00:04:38.100> basically<00:04:38.820> any<00:04:39.030> weapon<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.540> you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
can put basically any weapon that you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.670 
can put basically any weapon that you
want<00:04:40.020> there<00:04:40.310> so<00:04:41.720> that's<00:04:42.720> basically<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.350> last

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
want there so that's basically the last

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.700 
want there so that's basically the last
part<00:04:43.949> of<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.130> tutorial<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:45.389> very<00:04:45.630> short<00:04:46.020> so

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
part of the tutorial it's very short so

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.590 
part of the tutorial it's very short so
it's<00:04:47.370> because<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.639> really<00:04:47.880> isn't<00:04:48.000> much<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.479> do

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
it's because it really isn't much to do

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.110 
it's because it really isn't much to do
it<00:04:48.780> now<00:04:49.370> now<00:04:50.370> when<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.639> want<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.880> start

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
it now now when you want to start

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.460 
it now now when you want to start
mapping<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.690> got<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.900> make<00:04:52.020> sure<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.260> whole

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
mapping you got to make sure the whole

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.439 
mapping you got to make sure the whole
area<00:04:52.830> is<00:04:52.889> lit<00:04:53.160> this<00:04:53.340> area<00:04:53.729> isn't<00:04:53.820> lit<00:04:54.120> because

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
area is lit this area isn't lit because

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.570 
area is lit this area isn't lit because
I<00:04:54.630> already<00:04:54.870> showed<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.260> how<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:56.190> previous

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
I already showed you how to the previous

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.060 
I already showed you how to the previous
one<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:58.050> there<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.440> go

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
one so there you go

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.270 
one so there you go
that's<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.880> very<00:05:00.120> basic<00:05:00.300> map<00:05:00.919> just<00:05:01.919> like<00:05:02.040> the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
that's a very basic map just like the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.350 
that's a very basic map just like the
