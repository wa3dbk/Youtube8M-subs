unable to play on a real drum set for

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.540 
unable to play on a real drum set for
the<00:00:06.420> past<00:00:06.660> almost<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.830> month<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> half<00:00:08.250> I

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the past almost a month and a half I

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.740 
the past almost a month and a half I
think<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:08.940> haven't<00:00:09.240> been<00:00:09.360> able<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> play

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
think so I haven't been able to play

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.839 
think so I haven't been able to play
drums<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.230> month<00:00:10.410> or<00:00:10.530> half<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.610> think<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
drums for month or half and I think a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.249 
drums for month or half and I think a
lot<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.030> guys<00:00:12.240> struggle<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.900> same<00:00:13.049> thing

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.299 
lot of guys struggle with the same thing
I<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> lot<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.860> guys<00:00:13.980> don't<00:00:14.040> have

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
I think a lot of you guys don't have

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.039 
I think a lot of you guys don't have
access<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> drums<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> same

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
access to drums and you have the same

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.080 
access to drums and you have the same
problem<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.590> I've<00:00:17.039> been<00:00:17.310> experiencing<00:00:17.940> for

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the past month or half so I thought it

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
the past month or half so I thought it
would<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> good<00:00:20.580> idea<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.390> share<00:00:21.660> my

important for me it's usually the first

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
important for me it's usually the first
step<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> start<00:01:01.680> jamming<00:01:02.010> along<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

step when I start jamming along to
covers<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> might<00:01:03.180> record<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.600> always<00:01:04.159> just

covers that I might record I always just
like<00:01:05.309> putting<00:01:05.549> headphones<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.140> air

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
like putting headphones on and air

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.690

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
drumming along to some songs that I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.190

might<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> cover<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:09.780> makes<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
might want to cover it really makes you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.450

actual<00:01:28.710> drumsticks<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> drumming<00:01:29.939> with

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
actual drumsticks to do a drumming with

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.179 
actual drumsticks to do a drumming with
so<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.590> access<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> sticks

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so if you don't have access to sticks

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.370 
so if you don't have access to sticks
you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you can just do that but if you have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
you can just do that but if you have
access<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.680> sticks<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.189> air<00:01:35.310> drumming<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
access to sticks then air drumming is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
access to sticks then air drumming is
also<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.180> cool<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> first<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
also really cool so the first thing that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
also really cool so the first thing that
I<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.979> said<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.490> listen<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I do like I said is that I listen and I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270 
I do like I said is that I listen and I
really<00:01:39.479> try<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> keep<00:01:40.079> my<00:01:40.259> ears<00:01:40.500> sharp<00:01:41.009> even

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
really try to keep my ears sharp even

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.660 
really try to keep my ears sharp even
arm<00:01:41.640> away<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.119> drums<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:44.220> second<00:01:44.549> thing

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
arm away from the drums the second thing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.420 
arm away from the drums the second thing
I<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.630> try<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.350> rhythmic<00:01:46.829> potential

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
I do is I try to see rhythmic potential

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.179 
I do is I try to see rhythmic potential
in<00:01:47.840> everything<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.110> everything<00:01:49.860> makes<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
in everything so everything makes a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.550 
in everything so everything makes a
noise<00:01:50.369> everything<00:01:50.790> has<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> tone<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:52.290> tones

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
noise everything has a tone some tones

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
noise everything has a tone some tones
sound<00:01:52.950> good<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.399> tones<00:01:53.610> sound<00:01:53.850> bad<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
sound good some tones sound bad but I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.520 
sound good some tones sound bad but I
think<00:01:54.450> everything<00:01:54.750> makes<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> sound<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
think everything makes a sound and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.289 
think everything makes a sound and
before<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.189> could<00:01:56.310> afford<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.610> drumset<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.119> had

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
before I could afford a drumset I had

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.440 
before I could afford a drumset I had
this<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:58.320> practice<00:01:59.280> bike<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.820> pillows<00:02:00.240> on

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
this like practice bike with pillows on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.910 
this like practice bike with pillows on
it<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> had<00:02:00.930> two<00:02:01.049> drumsticks<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> made

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it and I had two drumsticks and it made

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
it and I had two drumsticks and it made
sounds<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.640> didn't<00:02:02.850> sound<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> drum<00:02:03.329> set

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
sounds that didn't sound like a drum set

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.179 
sounds that didn't sound like a drum set
at<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> was<00:02:04.110> rhythmic<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
at all but it was rhythmic and it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
at all but it was rhythmic and it
definitely<00:02:05.610> helped<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.090> lot<00:02:06.659> played<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> big

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
definitely helped a lot played a big

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
definitely helped a lot played a big
role<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> first<00:02:08.369> few<00:02:08.520> months<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> my

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
role in like the first few months of my

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.690 
role in like the first few months of my
playing<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> take<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
playing so I'm just going to take that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.630 
playing so I'm just going to take that
idea<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.180> take<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> ridiculous

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
idea and take it to ridiculous

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.059 
idea and take it to ridiculous
portions<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.650> see<00:02:15.830> I've<00:02:15.920> got

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
portions and as you can see I've got

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.920 
portions and as you can see I've got
this<00:02:16.220> drum<00:02:17.120> set<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.420> front<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.630> me<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.780> isn't

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
this drum set in front of me that isn't

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.180 
this drum set in front of me that isn't
really<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.200> drum<00:02:18.410> set<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.740> just<00:02:18.860> tons<00:02:19.040> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
really a drum set it's just tons of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.559 
really a drum set it's just tons of
things<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.580> make<00:02:19.730> different<00:02:20.060> sounds<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.510> we

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
things that make different sounds and we

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.699 
things that make different sounds and we
mock<00:02:20.750> them<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.200> I'm<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:21.350> going<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.620> have

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
mock them up and I'm just going to have

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.620 
mock them up and I'm just going to have
some<00:02:21.740> fun<00:02:22.100> but<00:02:22.819> basically<00:02:23.120> all<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.360> want<00:02:23.569> to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
some fun but basically all I want to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.510 
some fun but basically all I want to
illustrate<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.380> if<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:25.100> you're<00:02:25.400> able

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
illustrate is that if you if you're able

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.480 
illustrate is that if you if you're able
to<00:02:25.730> see<00:02:25.940> rhythmic<00:02:26.860> potential<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.069> anything

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
to see rhythmic potential in anything

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.460 
to see rhythmic potential in anything
then<00:02:29.209> you'll<00:02:29.330> be<00:02:29.450> able<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.780> produce<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.200> rhythm

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
then you'll be able to produce a rhythm

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.220 
then you'll be able to produce a rhythm
anywhere<00:02:31.310> with<00:02:31.610> anything<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.330> I'm<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.080> kind

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
anywhere with anything so I'm just kind

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
anywhere with anything so I'm just kind
of<00:02:33.320> trying<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.620> install<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> new<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:35.000> a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
of trying to install a new like just a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.250 
of trying to install a new like just a
new<00:02:35.209> perspective<00:02:35.420> maybe<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.930> think<00:02:36.020> about

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
new perspective maybe to think about

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.600 
new perspective maybe to think about
things<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.530> little<00:02:36.590> bit<00:02:36.740> differently<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.310> try

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
things a little bit differently and try

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.800 
things a little bit differently and try
to<00:02:37.670> approach<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.150> little<00:02:38.330> differently<00:02:38.630> so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
to approach them a little differently so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.940 
to approach them a little differently so
I'm<00:02:39.050> just<00:02:39.140> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.320> play<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> little<00:02:39.590> bit<00:02:39.770> and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
I'm just going to play a little bit and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:03:59.259 
I'm just going to play a little bit and
see<00:02:40.310> how<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.520> sounds<00:03:57.250> lastly<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.000> what

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
see how it sounds lastly this is what

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.970 
see how it sounds lastly this is what
probably<00:03:59.570> most<00:03:59.780> people<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.200> access<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.650> well

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
probably most people have access to well

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.470 
probably most people have access to well
not<00:04:01.100> most<00:04:01.250> people<00:04:01.579> I<00:04:01.670> think<00:04:01.730> many<00:04:02.120> people<00:04:02.299> have

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
not most people I think many people have

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.930 
not most people I think many people have
access<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.049> practice<00:04:03.680> pad<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.160> some<00:04:04.640> sticks

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
access to a practice pad and some sticks

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.330 
access to a practice pad and some sticks
and<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.720> bass<00:04:05.900> drum<00:04:05.930> practice<00:04:06.530> pad<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.950> so<00:04:07.160> the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
and a bass drum practice pad and so the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.560 
and a bass drum practice pad and so the
combination<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.880> these<00:04:08.000> things<00:04:08.269> actually

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
combination of these things actually

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.420 
combination of these things actually
give<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.260> capability<00:04:09.380> of<00:04:09.859> practicing

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
give you the capability of practicing

with<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.150> rhythmic<00:06:05.449> potential<00:06:05.870> whether<00:06:06.110> it<00:06:06.259> be

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
with a rhythmic potential whether it be

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.040 
with a rhythmic potential whether it be
your<00:06:06.680> disc<00:06:06.949> at<00:06:07.250> your<00:06:07.430> job<00:06:07.669> or<00:06:07.880> that<00:06:08.449> ridiculous

contraption<00:06:09.349> that<00:06:09.590> we<00:06:09.770> built<00:06:09.979> and<00:06:10.219> maybe

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
contraption that we built and maybe

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.689

drum practice pad putting all these

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.779 
drum practice pad putting all these
three<00:06:15.710> things<00:06:15.919> together<00:06:16.069> I<00:06:16.280> think<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.520> can<00:06:16.669> do

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
three things together I think you can do

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.490 
three things together I think you can do
a<00:06:16.819> lot<00:06:17.120> of<00:06:17.150> practicing<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:17.900> make<00:06:18.020> a<00:06:18.050> lot<00:06:18.469> of

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
a lot of practicing and make a lot of

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.830 
a lot of practicing and make a lot of
progression<00:06:18.949> move<00:06:19.849> forward<00:06:20.270> aggressively

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
progression move forward aggressively

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.439 
progression move forward aggressively
and<00:06:21.500> falsely<00:06:21.889> without<00:06:22.580> a<00:06:22.610> kit<00:06:22.849> so<00:06:23.060> you<00:06:23.300> don't

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
and falsely without a kit so you don't

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.390 
and falsely without a kit so you don't
need<00:06:23.599> a<00:06:23.630> kit<00:06:23.870> it's<00:06:24.050> not<00:06:24.169> a<00:06:24.199> deterrent<00:06:24.400> drummers

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
need a kit it's not a deterrent drummers

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.040 
need a kit it's not a deterrent drummers
usually<00:06:25.669> have<00:06:25.789> a<00:06:25.819> lot<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.060> ingenuity<00:06:26.509> so<00:06:26.900> we're

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
usually have a lot of ingenuity so we're

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.920 
usually have a lot of ingenuity so we're
able<00:06:27.199> to<00:06:27.349> do<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.830> lot<00:06:28.669> with<00:06:28.880> a<00:06:29.030> little<00:06:29.240> if<00:06:29.599> we<00:06:29.780> put

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
able to do a lot with a little if we put

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.950 
able to do a lot with a little if we put
our<00:06:30.050> minds<00:06:30.319> to<00:06:30.440> it<00:06:30.469> so<00:06:30.680> don't<00:06:30.860> be<00:06:31.330> upset<00:06:32.330> if<00:06:32.900> you

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
our minds to it so don't be upset if you

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.180 
our minds to it so don't be upset if you
don't<00:06:33.080> have<00:06:33.229> a<00:06:33.259> drum<00:06:33.469> set<00:06:33.650> you<00:06:33.830> can<00:06:33.949> still

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
don't have a drum set you can still

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.589 
don't have a drum set you can still
practice<00:06:34.400> and<00:06:34.789> be

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
practice and be

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.209 
practice and be
so<00:06:36.139> those<00:06:36.319> are<00:06:36.499> three<00:06:36.679> things<00:06:36.889> I<00:06:37.039> usually

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:38.919 
so those are three things I usually
focus<00:06:37.610> on<00:06:37.729> when<00:06:37.969> I<00:06:37.999> don't<00:06:38.330> have<00:06:38.479> access<00:06:38.749> to<00:06:38.809> a

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:38.929 
focus on when I don't have access to a

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:40.839 
focus on when I don't have access to a
