00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
details behind the new Thunderbolt 3
standard<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.100> new<00:00:17.250> standard<00:00:17.730> excitingly<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
standard the new standard excitingly is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.460 
standard the new standard excitingly is
actually<00:00:18.930> unifying<00:00:19.439> onto<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.130> USB<00:00:20.760> type-c

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
actually unifying onto the USB type-c

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.950 
actually unifying onto the USB type-c
port<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.160> new<00:00:23.369> slim<00:00:23.789> reversible<00:00:24.720> port

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
port that's the new slim reversible port

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.599 
port that's the new slim reversible port
that<00:00:25.109> everybody's<00:00:25.500> been<00:00:25.529> very<00:00:25.710> excited<00:00:26.550> about

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that everybody's been very excited about

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.810 
that everybody's been very excited about
with<00:00:26.910> USB<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:28.199> seeing<00:00:28.529> Thunderbolt<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.130> unify

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
with USB so seeing Thunderbolt now unify

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.939 
with USB so seeing Thunderbolt now unify
onto<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.269> standard<00:00:30.779> means<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.170> will<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.619> one

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
onto that standard means we will see one

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.700 
onto that standard means we will see one
single<00:00:32.369> port<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.110> needs

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
single port for all of our needs

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
single port for all of our needs
once<00:00:35.250> somebody<00:00:35.670> chooses<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.270> make<00:00:36.480> their<00:00:36.660> port

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
once somebody chooses to make their port

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930 
once somebody chooses to make their port
Thunderbolt<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:37.710> support<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.340> full

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
Thunderbolt it will support the full

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.410 
Thunderbolt it will support the full
specification<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.930> USB<00:00:40.500> 3.1<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:42.090> support

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
specification of USB 3.1 it will support

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.470 
specification of USB 3.1 it will support
DisplayPort<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.469> support<00:00:44.430> PCI<00:00:44.940> Express

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480

DisplayPort and support PCI Express
generation<00:00:46.200> 3<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.770> well<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.460> Thunderbolt<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
generation 3 as well as Thunderbolt so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
generation 3 as well as Thunderbolt so
it<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:48.750> makes<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.289> Thunderbolt<00:00:49.829> port

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it basically makes a Thunderbolt port

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.240 
it basically makes a Thunderbolt port
the<00:00:50.700> one<00:00:51.059> port<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> truly<00:00:52.230> rule<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.739> when

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the one port to truly rule them all when

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
the one port to truly rule them all when
we<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.670> real-world<00:00:54.300> usage<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
we think about real-world usage that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
we think about real-world usage that
means<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.559> 4k<00:00:55.920> monitors<00:00:56.520> could<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.850> used<00:00:57.090> at

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
means two 4k monitors could be used at

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.680 
means two 4k monitors could be used at
once

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
once

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.529 
once
it<00:00:57.930> also<00:00:58.109> means<00:00:58.469> full<00:00:58.980> 10<00:00:59.489> Gigabit<00:00:59.969> Ethernet

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it also means full 10 Gigabit Ethernet

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.200 
it also means full 10 Gigabit Ethernet
it<00:01:00.690> means<00:01:01.309> charging<00:01:02.309> over<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.670> port<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.180> well

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it means charging over this port as well

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.329 
it means charging over this port as well
up<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> hundred<00:01:04.470> watts<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.979> notebook

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
up to a hundred watts for notebook

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
up to a hundred watts for notebook
charging<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:05.939> well<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.479> 15<00:01:07.020> watts<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.530> bus

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

charging as well as 15 watts of bus
power<00:01:08.130> support<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.880> everything<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> people

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
power support so everything that people

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
power support so everything that people
want<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> USB<00:01:11.159> standard<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.790> will

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
want out of the USB standard they will

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
want out of the USB standard they will
still<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.270> able<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.720> through<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.350> new

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
still be able to get through this new

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
still be able to get through this new
updated<00:01:14.369> port<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.140> work

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
updated port and it will all just work

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
updated port and it will all just work
seamlessly<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.130> way<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.299> also

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
seamlessly that way now there will also

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.109 
seamlessly that way now there will also
be<00:01:18.750> cheaper<00:01:19.740> Thunderbolt<00:01:20.250> cables<00:01:20.700> available

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
be cheaper Thunderbolt cables available

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.609 
be cheaper Thunderbolt cables available
this<00:01:21.210> time<00:01:21.479> around<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.960> often<00:01:22.290> been<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> big

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
this time around that's often been a big

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
this time around that's often been a big
issue<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.979> Thunderbolt<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> past<00:01:23.759> but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
issue with Thunderbolt in the past but

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
issue with Thunderbolt in the past but
there<00:01:24.299> will<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.170> option<00:01:25.320> essentially<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
there will be the option essentially is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
there will be the option essentially is
a<00:01:25.979> passive<00:01:26.460> cable<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.330> basically<00:01:27.509> be

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
a passive cable which will basically be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
a passive cable which will basically be
any<00:01:28.229> USBC<00:01:29.009> cable<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.299> will<00:01:30.509> mean

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
any USBC cable but this will mean

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.910 
any USBC cable but this will mean
Thunderbolt<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.259> run<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> slightly

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
Thunderbolt will run at a slightly

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
Thunderbolt will run at a slightly
slower<00:01:32.280> speed<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.880> 20<00:01:33.329> gigabits<00:01:33.689> per<00:01:33.840> second

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
slower speed of 20 gigabits per second

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
slower speed of 20 gigabits per second
which<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.560> still<00:01:34.770> twice<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.189> fast<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.640> USB<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
which is still twice as fast as USB so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.810 
which is still twice as fast as USB so
these<00:01:37.320> kinds<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> options<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.549> make

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
these kinds of options I think will make

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
these kinds of options I think will make
this<00:01:39.360> new<00:01:39.689> Thunderbolt<00:01:40.110> work<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.950> better

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this new Thunderbolt work a lot better

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
this new Thunderbolt work a lot better
for<00:01:41.250> most<00:01:41.520> people<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.060> hopefully<00:01:42.810> we'll<00:01:42.990> see

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
for most people and hopefully we'll see

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
for most people and hopefully we'll see
wider<00:01:43.530> manufacturer<00:01:44.369> adoption<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.390> actual

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
wider manufacturer adoption into actual
