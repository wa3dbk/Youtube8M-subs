trying to get a high killstreaks and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
trying to get a high killstreaks and
then<00:00:37.980> once<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> gates<00:00:38.579> open<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.329> get<00:00:39.570> your

then once the gates open you get your
ass<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> gate<00:00:41.790> right

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
ass in the now go into the gate right

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
ass in the now go into the gate right
now<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.719> did<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.110> pre<00:00:43.320> aim<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
now just as I did and pre aim down the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.580 
now just as I did and pre aim down the
freaking<00:00:44.760> corners<00:00:45.210> why<00:00:45.809> pregame<00:00:46.350> down

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
freaking corners why pregame down

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
freaking corners why pregame down
corners<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.250> dude<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.969> spawns<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.480> very

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
corners because dude the spawns are very

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
corners because dude the spawns are very
unpredictable<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.280> spawn<00:00:50.520> behind<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
unpredictable they can spawn behind you

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
unpredictable they can spawn behind you
they<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.719> spawn<00:00:52.110> next<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.100> top<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they can spawn next to you on top of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
they can spawn next to you on top of
your<00:00:53.670> damn<00:00:53.910> head<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.960> wouldn't<00:00:55.170> even

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
your damn head and you wouldn't even

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.479 
your damn head and you wouldn't even
know<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.010> why<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.219> really

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
know it so that's why it's really

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.139 
know it so that's why it's really
important<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> pre<00:00:57.960> aim<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.980> time<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.579> now

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
important to pre aim all the time so now

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
important to pre aim all the time so now
what<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.510> doing<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.590> also

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
what I'm doing right now is I'm also

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
what I'm doing right now is I'm also
sound<00:01:02.370> boring<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.940> don't<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.559> amplify

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
sound boring if you don't use amplify

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
sound boring if you don't use amplify
you<00:01:04.619> better<00:01:05.010> start<00:01:05.280> using<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.640> because

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you better start using that because

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
you better start using that because
it'll<00:01:06.270> save<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> lot<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> deaths<00:01:07.500> because

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it'll save you a lot of deaths because

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.399 
it'll save you a lot of deaths because
uh<00:01:08.220> when<00:01:09.150> people<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> dead<00:01:09.750> silence<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.229> it's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
uh when people have dead silence on it's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.539 
uh when people have dead silence on it's
really<00:01:10.590> hard<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> predict<00:01:11.369> their<00:01:11.520> movements

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
really hard to predict their movements

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.000 
really hard to predict their movements
so<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.210> amplify<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.689> actually<00:01:13.290> does<00:01:13.590> help<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so with amplify it actually does help a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.350 
so with amplify it actually does help a
little<00:01:14.189> bit<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.640> still<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> here

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
little bit you can still kind of here

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
little bit you can still kind of here
I'm<00:01:15.450> faint<00:01:15.689> leave<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.140> there<00:01:16.290> weren't<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.680> if

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I'm faint leave it there weren't even if

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
I'm faint leave it there weren't even if
they're<00:01:17.189> wearing<00:01:17.430> dead<00:01:17.580> silence<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.290> another

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
they're wearing dead silence so another

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
they're wearing dead silence so another
thing<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> class<00:01:20.880> everyone<00:01:21.150> using<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
thing is the class everyone using is a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.590 
thing is the class everyone using is a

aggressive being passive the graph is

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.210 
aggressive being passive the graph is
aggressive<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.330> important<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.230> means<00:03:08.590> being

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.910 
use a silencer it sounds was very
important<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.750> use<00:03:58.870> dead<00:03:59.110> silence<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.680> got<00:03:59.800> to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
important to use dead silence you got to

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.920 
important to use dead silence you got to
be<00:04:00.010> stealthy<00:04:00.250> this<00:04:00.940> is<00:04:01.090> my<00:04:01.209> place<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:01.510> man

I<00:04:06.530> think<00:04:07.130> it's<00:04:07.280> really<00:04:07.460> important<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:07.940> stay

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
I think it's really important to stay

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.400
