00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
one of the most rewarding things I've

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.640 
one of the most rewarding things I've
ever<00:01:05.960> done<00:01:06.760> because<00:01:07.760> these<00:01:08.600> young<00:01:08.930> people<00:01:09.410> are

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
ever done because these young people are

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.520 
ever done because these young people are
the<00:01:10.550> mysteries<00:01:10.910> of<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.180> future<00:01:11.540> they<00:01:12.110> play<00:01:12.380> on

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the mysteries of the future they play on

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.290 
the mysteries of the future they play on
the<00:01:12.560> field<00:01:12.890> they're<00:01:13.280> with<00:01:13.520> their<00:01:13.700> parents<00:01:14.090> on

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
the field they're with their parents on

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.900 
the field they're with their parents on
the<00:01:14.390> field<00:01:14.630> they've<00:01:15.320> got<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.490> cultural

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
the field they've got the the cultural

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.130 
the field they've got the the cultural
black<00:01:17.120> background<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:17.780> they've<00:01:17.900> got<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
black background and they've got the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.560 
black background and they've got the
language<00:01:18.470> lots<00:01:18.740> on<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:20.060> there<00:01:20.390> are<00:01:20.510> a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
language lots on and so there are a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.540 
language lots on and so there are a
terrific<00:01:21.080> resource<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:21.950> we<00:01:22.100> can<00:01:22.280> use<00:01:22.310> for

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
terrific resource that we can use for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.300 
terrific resource that we can use for
the<00:01:22.820> future<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.590> it's<00:01:25.070> not<00:01:25.250> just

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the future and so it's not just

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.820 
the future and so it's not just
providing<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.390> service<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.200> missionaries

in providing education for their kids

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.219

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
but it's also a terrific way of

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:41.410 
but it's also a terrific way of
recruiting<00:01:34.070> for<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.520> future

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.300 

we<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.630> 14<00:01:43.110> different<00:01:43.229> nationalities<00:01:44.070> in

the<00:01:44.400> schools<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.540> grumper<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the schools at a grumper and this is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.350 
the schools at a grumper and this is
really<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.210> challenge<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.880> needs<00:01:51.119> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
really a challenge because the needs of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
really a challenge because the needs of
the<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.440> Dutch<00:01:52.650> are<00:01:52.830> quite<00:01:53.040> different<00:01:53.460> to

and Australians have different needs

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.980 
and Australians have different needs
again<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.820> teachers<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.690> very
