00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:09.679
 camera at htc been what we as 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.040
 ultra pixel camera describes what's in it 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.469
 behind it 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.129
 the sensors of the cameras do not teach 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.289
 got bigger 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.360
 that's 1 to 3 inches and that's it 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.070
 exactly what determines how good the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.530
 quality of the camera is just what happened 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.050
 Many people have it in incredible 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.750
 many small megapixels dismembered by 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.330
 five to eight to 13 at the same size 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.300
 sensor the sparkling back we have 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.800
 here a sensor in the usual size but 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.940
 we have deliberately renounced the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.730
 inflate megapixel 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.000
 the end gives 4 megapixel large 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.340
 Pictures from that is but the pixels are 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.980
 much bigger we have two micro ones 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.450
 big pixels so 2000 nanometers that 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.630
 If I take that in the square 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.800
 compared to a 3 10 megapixel camera 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.670
 I call that three and a half times like that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.220
 big pixel 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.430
 it absorbs much more light and before 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.440
 he hears much less noise 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.550
 because it will dismember this 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.020
 the picture is not really better 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.179
 the files get bigger and on the 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.700
 Computer looks like 3 megapixels 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:10.219
 visually we are still no 3 10 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.960
 megapixel from the user interface if i 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.759
 shoot normally like the series 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.789
 I captured a button for 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.709
 for the gravel I can shoot videos 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.359
 Can shoot during the video 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.069
 how to shoot pictures before that's like 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.630
 but had a new mode 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.909
 Introduced then I turn here once 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.310
 this is called Greek is so deep 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.279
 in life when I take prints now 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.109
 he fires pictures for three seconds 

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:34.369
 that means it's like a little video 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.159
 you can see here is running 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.459
 it is running full when I am here now 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.459
 go forth 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.850
 then I can do something mobile who still 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.590
 to adjust the right moment 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.299
 here at the mark I pressed 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.130
 he takes one second before on two 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.630
 seconds later that's when I say something 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.280
 movable as someone who enters 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 water bounces that right on the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 place where I want to go and then have 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.899
 just the picture in this one 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.090
 Magnitude 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.679
 But I can still do so very much 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.159
 Send for finishing effects 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.600
 because i could somehow get in now 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.679
 sequenz schott record of things the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.379
 go through the picture 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.330
 I have filters with which I have now 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.220
 I can alienate whole so I can 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.810
 retouch for and I say 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.920
 But I would do her recordings 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.690
 can remove object 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.130
 I have a blur very nice 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 I was ten years old for faces 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.379
 younger and have all these possibilities 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.379
 because I have so many images in reserve 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.799
 and that I always have small videos 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.010
 record, I then also in the in 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.540
 the gallery at once animated photos 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:48.760
 that's what they almost look like 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:53.109
 When Harry Potter everything moves though 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.609
 I because now he can go inside me 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.319
 from all the pictures i put on one 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.940
 day at a certain time in the place 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.500
 he shoots he does 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.139
 automatically a little video 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.310
 if i am here now i have to go at all 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.290
 The camera does not have to do anything 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.250
 say 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.810
 that cuts me to one 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.910
 interesting videos all together 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.819
 only the music and the cut 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.230
 is simply adapted to each other 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.810
 I said she is not my style 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.849
 in one of six pre-made now 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.099
 at the moment it is still colorful and happy 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.530
 Of course I can do it in such a way 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.549
 a slightly autistic French 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.220
 art guide fashion 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.290
 this is a button press and if you have the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.690
 I do not like the sequence now 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.690
 okay it creates again by newly 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:47.409
 this always fits the music 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 have worked a bit happier 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.230
 a bit like navi like instagram 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.760
 seduce directors 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.290
 I do not have to know anything, I do not have to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.879
 have a clue but the result is very 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.319
 much more interesting than if i just 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.689
 would go through my gallery 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.370
 I can then save the video 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:04.000
 and wonderful of course with facebook and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.489
 other things are good that's it 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.489
 HTC Sony camera with ultra pixel
