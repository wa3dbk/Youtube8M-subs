of any tools or molds so this is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
of any tools or molds so this is
typically<00:00:32.070> quite<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> big<00:00:32.579> constraint<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.390> the

form and you selectively apply energy to
solidify<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.930> where<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.140> want<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> be

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

formed and you do this layer by layer to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.289 
formed and you do this layer by layer to
build<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> object<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> unfortunately

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
build up the object so unfortunately

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
build up the object so unfortunately

what's<00:01:40.409> particularly<00:01:40.799> exciting<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
what's particularly exciting at the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.249 
what's particularly exciting at the
moment<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> production<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> finished

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
moment is the production of finished

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.780 
moment is the production of finished
products<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> final<00:01:44.340> product<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
products of the final product is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.319 
products of the final product is
produced<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.750> 3d<00:01:46.530> printer<00:01:46.829> technology<00:01:47.329> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
produced using 3d printer technology so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
produced using 3d printer technology so
I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.689> three<00:01:49.079> areas<00:01:49.259> where<00:01:49.770> 3d

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I think there are three areas where 3d

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.830 
I think there are three areas where 3d
printing<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.759> being<00:01:51.030> used<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.420> quite<00:01:51.659> an

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
printing is being used in quite an

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960 
printing is being used in quite an
exciting<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.710> almost<00:01:53.700> revolutionary

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
exciting way and almost revolutionary

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.690 
exciting way and almost revolutionary
and<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> field<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.100> health<00:01:56.549> care

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and that is in the field of health care

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.010 
and that is in the field of health care
where<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.110> development<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.829> low-cost

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
where we see the development of low-cost

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
where we see the development of low-cost
prosthetics<00:02:01.020> particularly<00:02:01.920> targeted<00:02:02.430> at

see the advent of lots of very exciting
applications<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:09.200> implants<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.470> for

before they actually conduct surgery but
also<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.100> actual<00:02:17.400> part<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:17.880> may<00:02:18.030> be

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
also for the actual part they may be

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.880 
also for the actual part they may be
inserting<00:02:18.990> into<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> body<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.530> replace<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.960 
smash jaw or missing cheekbone something
like<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.070> also<00:02:26.190> seeing<00:02:26.490> exciting

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
like that but we're also seeing exciting

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.450 
like that but we're also seeing exciting
things<00:02:27.180> around<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.930> possibility<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> its<00:02:29.220> use

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
things around the possibility of its use

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.310 
things around the possibility of its use
in<00:02:29.700> personalized<00:02:30.270> medicine<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> local

in personalized medicine to the local
production<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:32.960> pharmaceuticals<00:02:33.980> we<00:02:34.980> see

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
production of pharmaceuticals we see

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.560 
production of pharmaceuticals we see
another<00:02:35.250> interesting<00:02:35.760> area<00:02:36.000> around<00:02:36.240> spare

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
another interesting area around spare

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.270 
another interesting area around spare
parts<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.290> there's<00:02:37.470> much<00:02:37.620> excitement<00:02:38.040> at<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
parts so there's much excitement at the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.760 
parts so there's much excitement at the
moment<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.360> stories<00:02:39.780> around<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.590> use<00:02:40.740> of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
moment you see stories around the use of

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.890 
moment you see stories around the use of
3d<00:02:41.010> printers<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.730> space<00:02:42.030> which<00:02:42.450> sounds<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
3d printers in space which sounds like a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
3d printers in space which sounds like a
bit<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.230> gimmick<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.040> actually<00:02:44.460> has<00:02:44.820> great

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
bit of a gimmick but actually has great

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.530 
bit of a gimmick but actually has great
potential<00:02:45.390> because<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:46.080> you're<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.330> space

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
potential because if you're in the space

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.330 
potential because if you're in the space
station<00:02:48.930> or<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.170> your<00:02:49.350> mission<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.890> Mars<00:02:50.070> and

station or on your mission to Mars and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
station or on your mission to Mars and
some<00:02:50.790> small<00:02:51.180> component<00:02:51.780> breaks<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.350> is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
some small component breaks it is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.170 
some small component breaks it is
unlikely<00:02:53.010> you'll<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.370> enough<00:02:53.580> spare<00:02:53.820> parts

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
unlikely you'll have enough spare parts

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.820 
unlikely you'll have enough spare parts
for<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.480> particular<00:02:54.690> component<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.620> why<00:02:55.770> not

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
for that particular component so why not

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.730 
for that particular component so why not
produce<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.430> spare<00:02:56.640> part<00:02:56.880> where<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.510> need<00:02:57.660> it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
produce the spare part where you need it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.960 
produce the spare part where you need it
this<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.860> also<00:02:59.130> seen<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.670> world<00:02:59.850> of

there's<00:03:29.850> great<00:03:30.060> work<00:03:30.240> being<00:03:30.390> done<00:03:30.480> around<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
there's great work being done around the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.170 
there's great work being done around the
technology<00:03:31.350> side<00:03:31.560> or<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> legal<00:03:32.610> side<00:03:32.820> run

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
technology side or the legal side run

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.760 
technology side or the legal side run
the<00:03:33.270> economic<00:03:33.660> side<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.990> it<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.440> these<00:03:34.560> aren't

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
the economic side of it but these aren't

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.590 
the economic side of it but these aren't
necessarily<00:03:35.220> connected<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.270> one<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.450> the

things we're trying to do is to have a
project<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.580> brings<00:03:39.000> together<00:03:39.240> experts

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
project that brings together experts

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.140 
project that brings together experts
from<00:03:40.320> those<00:03:40.710> three<00:03:40.920> fields<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.880> help<00:03:42.030> us

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
from those three fields to help us

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.180 
from those three fields to help us
understand<00:03:42.630> what<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.410> potential<00:03:43.710> of<00:03:43.890> 3d

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
understand what the potential of 3d

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.210 
understand what the potential of 3d
printing<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.890> there<00:03:46.890> are<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> lot<00:03:47.190> of

printing really is there are a lot of

printing really is there are a lot of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
exciting things that 3d printing might

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.530 
exciting things that 3d printing might
be<00:03:49.530> able<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.800> do<00:03:49.950> but<00:03:50.580> what<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.850> need<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.150> do<00:03:51.300> is

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
be able to do but what we need to do is

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.330 
be able to do but what we need to do is
not<00:03:51.780> consider<00:03:52.110> these<00:03:52.290> as<00:03:52.350> technical<00:03:53.010> problems
