00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello, a few days ago to me 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.120
 I had to fasten on one order 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.370
 The windowsills were wooden 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.280
 and it was necessary to do so that the fasteners do not 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 was visible therefore I fastened them from below to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.230
 Slanting screw and for this I did 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.840
 such a simple fixture is a leaf 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 dvp 3 millimeter here i have 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.320
 hard bar and two wedges for which 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.579
 slithering mill means the distance between 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 these wedges are slightly larger than 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 copy sleeve 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 the chair has the ability to move done 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.600
 This is so that I can choose the groove 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 with evil 8 millimeters not in one pass 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.170
 and for several, respectively, the width 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.170
 the groove will be larger 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.100
 frezer I have makita 800 watts but with this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 I did not have a copy machine 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.969
 rings so i am homemade and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.710
 I made it with such a cut 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 it makes it possible to quickly 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 set the ring it is put under 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 I lower one screw I turn and clamp 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.400
 on top of the regular screws one movement 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.170
 ring in place means 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.030
 But in this lower guiding bar 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.810
 I have holes with exactly that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.860
 angle like the angles of lazy this hole 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:43.539
 for the screw itself i will follow it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:43.539
 and now I'm starting to mill 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.400
 just a few minute movements 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:43.030
 the work hole is ready remains only 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:50.940
 pick the appropriate and possible 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.940
 attach the screw hole here 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.140
 Here is such a simple construction on 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.250
 thanks to all of you for your attention and waiting 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.250
 you on your channel
