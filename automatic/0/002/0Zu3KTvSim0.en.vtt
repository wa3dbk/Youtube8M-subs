00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
pallets are that if you're not that

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.319 
pallets are that if you're not that
comfortable<00:01:04.570> with<00:01:04.960> doing<00:01:05.140> your<00:01:05.229> makeup<00:01:05.439> it

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
comfortable with doing your makeup it

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.610 
comfortable with doing your makeup it
provides<00:01:07.329> you<00:01:07.720> with<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.899> little<00:01:08.170> map<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
provides you with a little map in the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.980 
provides you with a little map in the
back<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:10.090> will<00:01:10.180> number<00:01:10.479> each<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.900> the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
back and it will number each of the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.719 
back and it will number each of the
shadows<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.680> it'll<00:01:11.920> tell<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:12.250> were<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.580> put

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
shadows and it'll tell you were to put

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.310 
shadows and it'll tell you were to put
each<00:01:12.940> number<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:13.990> kind<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.260> have

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
each number so you kind of have

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.530 
each number so you kind of have
something<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.890> reference<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:16.420> gives

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
something to reference to and it gives

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.750 
something to reference to and it gives
you<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.260> know<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.409> little<00:01:17.590> idea<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.640> could

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
you you know a little idea you could

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.910 
you you know a little idea you could
play<00:01:18.909> around<00:01:19.090> with<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:20.110> your<00:01:20.260> own<00:01:20.290> but

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
play around with it and do your own but

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.590 
play around with it and do your own but
you<00:01:21.400> have<00:01:21.520> something<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:21.909> goes<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.270> just<00:01:22.479> in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
you have something that goes to just in

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.960 
you have something that goes to just in
case<00:01:23.250> also<00:01:24.250> what<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.490> thought<00:01:24.640> was<00:01:24.790> pretty

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
case also what I thought was pretty

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
case also what I thought was pretty
interesting<00:01:25.390> um<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:27.400> that<00:01:27.430> I'm<00:01:28.000> used<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.450> most

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
interesting um was that I'm used to most

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.560 
interesting um was that I'm used to most
pilots<00:01:29.200> being<00:01:29.650> horizontal<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.850> by<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.510> I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
pilots being horizontal and by that I

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.700 
pilots being horizontal and by that I
mean<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:32.380> open<00:01:32.920> them<00:01:33.100> like<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:34.299> sort<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.960> but

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
mean you open them like this sort of but

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.100 
mean you open them like this sort of but
these<00:01:35.950> are<00:01:36.340> vertical<00:01:37.000> when<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:37.420> first<00:01:37.690> got<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:38.049> I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
these are vertical when I first got it I

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.140 
these are vertical when I first got it I
was<00:01:38.260> like<00:01:38.290> trying<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.710> open<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.220> let<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.060> open

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
was like trying to open it let you open

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.630 
was like trying to open it let you open
it<00:01:40.330> like<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:42.130> i<00:01:42.220> thought<00:01:42.369> was<00:01:42.490> pretty

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
it like this which i thought was pretty

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.640 
it like this which i thought was pretty
cool<00:01:42.790> um<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.340> brush<00:01:46.890> works<00:01:47.890> well<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.970> actually

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
cool um the brush works well I actually

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.859 
cool um the brush works well I actually
one<00:01:50.650> thing<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:51.010> I<00:01:51.040> do<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.939> use<00:01:51.970> this<00:01:52.600> side

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
one thing that I do is I use this side

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.649 
one thing that I do is I use this side
for<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.560> liner<00:01:53.770> also<00:01:54.340> because<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.330> found<00:01:55.510> it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
for the liner also because I found it

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.840 
for the liner also because I found it
more<00:01:55.780> useful<00:01:55.990> than<00:01:56.229> using<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:57.070> for<00:01:57.760> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
more useful than using this for the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.800 
more useful than using this for the
liner<00:01:59.250> another<00:02:00.250> cool<00:02:00.580> thing<00:02:00.640> about<00:02:01.390> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
liner another cool thing about the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.010 
liner another cool thing about the
pallets<00:02:02.200> are<00:02:02.439> that<00:02:03.100> they<00:02:03.220> have<00:02:03.400> like<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
pallets are that they have like this

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.080 
pallets are that they have like this
little<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.890> looks<00:02:06.070> like<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.220> sweater<00:02:06.700> like<00:02:06.939> a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
little it looks like a sweater like a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.020 
little it looks like a sweater like a
little<00:02:07.570> woven<00:02:07.930> texture<00:02:08.429> which<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.580> thought<00:02:09.759> was

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
little woven texture which I thought was

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.970 
little woven texture which I thought was
also<00:02:10.450> interesting

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
also interesting

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.330
