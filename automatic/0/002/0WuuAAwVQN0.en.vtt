these riders are only going to maintain
that<00:00:18.279> superlight<00:00:19.000> weight<00:00:19.029> for<00:00:19.570> just<00:00:19.960> as<00:00:20.080> Tour

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
that superlight weight for just as Tour

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.140 
that superlight weight for just as Tour
de<00:00:20.380> France<00:00:20.619> and<00:00:20.859> then<00:00:20.950> they'll<00:00:21.220> go<00:00:21.370> back<00:00:21.910> up<00:00:22.060> a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
de France and then they'll go back up a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.000 
de France and then they'll go back up a
bit<00:00:22.180> why<00:00:22.570> because<00:00:23.020> when<00:00:23.590> you<00:00:23.650> do<00:00:23.770> about

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
bit why because when you do about

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.100 
bit why because when you do about
training<00:00:24.400> and<00:00:24.850> you're<00:00:25.210> picking<00:00:25.480> up<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.930> Tour

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
training and you're picking up the Tour

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.270 
training and you're picking up the Tour
de<00:00:26.200> France<00:00:26.410> your<00:00:26.619> weights<00:00:26.770> going<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:27.070> drop

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
de France your weights going to drop

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.890 
de France your weights going to drop
down<00:00:27.460> but<00:00:27.640> it's<00:00:27.760> not<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:27.940> sustainable<00:00:28.210> weight

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
down but it's not a sustainable weight

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900 
down but it's not a sustainable weight
it's<00:00:29.170> not<00:00:29.350> a<00:00:29.380> sustainable<00:00:29.619> training<00:00:30.430> volume

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
it's not a sustainable training volume

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.290 
it's not a sustainable training volume
so<00:00:32.039> these<00:00:33.039> people<00:00:33.280> always<00:00:33.579> lightweight

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
so these people always lightweight

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.700 
so these people always lightweight
during<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.690> year<00:00:34.899> but<00:00:35.289> the<00:00:35.440> Tour<00:00:35.620> de<00:00:35.680> France

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
during the year but the Tour de France

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.650 
during the year but the Tour de France
they<00:00:36.250> drop<00:00:36.489> right<00:00:36.730> down<00:00:36.789> a<00:00:37.030> little<00:00:37.180> bit<00:00:37.329> extra

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
they drop right down a little bit extra

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.420 
they drop right down a little bit extra
it's<00:00:38.260> not<00:00:38.440> because<00:00:38.590> they're<00:00:38.739> starving<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
it's not because they're starving and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's not because they're starving and
useless<00:00:39.579> because<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.420> training<00:00:40.840> all<00:00:41.170> that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
useless because the training all that

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.979 
useless because the training all that
training<00:00:41.890> snowball<00:00:42.460> effect<00:00:42.610> builds<00:00:43.300> up<00:00:43.480> tops

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
training snowball effect builds up tops

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.660 
training snowball effect builds up tops
your<00:00:44.110> weight<00:00:44.260> down<00:00:44.470> now<00:00:45.070> after<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.460> France

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
your weight down now after the France

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.090 
your weight down now after the France
goes<00:00:46.030> back<00:00:46.239> up<00:00:46.420> another<00:00:46.660> 10-15<00:00:47.230> percent<00:00:47.350> this

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
goes back up another 10-15 percent this

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.790 
goes back up another 10-15 percent this
is<00:00:48.280> how<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.820> it's<00:00:49.809> not<00:00:50.020> I<00:00:50.050> can<00:00:50.200> say<00:00:50.410> well<00:00:50.620> it

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
is how it is it's not I can say well it

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.530 
is how it is it's not I can say well it
would<00:00:51.219> be<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.370> concern<00:00:51.790> if<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.030> person's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
would be a concern if the person's

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.870 
would be a concern if the person's
performance<00:00:52.750> was<00:00:53.440> suffering<00:00:53.980> which<00:00:54.640> one

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
performance was suffering which one

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.010 
performance was suffering which one
you're<00:00:55.000> doing<00:00:55.030> well<00:00:55.480> that's<00:00:55.780> what<00:00:55.989> people

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
you're doing well that's what people

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.200 
you're doing well that's what people
trying<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.530> power<00:00:56.829> meters<00:00:57.219> so<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.790> can<00:00:57.879> go<00:00:58.000> well

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
trying to power meters so I can go well

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.569 
trying to power meters so I can go well
but<00:00:58.660> power<00:00:58.899> is<00:00:59.110> good<00:00:59.350> my<00:00:59.860> weights<00:01:00.070> down<00:01:00.340> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
but power is good my weights down the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.970 
but power is good my weights down the
powers<00:01:00.969> up<00:01:01.149> that's<00:01:01.540> okay<00:01:01.780> if<00:01:02.649> your<00:01:02.800> weight

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
powers up that's okay if your weight

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.920 
powers up that's okay if your weight
went<00:01:03.250> down<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:03.910> couldn't<00:01:04.600> put<00:01:04.719> out<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
went down and you couldn't put out the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.029 
went down and you couldn't put out the

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
normal wattage you that you know they

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:07.560 
normal wattage you that you know they

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
so trying to the power definitely I

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.990 
so trying to the power definitely I
recommend<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:11.260> trying<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.040> move<00:01:12.159> pound<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.640> power

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
recommend I trying to move pound a power

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.460 
recommend I trying to move pound a power
tap<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.510> it's<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.690> way<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.869> go<00:01:14.110> power

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
tap and it's the way to go power

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.580 
tap and it's the way to go power
machines<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.600> power<00:01:16.600> meters<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.140> where<00:01:17.470> it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
machines and power meters is where it's

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.100 
machines and power meters is where it's
at<00:01:17.710> so<00:01:18.030> here's<00:01:19.030> some<00:01:19.210> photos<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.810> show<00:01:20.049> you

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
a time trial I like somewhat brandy

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.160 
a time trial I like somewhat brandy
Wiggins<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.420> some<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:37.750> when<00:01:37.930> they're<00:01:38.080> we

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
Wiggins and some of that when they're we

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.770 
Wiggins and some of that when they're we
could<00:01:38.350> fall<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:40.240> they're<00:01:40.420> lighter

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
could fall so because they're lighter

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.300 
could fall so because they're lighter
and<00:01:41.140> they<00:01:41.290> got<00:01:41.409> more<00:01:41.590> power

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
and they got more power

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.300 
and they got more power
what's<00:01:43.030> per<00:01:43.420> kilo<00:01:44.380> that's<00:01:44.530> all<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:44.979> matters

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
what's per kilo that's all that matters

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.980 
what's per kilo that's all that matters
that's<00:01:45.460> well<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.790> blacks<00:01:46.060> are<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:46.479> light<00:01:46.750> way

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
that's well the blacks are so light way

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's well the blacks are so light way
because<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:47.920> watts<00:01:48.220> per<00:01:48.729> kilo<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
because it's watts per kilo when the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.149 
because it's watts per kilo when the
road<00:01:49.869> goes<00:01:50.140> up<00:01:50.380> I'm<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.650> flat<00:01:50.890> that's<00:01:51.070> what

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
road goes up I'm the flat that's what

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.030 
road goes up I'm the flat that's what
matters<00:01:51.460> as<00:01:51.610> much<00:01:51.909> but<00:01:52.840> there's<00:01:53.680> two<00:01:53.829> matters

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
matters as much but there's two matters

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.160 
matters as much but there's two matters
but<00:01:54.490> when<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.820> goes<00:01:54.939> up<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.329> matters<00:01:55.600> more

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
but when it goes up it matters more

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.270 
but when it goes up it matters more
so<00:01:56.350> here's<00:01:57.280> some<00:01:57.460> pictures<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.720> riders
