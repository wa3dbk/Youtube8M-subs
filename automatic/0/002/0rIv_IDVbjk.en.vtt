00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the hey is going on I've set up my

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.640 
the hey is going on I've set up my
batter<00:00:28.080> board<00:00:28.519> I've<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.109> parallel<00:00:31.109> line<00:00:31.349> up

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
batter board I've got a parallel line up

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.450 
batter board I've got a parallel line up
here<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.700> roadway<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> know

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
here to the roadway which is you know

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
here to the roadway which is you know
that's<00:00:35.850> showing<00:00:36.270> me<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.540> slope<00:00:36.989> then<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that's showing me my slope then when I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.869 
that's showing me my slope then when I
look<00:00:38.610> down<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:40.489> particular<00:00:42.410> when<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
look down that particular when I that

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.040 
look down that particular when I that
determines<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> top<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> my<00:00:45.420> plane<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.780> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
determines the top of my plane and that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
determines the top of my plane and that
way<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.440> kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> line<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.520> what's<00:00:47.730> going

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
way I can kind of line up what's going

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.350 
way I can kind of line up what's going
on<00:00:48.559> down<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> face<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.370> wall<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.270> I'll

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
on down the face of my wall so what I'll

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.619 
on down the face of my wall so what I'll
be<00:00:51.390> doing<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.930> laying<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.550> stones<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
be doing is laying the the stones to the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.860 
be doing is laying the the stones to the
top<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.640> outermost<00:00:56.640> point<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
top to the outermost point of this this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
top to the outermost point of this this
of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.890> strings<00:00:59.629> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.660> also<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.579> my<00:01:02.579> top

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of the strings you can also see my top

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.350 
of the strings you can also see my top
of<00:01:03.210> wall<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.930> which<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.090> line

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
of wall here which is I think this line

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
of wall here which is I think this line
here<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> I'm<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.830> basically<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:11.729> about

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
here so I'm going basically from about

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
here so I'm going basically from about
eight<00:01:12.240> inches<00:01:12.630> down<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> bottom<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
eight inches down here at the bottom of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.350 
eight inches down here at the bottom of
the<00:01:14.549> hill<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.250> around<00:01:17.250> three<00:01:17.549> feet<00:01:17.580> off<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the hill up to around three feet off the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
the hill up to around three feet off the
tar<00:01:18.750> over<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> top<00:01:20.150> it's<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> steep

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
tar over at the top it's kind of a steep

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.160 
tar over at the top it's kind of a steep
slope<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.780> apply<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
slope but you know you just apply the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
slope but you know you just apply the
standards<00:01:25.830> everything's<00:01:26.310> laid<00:01:26.580> level

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
standards everything's laid level

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.190 
standards everything's laid level
tilting<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.200> every

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
tilting back in a little bit and every

cap stones is I'll be sending you know
I'll<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:41.030> essentially<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> spring<00:01:42.540> stone

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
I'll have a essentially a spring stone

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.350 
I'll have a essentially a spring stone
that's<00:01:43.189> tied<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> body<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> wall

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
that's tied into the body of the wall

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.310 
that's tied into the body of the wall
and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.610> stones<00:01:48.180> above<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> can

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and then the the stones above it can

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
to show you how the batter lines are set

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.300 
to show you how the batter lines are set
up<00:01:59.780> that<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.380> I've<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.740> some<00:02:01.799> stones

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
up that you can see I've got some stones

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.389 
up that you can see I've got some stones
up<00:02:02.579> there<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.030> holding<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.420> line<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
up there that are holding my line up and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.369 
up there that are holding my line up and
so<00:02:05.399> I've<00:02:05.549> looked<00:02:05.880> raised<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.320> lower<00:02:07.710> line<00:02:09.379> up

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
so I've looked raised this lower line up

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.280 
so I've looked raised this lower line up
into<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> air<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:12.450> excavator<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.050> coming

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
into the air the excavator is coming

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.760
