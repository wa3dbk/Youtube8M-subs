00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.629
 we are bulciago 182 retractable landing gear 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.430
 we'll see 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.430
 what I am the slip is the drift 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.469
 now it will make a turn we pay a lot of attention to the family 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.469
 telos badoo metro 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.029
 when it is aimed we lean too much 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.419
 laterally flat with respect to the skin 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.749
 the plane slipped 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.120
 as well as forward it also moves to the perfect side 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
 of the horizontal component of lift 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 if it is not sufficiently opposed by force 5 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 the pale as we have seen moves 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 towards the past wing 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 let's see what happens now 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 I love you too much during the turn 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 airplane veers 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 vlc tango 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.020
 in excess of the wing inclination 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 because the centrifugal force 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.910
 becomes greater than the horizontal component 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.710
 lift by moving the aircraft sideways outwards for virality 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.380
 the same happens when I love you yep yep without simultaneously 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.910
 pinarella nadal 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 on the same side 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
 we are therefore in a mad race which is the opposite of slips 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 the ball moves towards the tin 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.530
 I emphasize that the real area slipped 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.880
 in drift 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.770
 with reduced performance 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.250
 perfect relative wind time that plows alongside plague 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.279
 generating an increase in resistance due 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.699
 greater 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:15.609
 alice moves
