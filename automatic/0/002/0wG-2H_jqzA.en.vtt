hey everyone this beam attack is back
with<00:00:05.160> another<00:00:05.279> starcraft<00:00:06.029> 2<00:00:06.180> video<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:07.170> time

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
with another starcraft 2 video this time

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.169 
with another starcraft 2 video this time
that's<00:00:07.680> be<00:00:07.859> played<00:00:08.099> right<00:00:08.280> over<00:00:08.490> there<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
that's be played right over there and

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.209 
that's be played right over there and
this<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.110> i<00:00:10.139> like<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.469> call<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.710> little<00:00:11.099> bit

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this is what i like to call a little bit

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.759 
this is what i like to call a little bit
of<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.580> hundred<00:00:12.179> percent<00:00:12.330> all<00:00:12.750> natural<00:00:13.349> cheese

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
of a hundred percent all natural cheese

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.269 
of a hundred percent all natural cheese
just<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.849> little<00:00:15.059> strategy<00:00:15.389> i<00:00:15.690> thought<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.279> you

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
just a little strategy i thought of you

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.250 
just a little strategy i thought of you
can<00:00:17.400> probably<00:00:17.580> tell<00:00:17.840> because<00:00:18.840> i'm<00:00:19.140> not

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
can probably tell because i'm not

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.720 
can probably tell because i'm not
building<00:00:19.590> anything<00:00:19.830> by<00:00:20.100> larvae<00:00:20.400> right<00:00:20.550> now

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
building anything by larvae right now

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.540 
building anything by larvae right now
now<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.080> modified<00:00:22.830> version<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.400> these

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
now this is a modified version of these

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.400 
now this is a modified version of these
certainly<00:00:24.029> brush<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.510> called<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> six<00:00:25.140> pool

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
certainly brush I called the six pool

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
certainly brush I called the six pool
delay<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.580> we're<00:00:26.699> obviously<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> start

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
delay so we're obviously going to start

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.040 
delay so we're obviously going to start
with<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> spawning<00:00:28.320> pool<00:00:28.849> see<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
with the spawning pool see I'm so

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
with the spawning pool see I'm so
awesome<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.439> goes<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.279> when<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
awesome it goes down right when the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.729 
awesome it goes down right when the
federal<00:00:32.880> cat<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> about<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> reach<00:00:33.630> 200<00:00:34.110> now<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
federal cat is about to reach 200 now I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560 
federal cat is about to reach 200 now I
don't<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.130> suggest<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.390> any

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
don't really suggest you do this to any

don't really suggest you do this to any
platinum<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.620> diamond<00:00:37.800> level<00:00:38.160> players<00:00:38.550> it's

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
platinum or diamond level players it's

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.170 
platinum or diamond level players it's
only<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:39.960> strategy<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:41.000> if<00:00:42.000> you're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
only a good strategy with if you're

or<00:00:46.020> whatever<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
or whatever it is so what we're going to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
or whatever it is so what we're going to
do<00:00:47.969> after<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.809> thought<00:00:48.989> our<00:00:49.110> dis<00:00:49.260> fighting

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
do after we thought our dis fighting

do after we thought our dis fighting
bulls<00:00:49.860> only<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:51.270> drones<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:52.260> some

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
bulls only make two drones now some

there you you're going to want to wait a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
there you you're going to want to wait a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
create the first overlord but remember

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
create the first overlord but remember
once<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.880> there's<00:01:33.390> no<00:01:33.540> turning<00:01:33.810> back

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
once you do this there's no turning back

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.940 
once you do this there's no turning back
now<00:01:36.170> we're<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> put<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> rally

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
now we're only going to put the rally

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.420 
now we're only going to put the rally
point<00:01:38.210> at<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.630> ramp<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> base<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
point at the ramp of the base this is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
point at the ramp of the base this is
this<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.909> why<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.210> called<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> six<00:01:42.810> pool

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this is why it's called the six pool

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
this is why it's called the six pool
delayed<00:01:43.770> since<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:44.579> delaying<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.210> rush

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
delayed since we're delaying the rush

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.410 
delayed since we're delaying the rush
until<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.920> good<00:01:47.460> amount<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.790> forces<00:01:48.240> out

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
until we get a good amount of forces out

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.289 
until we get a good amount of forces out
so<00:01:49.200> after<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.340> Overlord<00:01:50.729> comes<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.149> what

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so after the Overlord comes out what

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
so after the Overlord comes out what
we're<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.990> create<00:01:52.399> two<00:01:53.399> sets<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
we're going to do is create two sets of

preservatives you build get right into

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.340 
preservatives you build get right into
the<00:02:11.580> action

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the action

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.260 
the action
now<00:02:12.740> that's<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> back<00:02:13.460> rub<00:02:13.490> however
