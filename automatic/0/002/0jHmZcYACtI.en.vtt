thing on your car it's tires after all

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.200 
thing on your car it's tires after all
they're<00:00:12.300> what<00:00:12.480> connect<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> car<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> road

what if the amount of tread they're

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.769 
what if the amount of tread they're
required<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:17.190> actually<00:00:17.789> much<00:00:18.150> higher<00:00:18.390> than

we're<00:00:18.990> being<00:00:19.230> led<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> believe<00:00:20.270> it<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.480> some

we're being led to believe it was some
years<00:00:21.990> ago<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.949> tests<00:00:23.820> were<00:00:24.000> done<00:00:24.210> to

explain to us the format of what you're

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.830 
explain to us the format of what you're
doing<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.640> today<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.329> we're<00:00:48.510> doing<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
doing here today all we're doing is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080 
doing here today all we're doing is
taking<00:00:48.960> four<00:00:49.379> popular<00:00:49.980> cars<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:50.910> brake

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
taking four popular cars and we're brake

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
taking four popular cars and we're brake
testing<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> West<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.559> three

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
testing them in the West with three

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.889 
testing them in the West with three
millimeters<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> tread<00:00:53.699> depth<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.690> when<00:00:54.809> we're

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
millimeters a tread depth and when we're

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.180 
millimeters a tread depth and when we're
doing<00:00:55.020> five<00:00:55.260> runs<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> try<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.100> an

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
doing five runs I need to try to get an

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
doing five runs I need to try to get an
average<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.730> how<00:00:56.940> far<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.539> takes<00:00:57.750> them<00:00:57.840> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
average see how far it takes them to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.270 
average see how far it takes them to
stop<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.500> they've<00:00:58.590> got<00:00:58.680> three<00:00:58.829> millimeters

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
stop when they've got three millimeters

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
stop when they've got three millimeters
of<00:00:59.399> tread<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.210> we're<00:01:00.570> getting<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:01.230> with

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
of tread then we're getting them with

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.170 
of tread then we're getting them with
one<00:01:01.859> point<00:01:02.070> six<00:01:02.280> millimeters<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.910> red<00:01:03.090> which

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
one point six millimeters at red which

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
one point six millimeters at red which
is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> legal<00:01:03.600> limit<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.769> same<00:01:05.010> test

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
is the legal limit and in the same test

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
is the legal limit and in the same test
again<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.479> idea<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
again and the idea is that a lot of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.450 
again and the idea is that a lot of
manufacturers<00:01:07.860> recommend<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> should

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
manufacturers recommend you should

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
manufacturers recommend you should
change<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.880> car<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> three<00:01:09.540> millimeters

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
change your car to three millimeters

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960 
change your car to three millimeters
rather<00:01:10.710> than<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> extra<00:01:11.250> legal<00:01:11.610> limit

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
rather than the extra legal limit

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.179 
rather than the extra legal limit
because<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> actual<00:01:13.229> performance<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
because the actual performance of the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
because the actual performance of the
time<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:15.060> tells<00:01:15.299> off<00:01:15.570> after<00:01:16.380> three

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
time really tells off after three

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
time really tells off after three
millimeters<00:01:17.100> tread<00:01:17.340> depth<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> first

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
millimeters tread depth so the first

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.749 
millimeters tread depth so the first
step<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> process<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> send<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.490> four

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
step of the process was to send all four

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.520 
step of the process was to send all four
vehicles<00:01:21.000> onto<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> wet<00:01:21.750> strip<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.259> tread
