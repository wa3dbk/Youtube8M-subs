key differences now on the old come fix

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.580 
key differences now on the old come fix
you<00:00:31.380> easily<00:00:31.710> tell<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.099> logo<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:33.590> these

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you easily tell by the logo here these

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080 
you easily tell by the logo here these
logos<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:35.130> saying<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.579> talking<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
logos are saying I'm talking about the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.049 
logos are saying I'm talking about the
otter<00:00:36.270> design<00:00:36.719> itself<00:00:37.430> fake<00:00:38.430> ones<00:00:38.670> used<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> be

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
otter design itself fake ones used to be

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.369 
otter design itself fake ones used to be
a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.329> blacker<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:41.010> example<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:42.960> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
a lot blacker for example this one so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
a lot blacker for example this one so
that's<00:00:43.500> how<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> fake<00:00:44.160> logos<00:00:44.520> used<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.879> but

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that's how the fake logos used to be but

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.700 
that's how the fake logos used to be but
now<00:00:45.090> they're<00:00:45.539> they're<00:00:46.020> pretty<00:00:46.260> much<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.559> same

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
now they're they're pretty much the same

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
now they're they're pretty much the same
as<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.399> count<00:00:47.610> those<00:00:47.789> anymore<00:00:48.030> but

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
as actually can count those anymore but

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
as actually can count those anymore but
in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> event<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.230> should<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> black<00:00:49.739> one

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
in the event you should get a black one

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.610 
in the event you should get a black one
you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.399> fake<00:00:51.410> another<00:00:52.410> key

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you know it's fake another key

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
you know it's fake another key
difference<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.489> color<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.590> I'm

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
difference is this color right here I'm

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
difference is this color right here I'm
not<00:00:55.800> sure<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.340> telling<00:00:56.760> camera

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
not sure if you a little telling camera

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.049 
not sure if you a little telling camera
I<00:00:57.180> mean<00:00:57.420> even<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.750> person<00:00:57.930> you'll<00:00:58.289> color<00:00:58.559> blind

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
I mean even a person you'll color blind

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
I mean even a person you'll color blind
so<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> difference<00:01:01.020> they're<00:01:01.489> trying

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so that's the difference they're trying

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.560 
so that's the difference they're trying
to<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.640> some<00:01:02.789> lighting<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.480> it's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to get some lighting on there but it's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.590 
to get some lighting on there but it's
kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> hard<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.170> even<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> person<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
kind of hard to see even in person and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
kind of hard to see even in person and
the<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.630> difference<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.350> front<00:01:07.619> check

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the other difference on the front check

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330 
the other difference on the front check
out<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:09.860> like<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> said<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
out these two like I said this is the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.620 
out these two like I said this is the
fake<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.150> they're<00:01:12.299> all<00:01:12.330> right

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
fake one right here they're all right

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.370 
fake one right here they're all right
side<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.710> font<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> Moto<00:01:14.640> X<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.330> i<00:01:16.200> would

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
side the font for the Moto X is i would

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.179 
side the font for the Moto X is i would
say<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:17.270> 75%<00:01:18.270> bigger<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
say about 75% bigger look at that so

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.310 
say about 75% bigger look at that so
maybe<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.330> packaging<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
maybe put your packaging up you here and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.820 
maybe put your packaging up you here and
now<00:01:22.710> you'll<00:01:22.890> compare<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.710> even<00:01:25.710> this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
now you'll compare that so even this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.670 
now you'll compare that so even this
made<00:01:26.130> sign<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.759> here<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.290> sweetie

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
made sign right here so it's a sweetie

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.819 
made sign right here so it's a sweetie
smaller<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> fake<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> go

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
smaller on the fake one so there we go

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.010 
smaller on the fake one so there we go
so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:34.979> look<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:35.939> another<00:01:36.930> way

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
so you can look at there now another way

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.069 
so you can look at there now another way
to<00:01:37.140> tell<00:01:37.380> us<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> bottom<00:01:38.540> now<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
to tell us at the bottom now see this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
to tell us at the bottom now see this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
 ignore the right the left side

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.539 
 ignore the right the left side

looking<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.709> much<00:02:55.860> realistic<00:02:56.340> these<00:02:56.459> days

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
looking so much realistic these days

looking so much realistic these days
it's<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.200> very<00:02:58.200> hard<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.470> tell<00:02:58.650> compared<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.100> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
it's a very hard to tell compared to a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.880 
it's a very hard to tell compared to a
couple<00:02:59.370> years<00:02:59.550> ago<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.900> he's<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.410> packages

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
couple years ago so he's on packages

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:14.210 
couple years ago so he's on packages
real<00:03:05.100> quick<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:11.550> one<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.940> them<00:03:13.010> alright<00:03:14.010> so

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
real quick that one of them alright so

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.820 
real quick that one of them alright so
here's<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.670> case<00:03:14.880> doesn't<00:03:15.239> tell<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.620> back

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
here's the case doesn't tell on the back

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.460 
here's the case doesn't tell on the back
it<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.220> exactly<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.120> same<00:03:18.390> same<00:03:19.110> thing<00:03:19.320> with

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
it is exactly the same same thing with

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.710 
it is exactly the same same thing with
the<00:03:19.500> sides<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.430> everything<00:03:20.850> else<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.540> only

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the sides and everything else the only

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.270 
the sides and everything else the only
difference<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:23.370> front<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.950> that's<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
difference is the front so that's the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.830 
difference is the front so that's the
major<00:03:26.430> difference<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.180> front<00:03:27.420> as<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.780> can

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
major difference it's a front as you can

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.590 
major difference it's a front as you can
tell<00:03:28.070> this<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> real<00:03:29.580> one<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.239> fake<00:03:30.420> one

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
tell this is the real one is to fake one

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.900 
tell this is the real one is to fake one
to<00:03:30.720> look<00:03:30.930> at<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.950> that's<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.250> auto<00:03:32.400> logos<00:03:32.790> up

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
to look at so that's the auto logos up

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.210 
to look at so that's the auto logos up
here<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.570> real<00:03:33.720> one<00:03:33.870> fake<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:34.680> above

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
here on the real one fake one it's above

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.440 
here on the real one fake one it's above
it<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.950> that's<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.190> difference<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.880> where<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
it so that's the difference is where the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.740 
it so that's the difference is where the
logo<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:40.850> other<00:03:41.850> than<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.420> would<00:03:42.510> be<00:03:42.600> very

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
logo is other than that it would be very

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.100 
logo is other than that it would be very
very<00:03:42.930> hard<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.290> tell<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.329> event<00:03:45.420> is

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
very hard to tell so in the event is

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.900 
very hard to tell so in the event is
counter<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.680> i<00:03:46.709> want<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.890> start<00:03:47.070> doing<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
counter if i want to start doing that to

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.060 
counter if i want to start doing that to
make<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> new<00:03:48.209> post<00:03:48.420> but<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> moment<00:03:49.070> they
