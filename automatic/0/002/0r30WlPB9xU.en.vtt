of follow up and cover that topic a
little<00:00:08.429> bit<00:00:08.670> more<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:10.110> know<00:00:10.200> an<00:00:10.290> example

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
little bit more so you know an example

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.900 
little bit more so you know an example
of<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.889> these<00:00:11.010> strings<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.730> do

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
of one of these strings that you can do

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.749 
of one of these strings that you can do
is<00:00:12.179> cassie's<00:00:12.719> back<00:00:13.130> 124<00:00:14.130> looks<00:00:14.460> like<00:00:14.580> that

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
is cassie's back 124 looks like that

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.039 
is cassie's back 124 looks like that
right<00:00:14.940> I'll<00:00:15.120> have<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.269> block<00:00:15.570> just<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.960> can

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
right I'll have a block just so you can

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.689 
right I'll have a block just so you can
see<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.710> there<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.340> gap<00:00:17.550> between

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
see so there is actually a gap between

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.400 
see so there is actually a gap between
that<00:00:18.060> second<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.510> third<00:00:18.660> hit<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.170> there's<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that second and third hit so there's a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.570 
that second and third hit so there's a
couple<00:00:19.529> things<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> showed<00:00:20.460> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the answer is yeah you have a couple of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.350 
the answer is yeah you have a couple of
options<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.699> use<00:00:53.789> x-ray<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
options you know you can use x-ray to go

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.639 
options you know you can use x-ray to go
through<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> thing

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
through it that's the same kind of thing

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.720 
through it that's the same kind of thing
right<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.129> using<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> armor<00:00:56.640> from

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
right you're just using the armor from

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
right you're just using the armor from
your<00:00:56.910> x-ray<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.170> through<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> same<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
your x-ray to go through it same kind of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
your x-ray to go through it same kind of
idea<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.000> other<00:01:00.090> thing<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.809> back

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
idea the other thing is you can back

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.689 
idea the other thing is you can back
dash<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.649> back<00:01:01.890> dashes<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.520> game

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
dash because back dashes in this game

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.939 
dash because back dashes in this game
have<00:01:02.940> invincibility<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:04.199> means<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.860> know

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
have invincibility which means you know

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.170 
have invincibility which means you know
you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.460> through<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.640> gap<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you can go right through that gap in the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.820 
you can go right through that gap in the
string<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> lot<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> times<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> can

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
string and then a lot of times you can

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.500 
string and then a lot of times you can
contest<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.580> depending<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
contest what they do depending on the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.120 
contest what they do depending on the
situation<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.380> works<00:01:10.619> no<00:01:10.799> matter<00:01:10.830> where

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
situation and this works no matter where

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
situation and this works no matter where
you<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.610> even<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.540> you're<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you are right even if you're in the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.179 
you are right even if you're in the
corner<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.560> back<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.770> shit

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
corner you can still back that shit

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.460 
corner you can still back that shit
because<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> invincibility<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
because the invincibility on it so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.800 
because the invincibility on it so
that's<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.100> keep<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.280> mind

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
that's just something to keep in mind

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.420 
that's just something to keep in mind
another<00:01:18.810> thing<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:20.130> another

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
another thing you can do or another

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
another thing you can do or another
question<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.450> happens<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:22.020> your

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
question I got was what happens if your

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
question I got was what happens if your
opponent<00:01:22.409> knows<00:01:23.100> you're<00:01:23.580> gonna<00:01:23.670> try<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> armor

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
opponent knows you're gonna try to armor

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
opponent knows you're gonna try to armor
so<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.470> good<00:01:25.590> question<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.490> my

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so that's a good question so if my

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.249 
so that's a good question so if my
opponent<00:01:27.000> thinks<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.570> gonna<00:01:27.659> try<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> armor

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
opponent thinks I'm gonna try to armor

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.679 
opponent thinks I'm gonna try to armor
they<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.890> bait<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.479> my

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
they can bait it out and then now my

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
they can bait it out and then now my
meter<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.079> wasted<00:01:32.210> right<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
meter is wasted right so now that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080 
meter is wasted right so now that
they're<00:01:34.020> safe<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.220> I'll<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.729> poke<00:01:35.880> out

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
they're safe but then I'll just poke out

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
they're safe but then I'll just poke out
right<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.560> turns<00:01:37.799> into<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> weird<00:01:38.400> little

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right so it turns into this weird little

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
right so it turns into this weird little
guessing<00:01:38.820> game<00:01:39.000> where<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> guess

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
guessing game where you have to guess

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
guessing game where you have to guess
you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.770> he<00:01:40.950> armor<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> string

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you know will he armor the string

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
you know will he armor the string
willing<00:01:41.939> armor<00:01:42.390> through<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> string<00:01:42.780> what's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
willing armor through the string what's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.389 
willing armor through the string what's
the<00:01:43.079> detail<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.590> what's<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> situation<00:01:44.130> going

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the detail or what's the situation going

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.399 
the detail or what's the situation going
to<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.420> something<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:45.960> if

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
to be right so there's something also if

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.569 
to be right so there's something also if
your<00:01:46.530> opponent<00:01:46.710> knows<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> back

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
your opponent knows you're going to back

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.420 
your opponent knows you're going to back
dash<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.130> answer

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
dash then this is a pretty good answer

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.910 
dash then this is a pretty good answer
to<00:01:50.670> deal<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.180> patch<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.829> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to deal with the back patch right so you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.760 
to deal with the back patch right so you
have<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.189> about<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.670> well<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
have to think about that as well so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.899 
have to think about that as well so
there<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> foolproof

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
there you know this is not a foolproof

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
there you know this is not a foolproof
solution<00:01:57.360> right<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.710> something

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
solution right this is just something

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.700 
solution right this is just something
that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.090> deal<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:00.930> some<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that you can do to deal with some of the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
that you can do to deal with some of the
situation's<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.579> put<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.329> happen<00:02:03.570> all

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
situation's you get put in to happen all

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.090 
situation's you get put in to happen all
the<00:02:03.689> time<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:04.170> these<00:02:04.290> these<00:02:04.649> strings<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the time with these these strings that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.289 
the time with these these strings that
have<00:02:05.219> gaps<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> things

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
have gaps in them and a lot of things

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.029 
have gaps in them and a lot of things
are<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.740> opponent's

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
are like this right if your opponent's

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.619 
are like this right if your opponent's
ever<00:02:08.190> doing<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> cancel<00:02:08.849> from<00:02:09.000> down<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.420> or

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
ever doing a cancel from down one or

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.119 
ever doing a cancel from down one or
down<00:02:09.780> three<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.140> down<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.619> anything<00:02:10.920> like

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
down three or down for anything like

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.500 
down three or down for anything like
that<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.520> there's<00:02:11.670> always<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.940> gap<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that then there's always a gap that you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.309 
that then there's always a gap that you
can<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.080> know

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
can you know

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.809 
can you know
interruptible<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:14.640> think<00:02:14.730> about

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
interruptible so you can think about

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.119 
interruptible so you can think about
that<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.209> well<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.560> lot<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.590> characters<00:02:16.950> have

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
that as well a lot of characters have

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.649 
that as well a lot of characters have
strings<00:02:17.459> or<00:02:17.639> gaps<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:17.939> use<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.299> there<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
strings or gaps they use on there and

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.349 
strings or gaps they use on there and
yeah<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.099> not<00:02:20.249> a<00:02:20.280> foolproof<00:02:20.639> option

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
yeah this is not a foolproof option

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.699 
yeah this is not a foolproof option
right<00:02:21.480> there<00:02:21.719> are<00:02:21.900> ways<00:02:22.139> that<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.530> opponent

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
right there are ways that your opponent

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.559 
right there are ways that your opponent
can<00:02:22.980> adjust<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.579> when<00:02:23.849> your<00:02:23.969> opponent<00:02:24.299> adjust

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
can adjust and when your opponent adjust

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.940 
can adjust and when your opponent adjust
then<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.959> adjust<00:02:25.079> you<00:02:25.409> know<00:02:25.469> I<00:02:25.560> mean<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.859> one

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
then you adjust you know I mean it's one

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.349 
then you adjust you know I mean it's one
of<00:02:26.040> those<00:02:26.099> back<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.489> forth<00:02:26.639> things<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.329> I

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
of those back and forth things but I

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.369 
of those back and forth things but I
just<00:02:27.480> want<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.689> cover<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.989> topic<00:02:28.139> a<00:02:28.349> little
