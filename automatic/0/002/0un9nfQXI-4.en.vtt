that<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.860> game<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.099> definitely<00:01:20.399> be

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
that and the game will definitely be

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:21.800 
that and the game will definitely be
improved<00:01:20.789> when<00:01:20.910> some<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.240> people<00:01:21.390> actually

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
improved when some more people actually

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.419 
improved when some more people actually
get<00:01:21.899> into<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> lobbies<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.950> overall<00:01:23.190> guys

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
get into the lobbies but overall guys

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:24.830

I'm<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.670> enjoying<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> beta<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.599> far

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm really enjoying the beta so far

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
I'm really enjoying the beta so far
black<00:01:25.289> ops<00:01:25.440> 3<00:01:25.709> feels<00:01:26.069> really<00:01:26.429> new<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
black ops 3 feels really new to me it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.279 
black ops 3 feels really new to me it
doesn't<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.270> feel<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.569> any<00:01:27.899> other<00:01:28.080> call

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
doesn't really feel like any other call

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.139 
doesn't really feel like any other call
of<00:01:28.410> duty<00:01:28.679> it<00:01:28.830> has<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.640> slight<00:01:29.940> feeling

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
of duty it has a really slight feeling

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.150 
of duty it has a really slight feeling
of<00:01:30.300> black<00:01:30.479> ops<00:01:30.690> 2<00:01:30.959> which<00:01:31.649> makes<00:01:31.890> sense<00:01:32.009> because

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
of black ops 2 which makes sense because

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.219 
of black ops 2 which makes sense because
it<00:01:32.459> says<00:01:32.580> black<00:01:32.789> ops<00:01:33.000> 3<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.690> other<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.170> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it says black ops 3 but other than that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.779 
it says black ops 3 but other than that
it<00:01:34.470> doesn't<00:01:34.679> really<00:01:34.800> have<00:01:34.920> any<00:01:35.039> similarities

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
it doesn't really have any similarities

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.639 
it doesn't really have any similarities
to<00:01:35.940> any<00:01:36.090> other<00:01:36.239> call<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.599> duty's<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.470> one

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
to any other call of duty's now one

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.990 
to any other call of duty's now one
thing<00:01:37.679> that<00:01:37.860> gets<00:01:38.099> really<00:01:38.399> irritating<00:01:38.940> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
thing that gets really irritating and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.249 
thing that gets really irritating and
that<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.149> hope<00:01:39.209> they<00:01:39.539> add<00:01:39.660> to<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> game<00:01:40.080> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that i hope they add to the game and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.690 
that i hope they add to the game and
maybe<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.250> game<00:01:41.369> i<00:01:41.399> don't<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.670> i

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
maybe it's in the game i don't know i

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.100 
maybe it's in the game i don't know i
tried<00:01:41.819> looking<00:01:42.209> for<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> i<00:01:42.539> couldn't<00:01:42.810> find<00:01:42.899> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
tried looking for it i couldn't find it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
tried looking for it i couldn't find it
and<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.709> toughness<00:01:44.099> your<00:01:44.759> guy<00:01:44.940> punches

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and that is toughness your guy punches

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.180 
and that is toughness your guy punches
like<00:01:45.569> crazy<00:01:45.929> when<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.289> shot<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.800> always

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
like crazy when you get shot I always

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.650 
like crazy when you get shot I always
die<00:01:47.459> because<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:47.910> especially<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.539> use

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
die because of it especially when use

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.059 
die because of it especially when use
the<00:01:48.780> sorrowful<00:01:49.080> it's<00:01:49.679> not<00:01:49.830> really<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
the sorrowful it's not really that

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.499 
the sorrowful it's not really that
prominent<00:01:50.489> when<00:01:50.580> you're<00:01:50.670> using<00:01:50.789> an<00:01:50.970> SMG<00:01:51.239> or<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
prominent when you're using an SMG or a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.880 
prominent when you're using an SMG or a
shotgun<00:01:51.929> but<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.470> guys<00:01:52.560> having<00:01:52.830> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
shotgun but when you guys having a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.650 
shotgun but when you guys having a
sorrowful<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.459> you're<00:01:53.640> getting<00:01:53.729> shot<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.209> your

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
sorrowful on you're getting shot at your

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.389 
sorrowful on you're getting shot at your
crosshair<00:01:55.140> flies<00:01:55.470> off<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.830> screen<00:01:56.039> guys<00:01:56.220> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
crosshair flies off the screen guys it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.559 
crosshair flies off the screen guys it
is<00:01:56.489> so<00:01:56.670> hard<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.910> get<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> kill<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.420> getting

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
is so hard to get a kill what getting

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.359 
is so hard to get a kill what getting
shots<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> its<00:01:58.470> really<00:01:58.649> irritating<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.280> they

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
shots and its really irritating if they

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.740 
shots and its really irritating if they
add<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.489> toughness<00:01:59.789> in<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.239> think<00:02:00.630> would<00:02:00.690> make

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
add a toughness in I think would make

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.059 
add a toughness in I think would make
the<00:02:00.929> game<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.110> lot<00:02:01.289> more<00:02:01.470> fun<00:02:01.679> a<00:02:01.739> lot<00:02:01.920> more

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
the game a lot more fun a lot more

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.800 
the game a lot more fun a lot more
enjoyable<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.119> wouldn't<00:02:03.330> really<00:02:03.450> rage<00:02:03.690> as

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
enjoyable and I wouldn't really rage as

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.999 
enjoyable and I wouldn't really rage as
much<00:02:03.959> because<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.289> feel<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
much because I feel like some of the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.949 
much because I feel like some of the
deaths<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.270> justified<00:02:06.750> you

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099

so<00:02:19.409> far<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.769> game<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.099> me<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> think<00:02:20.670> it's

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
so far the game to me I think it's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.580 
so far the game to me I think it's
really<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> are<00:02:21.329> based<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.900> SMGs<00:02:22.349> aren't

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
really a are based the SMGs aren't

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
really a are based the SMGs aren't
really<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.890> good<00:02:23.099> I've<00:02:23.549> used<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:23.999> of<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
really that good I've used one of the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.759 
really that good I've used one of the
shotguns<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.629> one<00:02:24.749> of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.870> snipers<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.739> I

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
shotguns and one of the snipers so I

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.929 
shotguns and one of the snipers so I
can't<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.069> give<00:02:26.249> my<00:02:26.340> opinion<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.790> those

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
can't really give my opinion on those

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.000 
can't really give my opinion on those
things<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.170> between<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.530> SMGs<00:02:28.889> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
things but just between the SMGs and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.770 
things but just between the SMGs and
sorry<00:02:29.219> falls<00:02:29.459> i<00:02:29.549> think<00:02:29.760> ARS<00:02:30.269> are<00:02:30.389> definitely

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
sorry falls i think ARS are definitely

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.420 
sorry falls i think ARS are definitely
the<00:02:30.870> way<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.019> go<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.680> pick<00:02:31.889> people<00:02:32.129> off<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.249> long

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the way to go you pick people off a long

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.739 
the way to go you pick people off a long
range<00:02:32.609> close<00:02:33.150> range<00:02:33.420> they're<00:02:33.569> really

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:33.749 
range close range they're really

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.569 
range close range they're really
dominant<00:02:34.079> so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.739> think<00:02:34.859> this<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.189> really

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579
