00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello friends today again a new one 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.750
 I am showing you trading today 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.450
 how to deal with in-form players 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.099
 have been here last week so a 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.369
 few colleagues bought from the team of 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.429
 week and I'll show you how 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.730
 the value is so I have 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:29.050
 gero bought more for 9,900 in the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.949
 lineup 4 2 3 1 and I have it here 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.470
 ever entered 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.289
 Now look what's worth today , then 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:41.170
 when I would put them in now 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:44.530
 there are none under 16 1750 and if 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.679
 The guy really wants to have no one then 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.679
 I can just repel him for 9394 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:54.370
 and i have very minimal loss and 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.769
 I think for 11,000 you will be so everyone 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.199
 Something important in the form of a player at some point 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.850
 The exhibition does not buy every one 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.039
 shit it would have to be at least one 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.660
 so be four with him 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.400
 to begin 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.150
 of course, here is something like 442 optimally 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.150
 always in high demand 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:19.700
 4 2 3 1 4 2 2 2 is okay we will be 4 again 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:22.310
 4 2 4 2 3 1 does not buy anything with 334 2 1 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.960
 or summer ultimately the one problem 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.700
 have that for sale 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.300
 unless you pick a player 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.550
 the really a eighties in the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.590
 Eighties too low and 85 he is too 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.600
 even higher if he gets that for 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.370
 10,000 then probably he will too 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 to go away in another formation 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.750
 so now look what it is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:53.300
 colleague has first goalkeeper in 442 in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.300
 brazil brazil brazil 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:04.560
 so 20,000 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:09.600
 16 7 15 ok so still quite cheap with 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.210
 11 32 25 so the trend looks strong 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.940
 he somehow up the price 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.620
 missed right away or a bit 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.390
 tight fund in any case if you 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.980
 you buy these people and just one 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
 for two weeks , the price will decrease 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.450
 these players are going to be here at the top 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.410
 They'll probably never be back 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.430
 in shape easily fits a random 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.120
 that was in shape here 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.770
 while robben or messi probably 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.830
 more often get in shape and then the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.500
 Old in shape for the price 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.660
 We still have something for which I have 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.530
 Only in 423 just watching me 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.530
 we are very up to date 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.590
 14 45 and 15 12 50 exactly the same 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.820
 trend so now the question as finds 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.340
 one uses these players here 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.610
 all back 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.920
 Team of the week is known where to find that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.260
 has to find and I always do it that way 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.110
 I give here just a minimum price 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.230
 8,000 to 11,000 gold players and then 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.640
 I go looking for it 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.470
 So here is only once have nothing here 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.099
 We would be the first in shape 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.360
 of course a fucking show 343 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.040
 will probably not be human later 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.440
 want to have 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.690
 So that was the outside of here mine 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.799
 stÃ¼rmer also crappy lineup 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.799
 finger off so remains for me 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.170
 maybe a little bit more 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.450
 defender 451 is borderline the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.400
 Exhibition is alright but it is not 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.300
 The Oberhammer tempo is not great 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.020
 defense looks so great 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.250
 Well, I just offer 10 and to 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.420
 not just repels him 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.750
 something we have a striker to 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.640
 I would also advise against reformation 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.620
 do not walk well 4 3 2 1 that 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.150
 is a lineup that would be okay 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.130
 the price is almost a bit too 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.549
 would be high but you could also for him 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.500
 Buy 11 and just wait two weeks 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.820
 then he would have to go over but me 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.120
 actually prefer to stay in the 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.250
 tens of thousands of variants because if I then 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.000
 really have to repel I have 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.000
 not such a big loss 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.020
 so we need to have in 52 21 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.370
 It's not that easy 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:50.249
 which he is here to find 4411 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.369
 okay and I simply offer time 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.739
 though his death is always the gatekeeper 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.059
 such a thing is usually not 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:00.799
 as good as a striker 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:04.609
 defender or midfielder 

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:04.609
 still a defender 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.829
 okay, I just offer it 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:21.440
 weather it does not continue here 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:25.509
 easy to find these people because you 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.509
 always go down in the swirl 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.729
 the exhibition is okay but the price 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.250
 it is too high 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.300
 I'm looking for bargains as he here so 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.300
 cellars are bargains 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.800
 so we look even arrive 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.600
 where plays which league holland 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.930
 holland league i do not think so 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.930
 asked 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:06:00.460
 Of course, here is the thing rs 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:05.560
 Center-forward in formation there are 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.520
 actually not a mediocre would 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.240
 I also let my fingers off 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.810
 actually just what we need to re 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.810
 colleagues 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.139
 he is okay because offer it again 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:25.720
 okay he has about a feeling like that 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.870
 whole is to tackle and I see we 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.680
 have already been offered 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.080
 Ultimately, these will be in shape 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.370
 players in the price rise in any case 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.530
 it's just a question of time you 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.840
 but need a pack 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.620
 investment if you just work without it 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.180
 wants to earn money 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.180
 ok friends that's it's good
