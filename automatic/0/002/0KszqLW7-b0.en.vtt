 the hijacker 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.910
 that insignificant 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.750
 because 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 all around the world 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.590

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 if you do not like people 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 I'll start first. 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.420
 in the case of security 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.070
 our power 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.540
 while the new mandate 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.710
 hehehehe 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.900
 What did they do with it? 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.400
 here is this one 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.870
 that part that she 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 is different from the others in another team 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.500
 after April 15 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.960
 and they get very large beans also get very large and I can not 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.180
 it is normal the process 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.489
 this one you guys had even infinite 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.489
 and there you can use 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.939
 other vaccines and tatiane 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 according to the same way 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.659
 for you take someone simple dialogue 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.129
 very complicated 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.289
 Jessica gets nothing 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.289
 it's much better that you use that power 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 use 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.849
 - this attitude shows you that this cordon is much more than the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.189
 worry 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.940
 the great ovation that is heading the game 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.940
 brook lopez in space 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.449
 for his reasons 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.409

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.269
 there will be 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.409
 if all the magic Bahia tried but comfortable to 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.649
 because I did not have it 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.939
 the teacher could not because it is not so tasty dry grass 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.519

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.569
 argued with the kardec song 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.469
 I like to use the earth. 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.399

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.399
 they get sick there 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.349
