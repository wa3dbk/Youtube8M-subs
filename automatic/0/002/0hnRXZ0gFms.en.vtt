00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.720
 that state many of these questions and why that's why the following 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.270
 report that really 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.630
 apparently the prize of the future the most modern computer technologies 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.630
 applied to education 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.339
 in each market 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.409
 Information and communication technologies are not a formula 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:21.220
 magical 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.720
 but they can improve the lives of all the inhabitants of the planet have 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.200
 instruments that will advance freedom and democracy and means 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.580
 to spread knowledge and facilitate its understanding 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.820
 these words that belong to kofi annan when he was secretary of the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.690
 united nations in milan 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 in interview today seven years later 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.410
 we live in the flesh the presence of calls here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.420
 Information and communication technologies 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
 airs 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.870
 We travel to Madrid Spain 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.400
 to the fifth congress in USA renew at school 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 the central theme 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 how to integrate tics in the classroom 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.479
 European reality is very different from ours, it really shows us what 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.400
 she happened on pillar 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 to use this blackboard 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 for example if we are in science class 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 in the Mediterranean area 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.070
 posters 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.900
 we visited schools in madrid 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.990
 and teachers who are already experts using these tools 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.410
 cut 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.890
 the first husband who was waiting 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.969
 but none of these was held to justify state 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.070
 for this the delegate 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.620
 it also provides digitized so that we can also put it in 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.090
 the blackboard this has several advantages the first 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.370
 correct them for exercises 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 the students of the blackboard the same as they have art books 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.809
 and then breathing father 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.809
 that team of 46 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.939
 the subject has paschal suspicions 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.900
 technology has gone to the education system 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.000
 adapting to the digital system four years ago the Spanish public schools 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.439
 applies them 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.150
 it is amazing to see how these children grow in the digital world 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.239
 2 - when they wake up two weeks before moving 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.239
 it connects to the computer are the photos from the previous night 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.219
 in the week text messages on the way to school when they arrive at school 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.069
 The bell rings suddenly to enter the school and entered the tunnel of the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.679
 weather 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.139
 suddenly enters a space 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.579
 e a person climbed on a wooden platform hosts a chalk 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.219
 write on a blackboard 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.489
 the students finally talked in a 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.869
 vernon who takes a bowl inscribe 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.989
 in it in the notebook and so during the Maria Sorace of the pendulum sound the 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:09.689
 doorbell 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.759
 they leave again go through the tunnel time and return to a world surrounded by 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.219
 dispositives 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.149
 digital and internet content 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.440
 but the reality in Peru is different 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.649
 a poor country 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:25.879
 with state investment in public education even as a villa 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.909
 the private sector show us experiences like the educated fables 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.629
 of telephone foundation 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.780
 windows and current that open the doors of the world to thousands of students and 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.809
 teachers

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.369
 the cdl 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.349
 what they did not know or internet 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.169
 thereafter, a person delegated the power and existence of 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.169
 training also 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.719
 the processor of Isabella II 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.440
 that day 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.989
 so that the two tennis players 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.989
 ferreira leite 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.949
 then I said to myself 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.859
 the Melillenses Nowitzki 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.629

 i is happy on the internet 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.249
 to 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.710
 enter there 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.259
 and if that 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.100
 the tie 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.499
 he could not share either 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.210
 The other side of the world 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.720
 our assembly chalk runs replace by efe 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.330
 also the radio 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
 and although the teacher preparation time 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:41.870
 with the knuckle 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.870
 with mine 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:47.999
 the udinese born 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.999
 and now I work 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.319
 what you need 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.319
 use them in large Italian companies 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.300
 last july 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.300
 the prayer was passed at least 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.400
 the reluctance that exists because they do not know the elders have to do with their 

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:10.680
 resistance to change and fear of the unknown 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 as soon as they know it and unincorporated united they are delighted 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.979
 Peruvian professors show great interest in the technologies of the 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.819
 Information and communication 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.860
 you want leftover congress was broadcast live through the business website 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.889
 progressed Peruvians decided immediately jorge drexler congress 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.159
 open at the same time why we are doing 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.250
 the first 300 teachers who participated in it as usual 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:36.330
 they were Peruvian 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.520
 I heard that the edo 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.740
 the 14 thousand people at the moment are 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.480
 virtually witnessing this encounter is done with heather 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.419
 with reality 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.080
 from Peru who remain this moment 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.349
 of these 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.289
 the order and 411 1 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.479
 he is witnessing 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.619
 I say 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.009
 the whole process from Lima 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.009
 asks for data especially in provinces 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.250
 the director of Milan 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.470
 had the opportunity to train in madrid she tries to replicate what 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.270
 learned is still surprised 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.270
 I'm surprised that the tables in the virtual classrooms 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.839
 she teachers work 16 years very fine 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.489
 face that the children also prepare their classes 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.949
 I put about ten days 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.949
 project and expose 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.180
 you do not have to have 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.599
 will perform all classes and tablets 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.960
 with everything you have you can do many things and you can 

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.020
 move along 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.340
 our famous computers more speculations 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.180
 with any excuse that we have although there is no connection 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.699
 always knowing that it is not 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.169
 exposed maximum but with any device that is made out jes√∫s
