got to do what we have to do no matter
what<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.850> conditions<00:04:14.060> are<00:04:14.420> in<00:04:14.569> Phil<00:04:14.840> no

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
what the conditions are in Phil no

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.259

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
matter who we're facing and collectively

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.229 
matter who we're facing and collectively
we<00:04:17.480> just<00:04:17.630> haven't<00:04:17.900> done<00:04:18.019> that<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.320> year<00:04:19.239> they

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
we just haven't done that this year they

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.550 
we just haven't done that this year they
come<00:04:20.419> out<00:04:20.570> every<00:04:20.600> week<00:04:21.109> has<00:04:21.290> it<00:04:21.410> been

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
come out every week has it been

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.710 
come out every week has it been
difficult<00:04:21.730> navigating<00:04:22.730> I<00:04:22.820> guess<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.330> social

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
difficult navigating I guess the social

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.540 
difficult navigating I guess the social
aspects<00:04:24.139> of<00:04:24.260> being<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.650> NFL<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.250> all<00:04:25.370> that

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
aspects of being in the NFL and all that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.580 
aspects of being in the NFL and all that
no<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.060> mean<00:04:26.330> it's<00:04:26.480> it's<00:04:26.660> not<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.470> know

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
no I mean it's it's not and you know

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.980 
no I mean it's it's not and you know
it's<00:04:27.980> not<00:04:28.100> like<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:29.330> certainly<00:04:29.780> wasn't

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
it's not like that it certainly wasn't

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.210 
it's not like that it certainly wasn't
like<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.260> last<00:04:30.500> year<00:04:30.680> even<00:04:30.860> when<00:04:31.100> we're

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
like that last year even when we're

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.950 
like that last year even when we're
sitting<00:04:31.460> at<00:04:31.490> three<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.790> six<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.480> don't<00:04:32.870> know

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
sitting at three and six so I don't know

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.600 
sitting at three and six so I don't know
what's<00:04:33.139> going<00:04:33.410> on<00:04:33.500> this<00:04:33.650> year<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.100> it's

what's going on this year it's it's

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.670 
what's going on this year it's it's
pretty<00:04:34.850> crazy<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:35.450> at<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:36.200> same<00:04:36.410> time<00:04:36.620> i

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
pretty crazy but at the same time i

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.740 
pretty crazy but at the same time i
don't<00:04:36.830> i<00:04:37.100> know<00:04:37.220> i<00:04:37.340> don't<00:04:37.669> see<00:04:38.389> any<00:04:38.510> of<00:04:38.630> that

stuff<00:04:38.900> before<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.410> game<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.860> i<00:04:40.130> don't<00:04:40.310> know

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
stuff before the game and i don't know

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.950

if the other players do or not i can
only<00:04:42.169> speak<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.620> myself<00:04:42.770> in<00:04:43.160> that<00:04:43.280> sense<00:04:43.610> but

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
only speak for myself in that sense but

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.659 
only speak for myself in that sense but
it<00:04:45.140> certainly<00:04:45.350> didn't<00:04:45.710> affect<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.280> know<00:04:46.490> what

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
it certainly didn't affect you know what
