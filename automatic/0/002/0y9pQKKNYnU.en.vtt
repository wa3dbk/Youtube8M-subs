how to make objects admit light in
bender<00:00:05.150> Endor<00:00:05.450> lots<00:00:05.660> of<00:00:05.690> people<00:00:05.930> show<00:00:06.230> it<00:00:06.380> in

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
two objects I'm using at the moment to

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.229 
two objects I'm using at the moment to
admit<00:00:22.249> light<00:00:22.429> as<00:00:22.579> you<00:00:22.669> can<00:00:22.759> see<00:00:22.909> the<00:00:22.999> brighter

I make the image the more I made the

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.529 
I make the image the more I made the
object<00:00:26.839> a<00:00:26.929> bit<00:00:27.169> like<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:27.499> brighter<00:00:27.769> it<00:00:27.949> gets

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
don't need light source because our cube

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.169 
don't need light source because our cube
will<00:01:00.980> be<00:01:01.100> our<00:01:01.280> light<00:01:01.429> source<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:01.850> right<00:01:01.999> now

floor wide the floor wasn't white
earlier<00:01:08.240> but<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.480> kind<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.870> know<00:01:09.050> will<00:01:09.200> help

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
earlier but I kind of you know will help

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.730 
earlier but I kind of you know will help
it<00:01:09.620> reflect<00:01:10.010> more<00:01:13.390> light<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.170> form<00:01:15.590> I'd

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
it reflect more light on that form I'd

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.020 
it reflect more light on that form I'd
be<00:01:15.830> able<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.980> reflect<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.640> little<00:01:16.730> bit<00:01:16.850> more

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
be able to reflect a little bit more

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.690 
be able to reflect a little bit more
alright<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:17.540> going<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.900> your<00:01:17.990> object<00:01:18.410> so<00:01:19.040> you

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
alright so going to your object so you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.900 
alright so going to your object so you
probably<00:01:19.910> know<00:01:20.300> this<00:01:20.450> but<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:22.130> turn<00:01:22.400> go

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
probably know this but but you turn go

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.400 
probably know this but but you turn go
into<00:01:23.090> shading<00:01:23.480> in<00:01:23.600> turn<00:01:23.780> admit<00:01:24.080> er<00:01:24.110> to

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
into shading in turn admit er to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.130 
into shading in turn admit er to
whatever<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.040> want<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.460> as<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.700> can<00:01:25.790> see

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
whatever you want and as you can see

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.810 
whatever you want and as you can see
that's<00:01:27.140> getting<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.440> bit<00:01:27.470> brighter<00:01:27.800> but<00:01:28.040> it's

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
that's getting a bit brighter but it's

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.390 
that's getting a bit brighter but it's
not<00:01:29.030> admitting<00:01:29.810> any<00:01:30.020> light<00:01:30.410> source<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:31.100> just

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
not admitting any light source is just

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
not admitting any light source is just
getting<00:01:32.330> it's<00:01:32.600> just<00:01:33.610> being<00:01:34.610> light<00:01:34.940> itself

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
getting it's just being light itself

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.570 
getting it's just being light itself
we're<00:01:35.690> not<00:01:35.810> admitting<00:01:36.200> anything<00:01:36.520> all<00:01:37.520> right

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
we're not admitting anything all right

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.280 
we're not admitting anything all right
there's<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> bit<00:01:38.540> brighter<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.170> that

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
there's a bit brighter here like that

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.250 
there's a bit brighter here like that
alright<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.520> way<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.670> do<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.840> all

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
alright so the way you do it this is all

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.230 
alright so the way you do it this is all
you<00:01:42.290> got<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.530> do<00:01:42.620> after<00:01:42.890> doing<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.240> indirect

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
you got to do after doing that indirect

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.500 
you got to do after doing that indirect
light<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:45.370> approximate<00:01:46.370> turn<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:46.970> up<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.210> maybe

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
light in approximate turn it up to maybe

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.350 
light in approximate turn it up to maybe
two<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:49.430> won't<00:01:49.670> matter<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.180> thing

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
two it won't matter in this thing

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.460 
two it won't matter in this thing
because<00:01:50.510> it's<00:01:50.690> not<00:01:50.810> gonna<00:01:50.930> bounce<00:01:51.140> sort<00:01:51.410> of

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
because it's not gonna bounce sort of

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.660 
because it's not gonna bounce sort of
funny<00:01:51.680> think<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.870> that's<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.380> take<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.280> picture

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
funny think and that's it take a picture

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.490 
funny think and that's it take a picture
