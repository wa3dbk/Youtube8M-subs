00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
debating between the black and the nude
by<00:02:02.880> figure<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.630> went<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.200> nude<00:02:04.380> instead

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
by figure I went with the nude instead

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.960 
by figure I went with the nude instead
because<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.670> was

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
because it was

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.340 
because it was
summer<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.740> spring<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.540> figured<00:02:09.540> be<00:02:09.750> nice<00:02:09.990> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.380 
why I kind of waited too for the stores
to<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.430> them<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.270> afraid

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
to get them in because I was afraid

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630

I<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.320> really<00:02:52.709> confused<00:02:53.160> when<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.850> first<00:02:54.150> got

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
I was really confused when I first got

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.020 
I was really confused when I first got
them<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.930> was<00:02:55.260> putting<00:02:55.890> them<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> home<00:02:56.490> trying

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
them I was putting them on a home trying

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.900 
them I was putting them on a home trying
them<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.300> constantly<00:02:58.080> every<00:02:58.370> play<00:02:59.370> every<00:02:59.880> day

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
them on constantly every play every day

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.780 
them on constantly every play every day
and<00:03:00.890> debating<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.070> had<00:03:02.220> gone<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.640> right

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and debating if I had gone the right

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.680 
and debating if I had gone the right
size<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.390> not<00:03:03.540> because<00:03:04.530> my<00:03:05.340> toes<00:03:05.850> were<00:03:06.360> so

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
size or not because my toes were so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.770 
size or not because my toes were so
squished<00:03:07.230> when<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.100> put<00:03:08.459> them<00:03:08.580> on<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:09.420> because

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
squished when I put them on just because

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.900 
squished when I put them on just because
of<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.230> toe<00:03:11.040> box<00:03:11.310> area<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:13.220> mean<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.519> it's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
of the toe box area I mean it's it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.410 
of the toe box area I mean it's it's
fairly<00:03:15.269> narrow<00:03:15.890> um<00:03:16.890> now<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.610> don't<00:03:17.700> think<00:03:18.239> my

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
fairly narrow um now I don't think my

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.560 
fairly narrow um now I don't think my
feet<00:03:18.720> are<00:03:19.250> skinnier<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.670> fat<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.090> would

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
feet are skinnier or fat I would

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.190 
feet are skinnier or fat I would
consider<00:03:22.050> my<00:03:22.230> feet<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:23.040> pretty<00:03:23.550> average<00:03:24.200> so

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
consider my feet to be pretty average so

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.860 
consider my feet to be pretty average so
putting<00:03:25.800> them<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.519> was<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.239> hesitant<00:03:27.450> about

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
putting them on I was so hesitant about

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.720 
putting them on I was so hesitant about
even<00:03:28.320> going<00:03:28.590> back<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.980> exchange<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.489> for<00:03:29.519> an

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
even going back to exchange it for an

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.970 
even going back to exchange it for an
eight<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> half<00:03:30.300> or<00:03:30.540> even<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.840> size<00:03:31.050> nine<00:03:31.470> so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
eight and a half or even a size nine so

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.009 
eight and a half or even a size nine so
I<00:03:32.010> was<00:03:32.250> happy<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.180> stuck<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.780> eight

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
I was happy that I stuck with the eight

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.600 
I was happy that I stuck with the eight
after<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> while<00:03:35.160> because<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.940> decided<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.610> you

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
really happy with the 8 because there's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.670 
really happy with the 8 because there's
also<00:04:54.250> no<00:04:54.610> heel<00:04:54.910> gap<00:04:55.180> for<00:04:55.420> me<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:55.780> know<00:04:56.320> with<00:04:56.650> a

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
also no heel gap for me I know with a

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.740

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.640 
lot of these shoes some people get some
and<00:04:59.020> because<00:04:59.770> the<00:05:00.000> steepness<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.420> it<00:05:01.650> your

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.600 
and because the steepness of it your
feet<00:05:02.890> do<00:05:03.100> slip<00:05:04.020> quite<00:05:05.100> significantly<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.220> would

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
feet do slip quite significantly I would

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.040 
feet do slip quite significantly I would
think<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.450> with<00:05:08.440> 8<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:10.030> don't<00:05:10.570> kind<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.870> heel

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
think and with 8 I don't kind of heel

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.870 
think and with 8 I don't kind of heel
gap<00:05:11.320> at<00:05:11.530> all<00:05:11.590> so<00:05:12.100> I<00:05:12.130> know<00:05:12.250> at<00:05:12.550> least<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:12.820> know

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
gap at all so I know at least I know

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.930 
gap at all so I know at least I know
once<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.480> does<00:05:13.600> stretch<00:05:13.870> out<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:15.460> know<00:05:15.580> to

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
once it does stretch out to you know to

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.150 
once it does stretch out to you know to
fit<00:05:16.120> me<00:05:16.240> perfectly<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:17.020> won't<00:05:17.680> have<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.920> worry

anyone that knows whether you wear shoes

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.880 
anyone that knows whether you wear shoes
that<00:05:22.960> are<00:05:23.020> probably<00:05:23.230> bigger<00:05:23.380> than<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.620> feet

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
that are probably bigger than the feet

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.620 
that are probably bigger than the feet
you've<00:05:24.100> got<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.310> kind<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.610> print<00:05:25.000> your<00:05:25.300> your

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
toes a big and it's not comfortable so

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.550 
toes a big and it's not comfortable so
that's<00:05:30.190> why<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.520> would<00:05:30.790> suggest<00:05:31.140> try<00:05:32.140> these<00:05:32.200> on
