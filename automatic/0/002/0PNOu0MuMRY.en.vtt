00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
it's gonna be bad positioning of these

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.160 
it's gonna be bad positioning of these
Marines<00:02:06.179> as<00:02:06.300> well<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.630> stutter<00:02:06.869> stepping

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
Marines as well and the stutter stepping

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
Marines as well and the stutter stepping
but<00:02:07.979> these<00:02:08.130> extra<00:02:08.429> turns<00:02:08.610> hehe<00:02:08.910> might<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
but these extra turns hehe might be

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
but these extra turns hehe might be
forced<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> cancel<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.990> yeah<00:02:10.349> he's<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.860> too

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
forced to cancel one yeah he's just too

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.860 
forced to cancel one yeah he's just too
late<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.340> barracks<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.940> significantly<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
late this barracks so significantly I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.180 
late this barracks so significantly I
think<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.440> gonna<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.709> cancel<00:02:13.830> at<00:02:14.069> this

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
think is gonna have to cancel at this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.150 
think is gonna have to cancel at this
point<00:02:14.930> looks<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.080> landing<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.560> even<00:02:16.860> loses

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
point looks like landing on even loses

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.740 
point looks like landing on even loses
the<00:02:17.280> SCV<00:02:17.670> definitely<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> cancel<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750

delayed even if he does finish it the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.470 
delayed even if he does finish it the
finishing<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.030> question<00:02:27.150> when

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
finishing is out of the question when

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600 
finishing is out of the question when
he's<00:02:27.569> got<00:02:27.690> no<00:02:27.840> SUV<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.230> nearby<00:02:28.410> he<00:02:29.250> hasn't

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.089 
he's got no SUV is nearby he hasn't
cancelled<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.090> yet<00:02:30.620> guess<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.800> waiting<00:02:32.010> for

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099
