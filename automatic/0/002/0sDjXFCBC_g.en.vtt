what I've done this time is I've got my
basic<00:00:07.740> shapes<00:00:08.069> cut<00:00:08.580> out<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.290> set<00:00:10.290> up<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.969> went

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
basic shapes cut out and set up I went

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.600 
basic shapes cut out and set up I went
ahead<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> add<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.440> third<00:00:13.860> tier

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
ahead and I'm going to add a third tier

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.810 
ahead and I'm going to add a third tier
on<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.299> side<00:00:15.630> I'm<00:00:16.470> looking<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> real<00:00:17.279> flow

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
on one side I'm looking for a real flow

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.910 
on one side I'm looking for a real flow
to<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.270> piece<00:00:18.600> again<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.230> angle<00:00:19.619> sort<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
to this piece again the angle sort of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.290 
to this piece again the angle sort of
thing<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.250> supposed<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.699> monastery

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
thing that's supposed to be a monastery

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.019 
thing that's supposed to be a monastery
of<00:00:21.480> some<00:00:21.750> kind<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.800> there's<00:00:23.220> certain<00:00:23.519> elements

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
of some kind so there's certain elements

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.750 
of some kind so there's certain elements
that<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.210> wanted<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> include<00:00:25.519> so<00:00:26.519> I've<00:00:26.609> decided

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that I wanted to include so I've decided

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
that I wanted to include so I've decided
the<00:00:27.210> flow<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> piece<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the flow of the piece it's going to be

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.230 
the flow of the piece it's going to be
like<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.980> there's<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.519> stairs<00:00:29.880> up

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
like this there's going to be stairs up

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.400 
like this there's going to be stairs up
and<00:00:30.740> then<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.980> pathway<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> stone

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and then a pathway and then like a stone

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.799 
and then a pathway and then like a stone
gate<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.040> you'll<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.250> momentarily<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
gate which you'll see momentarily and it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
gate which you'll see momentarily and it
will<00:00:36.930> come<00:00:37.110> back<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> path<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.460> then

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
will come back down to a path and then

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450 
will come back down to a path and then
what<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> did<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.809> cut<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.320> off<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.280> there

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
what I did is I cut these off so there

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.660 
what I did is I cut these off so there
would<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:42.090> open<00:00:42.690> space<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:44.010> complete

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
would be an open space here to complete

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.479 
would be an open space here to complete
the<00:00:45.270> loop<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> did<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.530> using<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:47.280> belt

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the loop what I did was using my belt

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.069 
the loop what I did was using my belt
sander<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.239> created<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.200> nifty<00:00:49.800> shapes<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
sander I created these nifty shapes and

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.250 
sander I created these nifty shapes and
how<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.110> did<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.360> cut<00:00:54.360> two<00:00:54.600> blocks<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
how i did it was I cut two blocks to the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.099 
how i did it was I cut two blocks to the
same<00:00:55.590> size<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.250> put<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.120> together<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.870> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
same size I put them together like this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.660 
same size I put them together like this
and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.850> pressed<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
and then I just pressed it down on this

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.479 
and then I just pressed it down on this
curved<00:01:02.670> end<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.890> great<00:01:05.159> tool

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
curved end this is a really great tool

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.929 
curved end this is a really great tool
for<00:01:05.519> shaping<00:01:06.170> styrofoam<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.619> end<00:01:08.250> part<00:01:08.670> here

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
for shaping styrofoam this end part here

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.300 
for shaping styrofoam this end part here
where<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> goes<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> cylinder

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
where it goes around the cylinder

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
where it goes around the cylinder
additionally<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> cut<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:11.880> smaller<00:01:12.320> pieces

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
additionally I cut some smaller pieces

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
additionally I cut some smaller pieces
and<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.189> made<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> same<00:01:14.820> shape<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.930> be

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and I made the same shape which will be

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.859 
and I made the same shape which will be
repeated<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.740> standing<00:01:17.280> stones<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.509> on

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
repeated as standing stones on the on

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
repeated as standing stones on the on
the<00:01:19.549> display<00:01:20.549> board<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.580> took<00:01:23.580> some

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the display board so then I took some

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
the display board so then I took some
sandpaper<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> give

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
sandpaper and because i want to give

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 
sandpaper and because i want to give
these<00:01:26.040> stone<00:01:26.670> blocks<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.299> natural<00:01:27.900> shape<00:01:28.439> i

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
these stone blocks a natural shape i

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030 
these stone blocks a natural shape i
just<00:01:29.340> sanded<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:30.200> roughly<00:01:31.200> around<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
just sanded them roughly around the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.880 
just sanded them roughly around the
edges<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.850> medium<00:01:33.360> grit<00:01:33.659> sandpaper<00:01:34.170> seems

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
edges I like medium grit sandpaper seems

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
edges I like medium grit sandpaper seems
to<00:01:35.100> work<00:01:35.250> pretty<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.630> too<00:01:36.840> low

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
to work pretty well if you get too low

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
to work pretty well if you get too low
of<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.380> great<00:01:37.650> you'll<00:01:37.860> end<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.100> sanding<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
of a great you'll end up sanding and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
of a great you'll end up sanding and
sanding<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.180> sanding<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
sanding and sanding and if you get to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.600 
sanding and sanding and if you get to
course<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.759> grit<00:01:42.170> it'll<00:01:43.170> end<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.610> ripping

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
course of a grit it'll end up ripping

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.600 
course of a grit it'll end up ripping
your<00:01:45.090> styrofoam<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.990> giving<00:01:46.439> the

your styrofoam and giving the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
your styrofoam and giving the
irregularities<00:01:47.610> which<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:48.470> make<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.530> harder

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
irregularities which will make it harder

irregularities which will make it harder
for<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.250> later<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.360> wanted<00:01:51.659> these

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
for you later on now if I wanted these

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.850 
for you later on now if I wanted these
to<00:01:51.899> look<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.070> were<00:01:53.100> two<00:01:53.549> stone<00:01:54.270> blocks

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
to look like they were two stone blocks

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.859 
to look like they were two stone blocks
balanced<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.950> top<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.430> each<00:01:56.549> other<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.689> will

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
balanced on top of each other which will

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.020 
balanced on top of each other which will
add<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.259> narrative<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> piece<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.520> could

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
add the narrative of the piece I could

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.800 
add the narrative of the piece I could
take<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> soldering<00:02:00.719> iron<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.439> burn<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.189> an

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810 
take a soldering iron and burn in an
illusionary<00:02:03.810> crack<00:02:04.380> there<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.610> case

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
illusionary crack there but in this case

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.130 
illusionary crack there but in this case
I'm<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.270> ahead<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.630> take<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
I'm going to go ahead and just take the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.280 
I'm going to go ahead and just take the
edge<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.670> sandpaper<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:10.880> work<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.480> crack

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
edge of my sandpaper and work in a crack

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.770 
edge of my sandpaper and work in a crack
I<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.620> know<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I don't know if you can see that and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.440 
I don't know if you can see that and
then<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.080> will<00:02:16.200> form<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> illusion<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.580> two

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
then that will form the illusion of two

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
then that will form the illusion of two
blocks<00:02:19.280> standing<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.490> top<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.090> each<00:02:21.390> other<00:02:25.730> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
blocks standing on top of each other and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.480 
blocks standing on top of each other and
then<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.330> course<00:02:27.360> i'll<00:02:27.810> go<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.709> round<00:02:29.190> off<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
then of course i'll go and round off the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.920 
then of course i'll go and round off the
corners<00:02:30.170> where<00:02:31.459> they've<00:02:32.459> naturally<00:02:33.180> warm

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
corners where they've naturally warm

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.220 
corners where they've naturally warm
together<00:02:34.970> that's<00:02:35.970> really<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.510> key<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.050> making

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
together that's really the key to making

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.770 
together that's really the key to making
terrain<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.980> what<00:02:38.130> i<00:02:38.160> call<00:02:38.400> narrative<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
terrain is what i call narrative is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.800 
terrain is what i call narrative is
there<00:02:40.230> there<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.130> elements<00:02:41.910> where

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
there there have to be elements where

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.410 
there there have to be elements where
the<00:02:43.709> person<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.130> transported<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.180> other

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the person is transported to this other

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.090 
the person is transported to this other
world<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:48.750> tell<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> story<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.709> little

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
world that that tell a story a little

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.979 
world that that tell a story a little
rat<00:02:50.400> coming<00:02:50.820> out<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.090> sewer<00:02:51.300> pipe<00:02:51.600> that's

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
rat coming out of a sewer pipe that's

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.860 
rat coming out of a sewer pipe that's
narrative<00:02:52.650> these<00:02:53.190> blocks<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:54.420> cut<00:02:54.840> here

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
narrative these blocks this cut here

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.900 
narrative these blocks this cut here
that's<00:02:55.410> narrative<00:02:55.980> there<00:02:56.160> was<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> stone<00:02:56.610> block

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
that's narrative there was a stone block

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.250 
that's narrative there was a stone block
on<00:02:57.209> top<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.440> another<00:02:58.650> one
