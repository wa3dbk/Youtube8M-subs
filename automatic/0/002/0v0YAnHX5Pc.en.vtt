00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 very good people and are welcome to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.260
 another video more from my channel 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.960
 well, this video will be a video 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.090
 little special because it will deal with items 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.220
 that you can not get in a service 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.349
 of terror since it means this that 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.939
 no matter how much I search for the fret 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.600
 try to make yourself a monster 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.960
 Well you will not get it and well then 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.119
 let's start already good first thing 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.190
 they are armor and I have them in this 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.800
 chest but I will zoom so that they can 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.930
 see better then good and open the chest 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.940
 well to show you things as I said 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.970
 well fail you see that I did not have them in 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.090
 this chest I was wrong a little good 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 here are all the armors 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.070
 Well first I will tell you the name of the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.970
 armor and then I'll tell you what each 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.000
 a 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.700
 good are the network kit the kit 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.820
 crown or the gym kit the aaron kit 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.820
 tip of sen the keep the wild and the kit 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.280
 tom and good these armor simply 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 can not be obtained and used because 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.390
 are the armors of the creators of 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.479
 game made for the creators of the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.850
 game and then neither can anyone 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.030
 use it since each armor then adds 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.610
 look for it makes impossible the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.090
 survival of the player having this 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.659
 bet or is the armor so then 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.240
 I will keep an armor to show you 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.540
 and you download the zoom 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.579
 Well here we are and now 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.740
 I will show what happens when 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.720
 this armor like all the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.600
 others is placed in your inventory of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.580
 armor equipment 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.840
 good can you start if you put in 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.729
 any of these fragments of 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.740
 Armor will give you a lot of debut 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.649
 as I said that it will cause the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.340
 player to the player then die after 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.770
 to have it for some time now look 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 see how it happens there, then add a 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 debut and he has killed me because you 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.530
 start to get a lot of good life 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.400
 I will quickly remove goodbye to kill you again 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.060
 I will give life 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.080
 for 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.680
 well all this I do thanks to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.769
 server and I now try the rooms 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.579
 according to a wiki that I have read you allow 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.269
 fly infinitely through walls and 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.269
 run at high speed 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.140
 faster than germ boots like that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.300
 that good can prove that what 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.300
 happens when the network wings are put 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.580
 will happen the same as with the rest of the 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.340
 armor and well then I'll leave everything here 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.349
 where I was and I'll show you the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.720
 other objects that can be 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.120
 used 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.130
 and they can be used rather 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.319
 to trolling on servers and others 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.530
 well to start we have 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.349
 the gravity what would be the balloon 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.719
 gravitation is like a sphere of these 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.909
 that if you move them to the effect like that 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.889
 if it's snowing inside of her and good 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.040
 what this does to you is change 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.439
 gravity infinitely but while 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.450
 you are using this object not 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.030
 they can change their address like 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.639
 position or once they pressed the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.590
 double to change the gravity because no 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.610
 there is no turning back but here is in a 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.520
 roof you can not 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.650
 change the severity again until 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.380
 you get to the end of the good map them 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.150
 I will show how to see now it can be 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.600
 changed the severity and I do not have any 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.480
 debut here I do not have any debut and the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.760
 will change again the change to 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.270
 change the change the change and then good 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.770
 has infinite and good function I will not go 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.230
 up everything to not do more 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.940
 long the video but good you know that that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.830
 once the severity has changed 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.560
 they can not change again until 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.230
 that touch the ground and good now let's go 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.310
 with the other object leave this here in the 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:16.440
 chest and I will go through the next one 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.609
 because they are very rare wings that do not 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.209
 can get in the game just like 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.760
 than all the other items and then it gives a 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.500
 flight proportion 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.840
 just like the two wins and the puc the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.030
 pum wings that are the ones that were added 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.010
 in the new version of good halloween 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.180
 I will fly first with this to show you 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.340
 and it has arrived more or less almost long 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.100
 now you can fly with this kind of 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.330
 galas that are very cool they look very 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.069
 good 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.800
 I would like you to add them to the game 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.900
 the truth 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.650
 and well this is nothing to show 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.300
 and I'll just say that it's rumored that maybe 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.940
 these wings have been added in 1.3 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.190
 is still missing as is the item that 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.700
 we will see now good I will place the wings 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.890
 again 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.900
 and the best of all they dress it because it is the 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.130
 from the middle east chest that is here and 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.980
 I will show you now which is the spei of 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.370
 pin machine gum this weapon is a 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.350
 high speed weapon has the same 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.370
 speed that the chain a that is a weapon 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.080
 new that has been introduced in 1.2 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.790
 with everyone in the update for more 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.760
 that is updated before Christmas and 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.860
 Well now I will show you the chain a 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.340
 that it would be the one that walks you 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.340
 European 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.069
 where you see yourself in the Christmas event 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.870
 of ash and can show how they see 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.080
 you do not have absolute control of this 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.080
 weapon is totally 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.889
 random to where it shoots and then now 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.539
 show the space dolphin machine gum 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.199
 as you can see the shots go 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.180
 perfectly rights to the address 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.580
 that point because they turn the shots and then 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.560
 that is the advantage that has 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.229
 and that's why it would be very good for them 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.940
 add now you can show him the bullet 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.910
 of Cristal 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.910
 good thing if you stop with these 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.910
 will be a lot of multiple damage already 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.950
 that the 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.160
 the pruning of glass that they release to the 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.470
 explode on impact as more will be done 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.410
 damage and now I will show you with the heat 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.190
 velocity widgets that will be made with 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.050
 Nuts that sell stamped a pool that 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.140
 would be the istanbul villager I do not know what is 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.750
 the translation into Spanish and well then 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.850
 how they see the shot or see when 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.640
 crashes which is something super fast 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.740
 ultra-fast there are no words for 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.940
 describe this or do not know if there will be a weapon 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.740
 faster than this and perfect and then in 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.340
 My opinion is that if they use the jet 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.360
 mid 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.960
 there is armor that would be the combination of 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:09.669
 Chlorine peter bar with bright fungus 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:13.389
 then they will have then consume much less 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:16.720
 bullets since it's guns has a 9 for 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:21.460
 Critical attack percent and 50% no 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.169
 consume 50% ammunition the truth that is 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.380
 a lot I would love them to add 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:29.790
 it's weapon, now I'm done with 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.790
 everything and save this where was 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.380
 and well, with this you have already finished 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.880
 everything there is nothing else to show and then 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.670
 I will warn before finishing this video that 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.860
 there will be a special 300 subscribers I already 

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:47.660
 I have 800 subscribers and I am very happy 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:51.180
 why and I will do a special since 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.689
 promised so much and I have not complied 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:58.699
 sorry for that 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:08:02.059
