00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 not only Croatian tourist destination with 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.140
 its beautiful coasts and landscapes 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.790
 suggestive no longer attracts only one 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.780
 sea-loving public of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.759
 holiday 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.139
 because in recent years he has seen it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.230
 development of a very phenomenon 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 particular dental tourism in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 croatia in fact a multitude arises 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 of studies specialized in dental care 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 but how reliable are these 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 facilities and what kind of services they offer 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 to find out we passed the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 Italian border with Slovenia and in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 about an hour reached rijeka one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.530
 location overlooking the sea because 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 many Italians reach Croatia 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 to carry out dental treatment 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 in my opinion and maybe because 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.610
 our staff here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.070
 our doctors are all rented 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.710
 special various specializations 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.309
 surgeons then specialists in the prosthesis 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 then another thing is the timing that we 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.760
 we are fast and maybe we are fast in the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 time and short type from the day 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.799
 of the extraction up to have the teeth 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 sometimes only a week goes by 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.030
 what timing is followed for 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.670
 carry out the various interventions 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 if one comes to get the capsules in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.619
 porcelain then the timing and he 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 today we start work immediately because 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.860
 he is not here and in two steps 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.780
 done km 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.159
 then we start work we do everything 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 what is needed because ours 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.930
 CC machines allow type 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.729
 devitalization of operations extractions 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.740
 surgical 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.799
 we take the fingerprints the patient returns 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.220
 at home and in a week he goes to institutions 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.009
 in porcelain, many patients do not believe 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.200
 this because they say but as he looks in 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 a week you make me teeth but us 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 with our guarantee issued and with 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.280
 the guarantee that many of them call us 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.530
 after twenty years they come here too 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.250
 greet us only for some check and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 they see 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.130
 and that even if one thing is fast it is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.020
 well done we have also our 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.320
 specialists for example because they come 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.000
 from us many cardiac patients or who 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.400
 they have various diseases 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.430
 then we must be sure that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.420
 we can proceed with these interventions 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.849
 we have 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.920
 cardiologist who comes here that everyone does 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.390
 the exams and then he tells us yes okay 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.140
 this patient can enter the room 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.060
 surgery 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.940
 we have seen a lot of intervention 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.900
 complex what timing you have 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 later we have seen today in the various 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 interventions video the example of the lord 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.270
 that he was completely foiled than not 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.160
 he didn't even have the bone to allow him 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.380
 facilities because if you don't house you can't 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.410
 crying in the hole lasted on 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.150
 patient came to us we have them 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.940
 extracted that 20 had a strong pardon 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.580
 then we did breast lift 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.700
 maxillary that would be sinus lift 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.799
 this hole we filled maxillary 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.819
 he knows artificial with his too know that 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:05.160
 we found it in his gums and then 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.730
 even with stem cells we did two 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.380
 blood samples and we have them 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.930
 attached this is a membrane made 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.519
 of his own body and then the patient between 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.430
 a couple of months came we have it 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.980
 made the slab 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.750
 we wanted to see how this is if it is 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.629
 all right we opened them to 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.540
 gingiva and another week from today 8 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.150
 days the patient will have as I say 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.819
 durbans smile will have 12 teeth in 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.819
 porcelain there is still a case that does not 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.549
 colleagues call it all on four solo o 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.129
 don't form we make it so that the 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.959
 patient to bodies fix the prosthesis there 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.659
 they are also simpler cases therefore 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.150
 inserting veneers where maybe 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.840
 there is a micro tooth rather than 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.480
 inserting a new tooth into 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.250
 In this case, the actions take place 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.470
 patients who are born without one 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.659
 tooth here for example in the case that 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.469
 we have seen without decisive instead 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.159
 the other from us is called micro dentalia 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:13.340
 than that the tooth really small 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:16.579
 then this patient led to 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.000
 a lot of orthodontics led him to 8 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.910
 years 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 because as it was small you could not 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.500
 put the plant because it is not there yet 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.900
 bone development 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.240
 then we waited for them there 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.639
 we put artificial or when 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.010
 we made the map of the hand e 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.380
 we saw that no longer grows this 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.270
 girl then means that she is gone 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.139
 danger that by putting a system there 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.560
 move to the bone 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.210
 we also put it artificial as one 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.610
 blood stem test tube because 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.690
 always good this membrane sticks 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.750
 better we put the system between two 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.260
 months the girl came here we have you 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.990
 open the gum we have 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.510
 put it as it's just a tooth 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.990
 because this case is of a girl who 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.590
 he knows his white teeth well then as a goal 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.360
 the ceramic below is metal and out 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.120
 we made them under ceramic 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.160
 zirconium this is done in these cases 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.560
 so that it is not seen at all 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.810
 our tooth difference is obvious 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.020
 of the patient on the other 20 we have 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.270
 made the facet in pure in pure 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.790
 porcelain which is called press facade 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.760
 in the studio we have seen the use of the 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.400
 laser to save a tooth without 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.790
 need for surgery 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.670
 yes this technology I say this 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:43.780
 in the future in stomatology and 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.600
 laser with laser can be done 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.190
 our staff at this specialization 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.510
 because certain interventions are made 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.600
 bloodless surgery without sutures 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.700
 in oral surgery 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.100
 when there is the pro with tosi you can 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.530
 prolong because they speak tosi this is 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.190
 then the gum disease can be 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.170
 always prolong then is this gums 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.080
 extend the life of the teeth there are 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.660
 also the authorizations that many have 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.560
 fear of the drill then this 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.980
 fillings should be followed that caries 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.889
 with laser it is destroyed and not needed 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.379
 to put 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.689
 anesthesia the lurano patient serves 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:31.289
 bucaro that this too is painful and not 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.590
 is used is also treat granulomas because 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.719
 granuloma is a process that is attacked 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.849
 instead of bacteria with laser yes 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.729
 they destroy these bacteria and they don't 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.639
 neither need structures nor sutures in the 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.520
 major surgeries in two three 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:50.039
 sessions will save this tooth the non-tooth 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.289
 need to extract it because they will kill you 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.860
 all pads and smiling saved without 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.810
 surgical interventions and if of tourism 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.150
 dental treats it is certain that the 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.610
 facility that we visited uses 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.460
 of experienced professionals capable of 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.039
 use advanced technologies that many 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.710
 cases help patients to avoid 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:13.550
 invasive surgical procedures 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.550
 ensuring a fast recovery
