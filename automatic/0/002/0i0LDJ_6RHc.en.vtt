of the cases during the raids we are not
constantly<00:00:36.210> devious<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.350> parts<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
constantly devious there are parts in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.580 
constantly devious there are parts in
what<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> dodge<00:00:38.840> we<00:00:39.840> need<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.200> pick<00:00:40.440> up

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
what we have to dodge we need to pick up

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.889 
what we have to dodge we need to pick up
a<00:00:40.649> fallen<00:00:41.100> friend<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.820> run<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.480> power

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
a fallen friend you run out of power

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.920 
a fallen friend you run out of power
every<00:00:43.800> time<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.190> stop<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.760> interrupt<00:00:45.719> our

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
every time we stop or interrupt our

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.540 
every time we stop or interrupt our
rotation<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
rotation and we are on the need of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
rotation and we are on the need of
starting<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.420> again<00:00:48.559> we<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> add<00:00:49.860> extra

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
starting it again we can add extra

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
starting it again we can add extra
damage<00:00:50.520> how<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.899> easy<00:00:52.110> before

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
damage how it's pretty easy before

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
damage how it's pretty easy before
starting<00:00:53.610> our<00:00:53.699> rotation<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
starting our rotation we are going to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
starting our rotation we are going to
top<00:00:54.989> range<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> before<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.460> come<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> top

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
top range and before we come to the top

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
top range and before we come to the top
range<00:00:57.329> animation<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.440> clip<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.890> fit<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> first

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
range animation we clip we fit the first

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
range animation we clip we fit the first
power<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.969> our<00:01:00.120> rotation<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.989> technique

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
power of our rotation this technique

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
power of our rotation this technique
works<00:01:01.710> wonders<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.370> branded<00:01:02.760> fights<00:01:03.030> it

no need to add an extra tab because to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
no need to add an extra tab because to
directly<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.850> from<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> mellitah<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.229> use

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
directly go from the mellitah so use

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.969 
directly go from the mellitah so use
this<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.369> rented<00:01:11.970> fights<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:13.229> dps<00:01:13.650> will

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this for rented fights and your dps will

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.570 
this for rented fights and your dps will
be<00:01:14.130> boosted<00:01:14.549> plateau<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> with

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
be boosted plateau so let's do it with

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.110 
be boosted plateau so let's do it with
that<00:01:17.790> range<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:18.930> power

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
that range then we do some power

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.970 
that range then we do some power
with<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.330> Prince<00:01:23.370> Yusupov<00:01:24.370> and<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:26.260> little<00:01:26.860> bit

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
with the Prince Yusupov and a little bit

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.090 
with the Prince Yusupov and a little bit
faster<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.350> brains<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:29.800> we'll<00:01:29.950> use<00:01:30.070> a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
faster with the brains and we'll use a

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.500 
faster with the brains and we'll use a
power<00:01:30.660> with<00:01:31.660> operate<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:32.350> use<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.530> power<00:01:32.800> as<00:01:33.510> you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
power with operate we use a power as you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.950 
power with operate we use a power as you
can<00:01:34.720> see<00:01:35.550> we<00:01:36.550> get<00:01:36.730> free<00:01:36.940> damage<00:01:37.150> there's<00:01:37.840> no

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
can see we get free damage there's no

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600 
can see we get free damage there's no
animation<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.620> top<00:01:38.950> range<00:01:39.220> there's<00:01:39.460> no

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
animation of the top range there's no

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.040 
animation of the top range there's no
animation<00:01:39.940> of<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.180> grenade<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:40.930> are

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
animation of the grenade and we are

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.410 
animation of the grenade and we are
getting<00:01:41.260> three<00:01:41.530> damage<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.310> every<00:01:42.670> time<00:01:42.700> we

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
getting three damage so every time we

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.840 
getting three damage so every time we
need<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.660> start<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.110> rotation<00:01:44.620> adding<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:45.580> top

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
need to start a rotation adding this top

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.510 
need to start a rotation adding this top
range<00:01:46.120> is<00:01:46.330> going<00:01:46.540> to<00:01:46.660> increase<00:01:46.900> our<00:01:47.080> DBS<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
range is going to increase our DBS the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.420 
range is going to increase our DBS the
weapon<00:01:48.880> damage<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.420> free<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:50.530> doesn't<00:01:50.740> consume

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
weapon damage is free it doesn't consume

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.270 
weapon damage is free it doesn't consume
any<00:01:51.760> power<00:01:52.120> so<00:01:52.600> classically<00:01:53.259> by<00:01:53.800> doing<00:01:54.070> this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
any power so classically by doing this

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.550 
any power so classically by doing this
we<00:01:54.910> are<00:01:54.940> added<00:01:55.420> freedom<00:01:55.869> it's<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.290> our<00:01:56.350> gps

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
we are added freedom it's to our gps

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.700 
we are added freedom it's to our gps
without<00:01:57.130> any<00:01:57.340> especially<00:01:57.940> if<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.259> may<00:01:59.470> not<00:01:59.650> be

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
without any especially if it may not be

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.070 
without any especially if it may not be
much<00:02:00.009> but<00:02:00.340> imagine<00:02:01.210> every<00:02:01.540> time<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.930> need<00:02:02.050> to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
much but imagine every time you need to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.170 
much but imagine every time you need to
be<00:02:02.259> start<00:02:02.619> with<00:02:02.800> your<00:02:03.040> rotation<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.850> do<00:02:04.030> this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
be start with your rotation you do this
