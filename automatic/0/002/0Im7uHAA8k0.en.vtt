00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.560
 Hello, we are completing the seventh mission 4 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.020
 episode mode 2 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.020
 we fall on such a dam 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.789
 beautiful big huge big 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.649
 quantity can 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:42.370
 so far only 2 players have knocked us out 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:42.370
 Probably not enough monsters well, they will be more 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.620
 the task is to hold out for 5 minutes 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:03.399
 you can resurrect living water 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.399
 climbs upstairs home can mean 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.720
 to see all this beauty from above 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.720
 i stuck there 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280
 monsters 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 I'm only while below 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.110
 not climbing up very interesting what 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.210
 there but i need 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.880
 catch as much as possible 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.390
 earn frags to get three 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.290
 missions 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.290
 with an asterisk 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.060
 only 2 minutes left 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.129
 suicide 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.540
 like 38 seconds I want to stop because 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.150
 that most likely it is not murder 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.360
 monsters then the mission will not be against 3 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.360
 stars 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.640
 so I risk my life and their life 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.640
 shooting from the bazooka 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:55.719
 single-shot we are more interesting in time 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.719
 overcharge 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.360
 four seconds there are still 100 frags there 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.740
 in the last seconds I did to everyone 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.740
 thanks for watching everyone bye
