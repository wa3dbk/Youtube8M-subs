00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.120

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.769
 to show 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.040
 First choose the color that we 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.229
 we will tint I chose this one 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.620
 emerald 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:05.810
 neighboring 2 fine i tidy aside 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:09.560
 only one now remains 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.320
 wet for this i dunk just flour in 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 a cup of water and a good spin and 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.140
 now what are we doing 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.890
 sponge fold like that in half and 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.960
 fasten with clothespin 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.940
 I use vodka several times 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.010
 so she is already so painted 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.400
 after work i just help sponge 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:36.020
 but washed away and everything and you can use it 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.700
 re- put on a piece of paper our 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.350
 petal 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.860
 we will need a piece of paper too 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.420
 brush off the excess of our paint now 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.980
 what are we doing here this prepared 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 brush that we got from 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:58.280
 foam rubber and clothespins 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:59.000
 we rub our color like this 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.720
 we have here 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.990
 reflected launchers from we rubbed a sponge 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.190
 put paint look excess paint 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.250
 can be smacked like this to pieces of paper 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.980
 if we see that too dry with us 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.099
 turned paint we literally dunk 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.640
 finger in the paint and here on the sponge 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.640
 we put 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.880
 and when we make a couple of moscow 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.380
 look there is our sponge enough in 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.110
 paint surplus we waved several times 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.710
 on paper that we had a sponge 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.730
 dry and begin to apply 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.350
 hold the leaf our petal and with 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.020
 edge neatly with such movements 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.910
 we tint our petal goblet put not 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.910
 tilted and almost exactly 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.680
 the edge above must be carried in paint on 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.990
 Foamiran from the other side of the mask do 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.960
 little short intermittent then 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.970
 there is something dry pastels 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.110
 Generally the paint on the Pamirs reminds me 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.890
 applying eye shadow 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.520
 that is, for centuries, our ribs, too, too 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:30.390
 It is convenient to tint with such a brush from 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:33.120
 foam at the same time we have not fingers 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.150
 the napkin is smeared off 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.980
 used with wet so can 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.630
 train on the other hand exactly 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.820
 also 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.010
 the paint holds on the lips for a long time 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.110
 remind the paint should be visible sponge 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.950
 should be semi-dry because if u 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.050
 you sponge will be very wet then the mask 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.430
 you will turn ugly will not 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.430
 toning and just daub 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.800
 better several times in one place 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.040
 apply a dry sponge with paint 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.570
 than you take this very wet right away 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.570
 and you will just daub 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.920
 Here we have a leaf like this 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.970
 to we painted over while we painted over too 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.770
 This is the way I wanted to show you 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.200
 I remind that we fold their navel 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.280
 in half a sponge of arbitrary length such 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.590
 which one is convenient for you to use and there our 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.710
 master class is over all you good
