00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.020
 This time to demonstrate the puff batter 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.240
 With a layer of pineapple skin 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.260
 Is a pineapple puff 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.980
 It’s easy to bake round and beautiful 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 Taste crisp and delicious 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.360
 First make pineapple skin because it has to be frozen for a while. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.880
 The pineapple skin is as simple as making a pastry. 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.220
 Add flour 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.520
 Add sugar 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.900
 Stir with cream 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.960
 Stir by hand 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.300
 The cream has been taken out of the refrigerator for 1 hour. 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.940
 Placed between two baking papers 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.720
 Then squash to 2 mm thick 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.180
 Is it thin enough? 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.960
 Very thin 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.580
 Put it in the freezer 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.820
 To make a puff batter 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.680
 milk 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.060
 Put half of the water and half of the milk 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 add sugar 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.220
 Put salt 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.960
 Small piece of cream 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.580
 Heat together 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 After the big roll, see if the cream is completely melted. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.740
 Add flour after leaving the fire 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 Squeeze with a spatula 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.720
 Heating to dilute the water, then add the egg to stir 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.900
 Into a group and not finished 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420
 Add eggs to stir away from the fire 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.920
 Avoid protein cooking 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.820
 Puff batter is still very hot 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.020
 Slowly add eggs 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.860
 You can use a scraper to divide the dough into small balls. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.060
 Put the egg in again 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.200
 After mixing evenly, continue adding eggs. 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.400
 In order to add the right amount of egg liquid, first break the last egg. 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.320
 Add half first 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.280
 Slowly add 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.120
 The most difficult part is now 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.660
 Pay great attention to consistency 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.520
 Too thick and too thin will not work 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.880
 Pick up the scraper vertically 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.140
 The puff batter will drop at the end and be pointed 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.080
 Now I need to fill the puff batter into the squeeze bag. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.340
 What we have to do is a small puff 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.780
 There is also a small puff of pearl sugar 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.540
 Use a flat mouth to squeeze the puff batter 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.820
 Squeeze the appropriate amount and lift it up 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.340
 Now cut the pineapple skin and lay them on the puffs. 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.840
 Pineapple skin has been frozen 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.900
 Cut into small pieces 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.300
 Move fast 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.620
 Otherwise it will be soft 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.200
 Bake at 160 ° C for more than 20 minutes 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.320
 Note that the appearance of the puff looks good, but the center must be baked to dry. 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.800
 It takes 25 minutes to bake. 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.800
 They look very good 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.340
 Looks very dry 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.860
 But after adding soft filling, the inner layer of the puff will become soft. 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.920
 Thank you 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.040
 See you next time
