out<00:00:12.280> of<00:00:12.700> scales<00:00:13.269> this<00:00:14.079> is<00:00:14.259> a<00:00:14.289> fun<00:00:14.650> process<00:00:15.339> and

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
out of scales this is a fun process and

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.270 
out of scales this is a fun process and
it's<00:00:16.209> very<00:00:16.360> open-ended<00:00:17.170> so<00:00:17.800> if<00:00:17.920> you<00:00:18.010> know<00:00:18.160> the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
it's very open-ended so if you know the

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's very open-ended so if you know the
basics<00:00:18.760> then<00:00:19.210> you<00:00:19.360> can<00:00:19.540> start<00:00:19.810> creating<00:00:20.020> your

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
basics then you can start creating your

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.440 
basics then you can start creating your
own<00:00:20.560> melodies<00:00:21.040> just<00:00:21.520> based<00:00:21.760> on<00:00:21.940> a<00:00:22.210> simple

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
I'm considering my active pitches and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.340 
I'm considering my active pitches and
moving<00:01:31.940> them<00:01:32.060> towards<00:01:32.390> resting<00:01:32.810> pitches<00:01:33.170> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
pitches to find new active ones you can

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.580 
pitches to find new active ones you can
experiment<00:01:38.030> with<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:38.510> indefinitely<00:01:39.229> and

experiment with this indefinitely and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
then begin to add in pitches that don't
