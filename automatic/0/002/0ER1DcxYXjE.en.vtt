means a couple seconds at the beginning

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.270 
means a couple seconds at the beginning
really<00:00:10.349> make<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> difference<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:10.920> actually<00:00:11.219> we

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280

teach you how to get the best start so

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.930 
teach you how to get the best start so
that<00:00:13.170> you're<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.380> best<00:00:13.530> place<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.759> race

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
that you're in the best place in a race

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.390 
that you're in the best place in a race
at<00:00:15.540> all<00:00:15.630> times<00:00:15.929> typical<00:00:16.560> Beach<00:00:16.830> start<00:00:17.250> is

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
at all times typical Beach start is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.340 
at all times typical Beach start is
actually<00:00:17.550> when<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> people<00:00:18.810> line<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.020> on

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
actually when all the people line up on

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.970 
actually when all the people line up on
one<00:00:19.560> long<00:00:20.270> start<00:00:21.270> line<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:22.529> face<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
one long start line and then face the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.730 
one long start line and then face the
first<00:00:23.340> buoy<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.970> at<00:00:24.420> some<00:00:24.570> point<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.619> know

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
first buoy and at some point you know

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.650 
first buoy and at some point you know
somebody<00:00:26.160> shoots<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> again<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.449> run

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
somebody shoots it again and we all run

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
somebody shoots it again and we all run
in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> water<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.010> about<00:00:29.099> also

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
in the water and then it's about also

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.919 
in the water and then it's about also
positioning<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.269> you're<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
positioning if you're going to be on the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.030 
positioning if you're going to be on the
left<00:00:31.109> side<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.470> you're<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
left side if you're going to be in the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
left side if you're going to be in the
middle<00:00:32.309> everybody<00:00:33.059> usually<00:00:33.329> picks<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
middle everybody usually picks the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
middle everybody usually picks the
straight<00:00:34.649> line<00:00:34.860> through<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> first<00:00:35.370> week

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
straight line through the first week

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940 
straight line through the first week
because<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> shortest<00:00:36.270> line<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.620> every

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
because it's the shortest line but every

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.680 
because it's the shortest line but every
good<00:00:38.100> swimmer<00:00:38.370> does<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.390> happen

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
good swimmer does it so what will happen

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
good swimmer does it so what will happen
you<00:00:40.140> swim<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> don't

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you swim like this you know you don't

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.979 
you swim like this you know you don't
have<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:41.969> space<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.480> run<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
have much space if you run with all the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.479 
have much space if you run with all the
guys<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> water<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> much

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
guys into the water you have that much

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.840 
guys into the water you have that much
space<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> swim<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.250> use<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.489> more

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
space and if you swim I use way more

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
space and if you swim I use way more
space<00:00:48.360> than<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> have

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
space than this little bit that I have

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.830 
space than this little bit that I have
so<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> turns<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
so it turns out to be a little bit of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
so it turns out to be a little bit of
elbow<00:00:51.989> fight<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.520> very

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
elbow fight to get in so it's very

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
elbow fight to get in so it's very
important<00:00:54.059> where<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.449> position<00:00:54.629> yourself<00:00:55.020> on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
important where you position yourself on

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
important where you position yourself on
the<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.949> line<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.699> people<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.360> far

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the start line some people go on the far

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
the start line some people go on the far
left<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.079> might<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.680> longer<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
left it might be a little longer but you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
left it might be a little longer but you
actually<00:00:59.789> have<00:01:00.000> clear<00:01:00.239> water<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.780> swim<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.500> he

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
actually have clear water to swim if he

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
actually have clear water to swim if he
drops<00:01:01.920> quick<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.609> run<00:01:02.820> into<00:01:03.000> water<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
drops quick you run into water and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
drops quick you run into water and
suddenly<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> no<00:01:04.650> grip<00:01:04.890> anymore

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
suddenly well you have no grip anymore

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
suddenly well you have no grip anymore
so<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> swim<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.090> away<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.930> are

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so you get a swim right away there are

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.929 
so you get a swim right away there are
other<00:01:07.110> races<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.680> remember<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.280> Mexico<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> was

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
other races I remember in Mexico I was

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
other races I remember in Mexico I was
running<00:01:09.360> over<00:01:09.510> 200<00:01:10.290> meters<00:01:10.409> into<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> water

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
running over 200 meters into the water

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
running over 200 meters into the water
and<00:01:11.610> well<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> water<00:01:12.659> goes<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> here

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and well if the water goes up to here

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
and well if the water goes up to here
you<00:01:13.740> still<00:01:13.979> can't<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:15.030> normal<00:01:15.150> stride

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you still can't use your normal stride

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
you still can't use your normal stride
you're<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.710> know<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.159> feet<00:01:17.430> will

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you're just not you know your feet will

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
you're just not you know your feet will
touch<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> water<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> whole<00:01:18.570> time<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.990> run

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
touch the water the whole time if I run

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
touch the water the whole time if I run
like<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> outside<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.939> actually

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
like this and the outside I can actually

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
like this and the outside I can actually
run<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.540> further<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.350> looks<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> funny

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
run way further it looks kind of funny

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.080 
run way further it looks kind of funny
if<00:01:23.159> you're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> back

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
if you're going to look from the back

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
if you're going to look from the back
I'm<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.420> running<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> water<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.290> but

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
I'm not running in the water now but

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.289 
I'm not running in the water now but
I'll<00:01:25.830> show<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.549> run<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
I'll show you you can run like this and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.499 
I'll show you you can run like this and
then<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> start<00:01:28.170> running<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.299> about

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
then you start running you think about

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.940 
then you start running you think about
the<00:01:30.630> other<00:01:30.750> person<00:01:30.990> obviously<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.590> hit<00:01:31.799> me

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the other person obviously gonna hit me

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
the other person obviously gonna hit me
again<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.759> try<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
again or this and that try to be in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
again or this and that try to be in
clear<00:01:34.049> water<00:01:34.229> sometimes<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.860> better<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
clear water sometimes it's better to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
clear water sometimes it's better to
swim<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> couple<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.909> meters<00:01:36.180> longer<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.869> stay

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
swim a couple of meters longer and stay

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.990 
swim a couple of meters longer and stay
on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> outside<00:01:37.799> versus<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.700> straight

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
on the outside versus on the straight

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.350 
on the outside versus on the straight
line<00:01:39.030> where<00:01:39.390> everyone<00:01:39.720> wants

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
line where everyone wants

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.800 
line where everyone wants
it's<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.520> got<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.730> try<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:42.940> out<00:01:43.090> most<00:01:43.570> ways

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
it's a you got to try it out most ways

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.690 
it's a you got to try it out most ways
and<00:01:44.110> figure<00:01:44.440> out<00:01:44.500> what's<00:01:44.740> best<00:01:44.770> for<00:01:44.980> you<00:01:45.220> we

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
and figure out what's best for you we

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.370 
and figure out what's best for you we
don't<00:01:45.880> see<00:01:46.150> much<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.690> void<00:01:46.900> because<00:01:47.170> you

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
don't see much of the void because you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.750 
don't see much of the void because you
have<00:01:47.470> people<00:01:47.650> in<00:01:47.830> front<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.340> splashing

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
have people in front of you splashing

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.790 
have people in front of you splashing
water<00:01:49.120> so<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.510> don't<00:01:49.690> see<00:01:49.900> much<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.530> what<00:01:50.680> I<00:01:50.710> do

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
water so you don't see much so what I do

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.490 
water so you don't see much so what I do
I<00:01:50.920> look<00:01:51.160> at<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.460> buoy<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.480> I<00:01:52.570> see<00:01:52.840> very<00:01:52.870> tall

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
I look at the buoy and I see very tall

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.140 
I look at the buoy and I see very tall
building<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.280> right<00:01:54.430> side<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:55.030> see

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
building on the right side we see

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.520 
building on the right side we see
there's<00:01:55.330> three<00:01:55.660> in<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.870> middle<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.290> in<00:01:56.350> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
there's three in the middle right in the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.700 
there's three in the middle right in the
line<00:01:57.510> alright<00:01:58.510> so<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:58.990> want<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.230> aim<00:01:59.380> at<00:01:59.560> those

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
line alright so I want to aim at those

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.170 
line alright so I want to aim at those
three<00:02:00.040> buildings<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.580> are<00:02:00.700> actually<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.090> a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
three buildings that are actually in a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.060 
three buildings that are actually in a
straight<00:02:01.510> shot<00:02:01.780> if<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.200> wanted<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.500> check<00:02:02.800> how

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
straight shot if we wanted to check how

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.560 
straight shot if we wanted to check how
deep<00:02:03.100> with<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.580> water<00:02:03.760> actually<00:02:04.090> by<00:02:04.180> walking

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
deep with the water actually by walking

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.540 
deep with the water actually by walking
in<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.140> we<00:02:05.260> know<00:02:05.440> if<00:02:05.710> we<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.220> run<00:02:06.340> like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
in so we know if we have to run like

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.359 
in so we know if we have to run like
this<00:02:06.790> or<00:02:07.180> if<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.570> if<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.810> drops<00:02:08.080> pretty<00:02:08.410> deep<00:02:08.560> we

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
this or if it if it drops pretty deep we

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.980 
this or if it if it drops pretty deep we
actually<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.790> see<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> lot<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.300> stones<00:02:10.600> here

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
actually do see a lot of stones here

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.960 
actually do see a lot of stones here
yeah<00:02:11.200> very<00:02:11.890> quick<00:02:12.190> there<00:02:12.340> will<00:02:12.460> be<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.610> couple

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
yeah very quick there will be a couple

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.060 
yeah very quick there will be a couple
of<00:02:13.000> steps<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.420> water<00:02:13.660> one<00:02:14.560> jump<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:21.040> I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
of steps in the water one jump what I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.340 
of steps in the water one jump what I
always<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.700> listen<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.750> starter<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
because you can't say in this position

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.660 
because you can't say in this position
too<00:02:29.320> long<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.650> all<00:02:29.770> know<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.250> sculling

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
too long we all know that the sculling

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.699 
too long we all know that the sculling
will<00:02:30.820> be<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.090> know<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.480> practicing<00:02:32.020> takes

will be do you know the practicing takes

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.860 
will be do you know the practicing takes
a<00:02:32.800> lot<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:32.950> energy<00:02:33.340> actually<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.600> always

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
a lot of energy actually so I always

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.330 
a lot of energy actually so I always
stay<00:02:35.110> like<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.680> observe<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.220> other

Dierks going to show you how to draft

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.140 
Dierks going to show you how to draft
the<00:03:24.060> air<00:03:24.239> wants<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.989> come<00:03:25.140> up<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.830> if<00:03:26.430> he<00:03:26.940> gets

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the air wants to come up so if he gets

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.030 
the air wants to come up so if he gets
all<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> bubbles<00:03:27.810> under<00:03:28.049> his<00:03:28.200> body<00:03:28.440> his<00:03:29.010> body

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
all the bubbles under his body his body

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.220 
all the bubbles under his body his body
actually<00:03:29.489> floats<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.269> little<00:03:30.510> bit<00:03:30.659> during<00:03:31.080> this

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
actually floats a little bit during this

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.199 
actually floats a little bit during this
time<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.769> literally<00:03:32.040> right<00:03:32.610> up<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.909> his<00:03:33.000> side

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
time is literally right up on his side

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.720 
time is literally right up on his side
the<00:03:33.599> reason<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.379> is<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:35.549> when<00:03:35.670> you

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
the reason for this is you know when you

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.860 
the reason for this is you know when you
swim<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.120> create<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.450> weight

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
swim you create the weight

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930 
swim you create the weight
Dierks<00:03:37.440> like<00:03:37.680> right<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.489> belly<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
Dierks like right in the belly of the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.940 
Dierks like right in the belly of the
wake<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.569> he's<00:03:39.720> getting<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.170> biggest<00:03:40.470> benefit

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
wake so he's getting the biggest benefit

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.100 
wake so he's getting the biggest benefit
the<00:03:41.190> most<00:03:41.400> left<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.329> least<00:03:42.540> resistance

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
the most left the least resistance

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.600 
the most left the least resistance
because<00:03:43.409> you've<00:03:43.560> broken<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:44.040> tension<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
because you've broken the tension in the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.240 
because you've broken the tension in the
water<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.120> him<00:03:45.329> flip<00:03:45.810> over<00:03:46.140> onto<00:03:46.739> his<00:03:47.040> back

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
one stroke then roll over and off he

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.369 
one stroke then roll over and off he
goes<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:54.510> he's<00:03:54.629> going<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.780> shorten<00:03:55.079> his<00:03:55.170> arm

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
goes so he's going to shorten his arm
