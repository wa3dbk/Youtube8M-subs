00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
here and you can take a quick look at

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
here and you can take a quick look at
what<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> inside<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.820> fairly

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
what the inside is like it's fairly

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.319 
what the inside is like it's fairly
uneventful<00:01:51.979> inside<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:54.000> real

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
uneventful inside here no real

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.880 
uneventful inside here no real
additional<00:01:54.840> padding<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.470> anything<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.829> that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
additional padding or anything like that

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.510 
additional padding or anything like that
but<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:57.360> provides<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.290> great<00:01:58.979> baseline

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
but it provides a really great baseline

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
but it provides a really great baseline
level<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> protection<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.530> it's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
level of protection and I think it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.440 
level of protection and I think it's
currently<00:02:02.219> retailing<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:03.000> 35<00:02:03.420> bucks

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
currently retailing for about 35 bucks

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.020 
currently retailing for about 35 bucks
so<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.159> official<00:02:05.490> branding<00:02:05.909> there

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and actually one of the more subtle

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.520 
and actually one of the more subtle
things<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.840> appreciated<00:02:13.290> about

this
that<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.950> seam<00:02:15.660> between<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.990> soft<00:02:17.950> portion

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
that the seam between the soft portion

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.500 
that the seam between the soft portion
here<00:02:18.490> in<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.640> hard<00:02:18.850> portion<00:02:19.240> underneath

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
here in the hard portion underneath

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.840 
here in the hard portion underneath
lines<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.350> perfectly<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:20.890> what's<00:02:21.430> going<00:02:21.700> on

with<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> device<00:02:22.690> underneath<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.440> you'll<00:02:23.620> see

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
with the device underneath so you'll see

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.309

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
of the device so from a distance I find

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.729 
of the device so from a distance I find
that<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.610> makes<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.560> you've<00:02:35.560> almost

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
that that makes it so that you've almost

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.490 
that that makes it so that you've almost
not<00:02:36.040> really<00:02:36.370> tell<00:02:36.850> where<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> case<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
not really tell where the case and the

not really tell where the case and the
phone<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.130> then<00:02:39.280> start<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.910> they're<00:02:40.480> very

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
