00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 pretty the materials that we're going to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.940
 need for this craft are a 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.769
 sheath of an instrument and markers 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.070
 acrylics others to you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.070
 imagination 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.400
 first of all we will need 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:25.150
 practice the letters we want to put 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.150
 in the sleeve so girls to practice 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.130
 once we have decided the letters 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.160
 of the songs that they like the most 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.470
 our boyfriend or whatever we want to put 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.510
 it's time to pick up a pencil 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.170
 makeup as I did in this case 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.400
 white to mark where they are going 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 exactly the letters that we want 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.850
 put it 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.680
 it occurred to me to ask people of my 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.080
 family like my brother my father my 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.110
 mother to make me some letters 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.920
 so that it will be differently 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.020
 and not all the letters were the same if 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 you us well make lyrics 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 different as you can try it 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.409
 if you put the letters in different 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 senses will be much cooler besides 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.060
 you can create different designs as 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.189
 you like everything is a matter of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.789
 imagination and to put a little bit of 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.789
 sweetie 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.909
 once we have everything marked 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.210
 where we want it to go is exactly 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.490
 the time to pick up the markers 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.890
 Acrylics that I found in a 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.929
 craft shop and get to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.349
 draw on top of what we already had 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.110
 put and already each the colors that you 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.360
 Like I chose the white because it stands out 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.739
 more in the black case and the green one that is 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.739
 my boyfriend's favorite color 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.470
 it also occurred to me to add some 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.720
 little drawings related to groups of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.450
 music that you like in this case this 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.940
 doll is related to pearl jam 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.940
 in his song like 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.540
 and finally I added some 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.880
 touches in orange to highlight 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.130
 some little things I also put the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.230
 zippers some dolls and one 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.720

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.300
