00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
I have open I have pretty much set up

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.589 
I have open I have pretty much set up
just<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.040> basics<00:03:20.579> right<00:03:20.819> now<00:03:21.030> I've<00:03:21.449> been

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
just the basics right now I've been

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.390 
just the basics right now I've been
using<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.109> though<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.470> feels<00:03:22.620> great<00:03:23.129> in<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
using it though it feels great in the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.030 
using it though it feels great in the
hand<00:03:23.519> now<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.569> like<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.870> idea<00:03:25.199> that<00:03:25.319> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
hand now I just like the idea that the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.869 
hand now I just like the idea that the
mouse<00:03:26.280> has<00:03:27.269> gotten<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> point<00:03:28.169> where<00:03:28.319> it's

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
mouse has gotten to the point where it's

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.439 
mouse has gotten to the point where it's
so<00:03:29.879> I<00:03:30.650> don't<00:03:31.650> know<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:32.790> great<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.090> you

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
so I don't know it's just great that you

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.659 
so I don't know it's just great that you
can<00:03:33.629> now<00:03:33.780> program<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> mouse<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:35.129> do<00:03:35.280> exactly

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
can now program a mouse to do exactly

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.180 
can now program a mouse to do exactly
what<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.090> want<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.650> more<00:03:37.889> you<00:03:37.919> get<00:03:38.129> used
