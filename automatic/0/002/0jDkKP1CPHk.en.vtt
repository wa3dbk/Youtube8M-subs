 Hello dear friends with you poppy I 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 I also welcome comic lovers 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.930
 Today we have a review 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.680
 comic batman quiet happiness brought on 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 Russian language 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.830
 the thickness of the comic is rather big mean on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 I think comics made these very 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.800
 critical paints in such here where 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 inherent in the style of depression well, Batman 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.410
 he has a story I really 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.790
 very very sad 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.739
 what I want to say about this 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.930
 comic strip 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.450
 the comic is awesome and translated 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.640
 great and the plot is just wonderful 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 figured here 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 almost all of the main villains of Batman 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.510
 but it 's not about how they figure 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 appear and the fact is this is this 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.390
 cone 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.829
 real detective meaning i'm to the last 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.670
 page did not know who was behind whom and what 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:33.469
 what is it worth but i want to tell you yes you are 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.270
 by the way small spoilers in 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:40.799
 presence of superman in this comic 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.369
 as we all know batman is the only one 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.390
 superhero who may not give people 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.390
 dude in red shorts 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.750
 I advise you to read this comic because 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.750
 which to be honest is not able to break away and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.390
 wonderful here's how you see a riot 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.390
 paint present 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.740
 that's scary playing dude in a mask so 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.830
 call will be the main instigator of everything and 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.420
 Bruce Wayne's subsequent troubles 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.650
 late by the way here are some such art 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.650
 go and sketches 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.860
 Well, at the very end are described 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.190
 characters some clarification is given 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.830
 who is who and in what series and parts 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.990
 batman attended or dragged first 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.890
 appearance on it all this was such
