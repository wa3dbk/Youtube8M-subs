00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
try to replicate the method used to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.530 
try to replicate the method used to
unbox<00:02:32.900> by<00:02:33.650> famous<00:02:34.300> unboxers

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
unbox by famous unboxers

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:49.000 
unbox by famous unboxers
so<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.200> goes<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.380> little<00:02:36.560> bit<00:02:36.740> like<00:02:36.890> this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.120 

today<00:02:50.570> yes<00:02:51.570> into<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.230> something<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.800> that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
today yes into it something like that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.760 
today yes into it something like that
more<00:02:53.820> or<00:02:53.910> less<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.930> package<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.440> nearly

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
more or less like the package is nearly

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.560 
more or less like the package is nearly
open<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:56.610> there's<00:02:56.820> something<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.300> gotta<00:02:57.510> show

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.480 

anyway<00:04:34.880> yeah<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:35.870> always<00:04:36.380> liked<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.190> have

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
anyway yeah I always liked to have

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.700 
anyway yeah I always liked to have
instruction<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.270> animals<00:04:38.570> even<00:04:38.870> if<00:04:39.110> it's<00:04:39.440> all

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
instruction and animals even if it's all

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.970 
instruction and animals even if it's all
this<00:04:40.030> crap<00:04:41.030> because<00:04:41.270> if<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.380> weren't<00:04:42.650> for<00:04:42.680> this

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
this crap because if it weren't for this

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.730 
this crap because if it weren't for this
I<00:04:43.480> probably<00:04:44.480> would<00:04:44.750> be<00:04:44.870> thinking<00:04:45.200> by<00:04:45.350> now<00:04:45.500> this

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
I probably would be thinking by now this

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.370 
I probably would be thinking by now this
these<00:04:46.580> things<00:04:47.090> will<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:47.420> stickers<00:04:47.810> which<00:04:48.170> they

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
these things will be stickers which they

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.090 
these things will be stickers which they
are<00:04:48.500> not
