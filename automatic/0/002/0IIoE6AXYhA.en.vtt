00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.240 

makes<00:00:17.570> it<00:00:17.720> easier

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:29.640 

yeah

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.380 

okay<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:30.710> we're<00:00:31.070> now<00:00:31.160> gonna<00:00:31.340> try<00:00:31.670> it<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:32.059> see<00:00:32.300> if

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
okay so we're now gonna try it to see if

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.670 
okay so we're now gonna try it to see if
I<00:00:32.480> can<00:00:32.629> get<00:00:32.750> something<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.200> work<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.649> I

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
I can get something to work that I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.600 
I can get something to work that I
haven't<00:00:33.890> done<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.309> I<00:00:34.399> longed<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:37.250> for

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
haven't done it I longed this is for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.619 
haven't done it I longed this is for
spreading<00:00:38.770> glue<00:00:39.770> over<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.610> put<00:00:41.030> condoms<00:00:41.480> on

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
spreading glue over to put condoms on

00:00:41.629 --> 00:01:33.940 
spreading glue over to put condoms on
the<00:00:41.780> tiles<00:00:43.030> it's<00:00:44.030> half<00:00:44.239> a<00:00:44.390> one<00:00:44.570> actually

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.900 

and<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> bottom<00:01:35.400> layers<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.180> easiest<00:01:37.910> no

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
and the bottom layers are the easiest no

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.550 
and the bottom layers are the easiest no
see<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.660> that's<00:01:39.810> useful<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
see the thing that's useful about this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.760 
see the thing that's useful about this
tool<00:01:40.800> is

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.219 

is<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.369> once<00:01:45.579> I<00:01:45.729> get<00:01:45.880> started

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:02:21.199 

exactly

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.179 

you<00:02:21.450> think<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.170> full-size<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.950> could

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
you think that the full-size that could

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.240 
you think that the full-size that could
be<00:02:23.400> easy<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.390> someone<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> hop

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
be easy and someone that's just the hop

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.630 
be easy and someone that's just the hop
over<00:02:26.549> there<00:02:28.519> no<00:02:29.519> because<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.030> doesn't<00:02:30.060> Bend<00:02:31.640> so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
over there no because it doesn't Bend so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.130 
over there no because it doesn't Bend so
it<00:02:33.060> doesn't<00:02:34.939> it<00:02:35.939> doesn't<00:02:36.150> fit<00:02:36.629> around<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it doesn't it doesn't fit around the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
it doesn't it doesn't fit around the
piece<00:02:37.379> yeah<00:02:39.739> that's<00:02:40.739> if<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.400> had<00:02:41.549> something

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
piece yeah that's if you had something

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.280 
piece yeah that's if you had something
to<00:02:41.909> fit<00:02:42.180> around<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.540> piece<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.019> would<00:02:43.109> be

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
to fit around the piece that would be

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.380 
to fit around the piece that would be
easier

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.050 

I<00:02:49.420> mean<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.080> would<00:02:50.200> be<00:02:50.350> easier<00:02:50.740> in<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.640> sense<00:02:51.910> if

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
I mean it would be easier in a sense if

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.970 
I mean it would be easier in a sense if
I<00:02:52.180> was<00:02:52.330> using<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.780> smaller<00:02:53.110> ones<00:02:53.440> because<00:02:53.680> I'd

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I was using the smaller ones because I'd

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.620 
I was using the smaller ones because I'd
be<00:02:54.130> able<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.370> get<00:02:54.520> more<00:02:55.740> cuts<00:02:56.740> per<00:03:00.090> yeah<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.120> see

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
be able to get more cuts per yeah I see

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.410 
be able to get more cuts per yeah I see
it's<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:03.280> ain't<00:03:03.520> gonna<00:03:03.670> survive<00:03:05.970> yeah<00:03:06.970> it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
it's this ain't gonna survive yeah it's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.130 
it's this ain't gonna survive yeah it's
yeah<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.810> gotta<00:03:08.050> bend<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.100> even

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
yeah it's gotta bend is that even

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.600 
yeah it's gotta bend is that even
wetness

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
wetness

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.000 
wetness
no<00:03:15.610> there's<00:03:16.150> some<00:03:16.480> where<00:03:16.690> I've<00:03:17.290> got<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> thin

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
no there's some where I've got a thin

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:40.560 
no there's some where I've got a thin
spot<00:03:37.890> when<00:03:38.890> they<00:03:39.010> get<00:03:39.280> flutter<00:03:39.760> seems<00:03:40.270> like<00:03:40.540> a

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
spot when they get flutter seems like a

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.940 
spot when they get flutter seems like a
higher<00:03:40.900> than<00:03:41.350> mad<00:03:41.820> Vertica

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.089 

this<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.520> Harder's<00:03:49.230> because<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:50.530> not<00:03:50.770> you

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
this is Harder's because it's not you

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.150 
this is Harder's because it's not you
know<00:03:51.280> it's<00:03:51.430> not<00:03:51.780> particularly<00:03:52.780> easy<00:03:53.160> button

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
know it's not particularly easy button

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.309 
know it's not particularly easy button
process<00:03:54.670> but<00:03:54.940> this<00:03:55.300> is<00:03:55.510> you're<00:03:55.810> not<00:03:55.959> supposed

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
process but this is you're not supposed

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.490 
process but this is you're not supposed
to<00:03:56.410> press<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.459> my<00:03:57.670> genuine<00:03:58.090> yet<00:03:58.420> are<00:03:59.349> you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
to press it to my genuine yet are you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.240 
to press it to my genuine yet are you
present<00:04:00.130> yeah<00:04:04.470> yeah<00:04:05.470> because<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:06.069> is

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
present yeah yeah because this is

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.050 
present yeah yeah because this is
trimming<00:04:06.640> as<00:04:07.000> opposed<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:10.080> making<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.350> mark<00:04:12.060> but

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
trimming as opposed to making a mark but

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.430 
trimming as opposed to making a mark but
note<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.480> know<00:04:13.569> making<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.900> mark<00:04:14.110> by<00:04:14.230> just

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
note you know making a mark by just

00:04:14.440 --> 00:05:17.120 
note you know making a mark by just
indent<00:04:15.269> we're<00:04:16.269> really<00:04:16.540> trimming<00:04:17.079> off

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.130 

so<00:05:18.130> what<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:18.610> would<00:05:18.700> do<00:05:18.880> is<00:05:19.000> we'd<00:05:19.450> clean<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.960> up

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
so what we would do is we'd clean it up

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:27.660 
so what we would do is we'd clean it up
Oh<00:05:24.570> both<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:26.290> know<00:05:26.410> I'm<00:05:26.560> gonna<00:05:26.710> do<00:05:27.370> some

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
Oh both you know I'm gonna do some

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.640 
Oh both you know I'm gonna do some
cleanup<00:05:28.000> like<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.600> just<00:05:29.020> like<00:05:29.200> doing<00:05:29.500> that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
cleanup like this just like doing that

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.750 
cleanup like this just like doing that
and<00:05:29.830> then<00:05:29.920> I'll<00:05:30.040> probably<00:05:30.250> go<00:05:30.430> back<00:05:30.460> over<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:32.760> -

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
and then I'll probably go back over it -

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.670 
and then I'll probably go back over it -
really

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.910 

clean<00:05:37.680> things<00:05:37.980> down<00:05:39.620> yes<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:43.560> know<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.710> get

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
clean things down yes you know I get

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.780 
clean things down yes you know I get
these<00:05:44.100> edges<00:05:44.750> nice<00:05:45.750> nice<00:05:46.490> because<00:05:47.490> what<00:05:47.700> I've

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
these edges nice nice because what I've

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.610 
these edges nice nice because what I've
been<00:05:47.910> doing<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.300> this<00:05:48.450> I've<00:05:48.630> been<00:05:48.780> just<00:05:48.960> you

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
been doing is this I've been just you

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.610 
been doing is this I've been just you
know<00:05:49.710> getting<00:05:49.980> it<00:05:50.630> cut<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:54.210> now<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.900> can<00:05:55.320> go

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
know getting it cut and now I can go

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:03.350 
know getting it cut and now I can go
back<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:56.660> and<00:06:01.370> then<00:06:02.370> it<00:06:02.460> would<00:06:02.550> just<00:06:02.580> be<00:06:02.940> you

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
back in and then it would just be you

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:13.850 
back in and then it would just be you
know<00:06:03.390> let<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.840> dry<00:06:11.960> well<00:06:12.960> we'll<00:06:13.380> deal<00:06:13.620> with<00:06:13.650> the

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
know let it dry well we'll deal with the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.600 
know let it dry well we'll deal with the
bottom<00:06:14.160> bottom

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
bottom bottom

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.430 
bottom bottom
you<00:06:14.670> know<00:06:14.790> we'd<00:06:15.030> undercut<00:06:15.480> it<00:06:15.660> probably<00:06:16.230> leave

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
right in here it was a little bit it was

right in here it was a little bit it was
a<00:07:02.919> little<00:07:03.279> thin

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 
a little thin

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.330 
a little thin
oh<00:07:03.819> no<00:07:04.139> it's<00:07:05.139> like<00:07:05.319> it's<00:07:05.499> thick<00:07:05.830> down<00:07:06.039> it's

oh no it's like it's thick down it's
right<00:07:06.969> this<00:07:07.300> right<00:07:07.569> down<00:07:07.840> here<00:07:08.259> was<00:07:09.009> a<00:07:09.039> little

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
right this right down here was a little

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.760 
right this right down here was a little
thin<00:07:09.729> right<00:07:09.759> in<00:07:10.180> here<00:07:10.599> and<00:07:11.139> you<00:07:11.259> know<00:07:11.379> this<00:07:11.620> is

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
thin right in here and you know this is

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.580 
thin right in here and you know this is
where<00:07:11.949> I<00:07:11.979> was<00:07:12.189> trimming<00:07:12.520> to<00:07:13.090> to<00:07:13.990> even<00:07:14.379> it<00:07:14.469> out

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
where I was trimming to to even it out

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.709 
where I was trimming to to even it out
and<00:07:14.889> so<00:07:15.460> what<00:07:15.610> I<00:07:15.639> ended<00:07:15.909> up<00:07:16.029> doing<00:07:16.090> was<00:07:16.389> I<00:07:16.539> ended

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:16.719 
and so what I ended up doing was I ended

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.189 
and so what I ended up doing was I ended
up<00:07:16.930> trimming<00:07:17.139> away<00:07:17.379> too<00:07:17.529> much<00:07:18.900> which<00:07:19.900> is<00:07:19.930> the

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
up trimming away too much which is the

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:30.120 
up trimming away too much which is the
problem

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.130 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.780 

which<00:07:30.610> is<00:07:30.760> too<00:07:30.940> bad<00:07:30.970> cuz<00:07:31.330> it

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
which is too bad cuz it

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:39.530 
which is too bad cuz it
but<00:07:34.320> there<00:07:35.320> you<00:07:35.440> go

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:47.270 

perhaps<00:07:40.200> an<00:07:40.560> Evo<00:07:40.980> wort

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.610 

no<00:07:47.820> I<00:07:47.850> didn't<00:07:48.210> mean<00:07:48.330> they're<00:07:48.480> put<00:07:48.690> under<00:07:48.720> key

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
no I didn't mean they're put under key

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.230 
no I didn't mean they're put under key
it's<00:07:49.950> a<00:07:50.040> nice<00:07:50.250> way<00:07:50.460> to<00:07:50.490> make<00:07:50.730> a<00:07:50.760> chart<00:07:51.090> because

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 
it's a nice way to make a chart because

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.250 
it's a nice way to make a chart because
it<00:07:51.389> does<00:07:51.600> mean<00:07:51.840> that<00:07:51.870> that<00:07:52.860> if<00:07:53.630> if<00:07:54.630> you<00:07:54.810> work<00:07:55.080> it

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.260 
it does mean that that if if you work it

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:06.030 
it does mean that that if if you work it
right<00:07:55.290> that<00:07:55.710> you<00:07:55.830> get<00:07:55.980> this<00:07:56.160> beautiful

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.040 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.490 

but<00:08:06.700> not<00:08:07.090> this<00:08:07.330> one<00:08:07.600> twelve<00:08:08.230> and<00:08:08.290> a<00:08:08.380> half

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.500 
but not this one twelve and a half

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.190
