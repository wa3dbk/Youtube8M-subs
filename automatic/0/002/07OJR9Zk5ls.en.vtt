00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.460
 an explorer is that person who 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.140
 when it passes through an abandoned place 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.160
 he is curious to enter feels 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.160
 curiosity inside 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.640
 there are people who do not respect all 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.890
 places we reinforce any 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 entry and we break any window if not 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.860
 we can enter the bums are engaged 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 destroy take away objects and the last 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.880
 that we have for wanting to destroy the place 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.680
 what I like about a place 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.680
 abandoned is the accumulation of sensations 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.450
 is all the information that you can 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.549
 get to find inside what was 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.200
 before your past or those who have 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.850
 lived there the smell of a place 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.250
 abandoned the smell of old the smell of 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.009
 wet the mystery of not knowing what you 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.149
 you find when you get in a corridor 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.149
 when you open a door 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.480
 like history the story that is breathed 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.360
 in them the ancient elements the light 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.760
 what do you see 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.650
 some corners in some rooms and the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 possibility to walk quietly 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.300
 all the time you want to get involved 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.410
 anywhere in buildings where 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.070
 otherwise it would be absolutely 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.070
 impossible 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.850
 but 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 Oh 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.900
 until we go the freedom that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.430
 You feel like you can go where you want and a 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.530
 little too that childish spirit of 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.770
 investigate of exploring of not knowing what 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.980
 you are going to find yourself from the unknown 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.440
 are all those environments that make 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.340
 when you walk through one of these sites is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 some unique sensations
