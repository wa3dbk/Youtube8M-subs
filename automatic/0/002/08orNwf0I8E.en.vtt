00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.520
 hey here is fabio smartphones again 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.080
 are probably now 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.660
 most personal thing we own 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 there are emails on it 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.730
 are messages sms pictures 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.099
 private videos and so on and so forth 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.489
 things we do not want that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.439
 they fall into hands that we do not 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.270
 little acquaintance with samsung therefore offers 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 Give us a service at the exact 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.390
 I checked'd like to do 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.200
 Do not talk about it for long 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.120
 us best 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.370
 in today's show, I'll show you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.220
 how to get a galaxy from over the internet 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.470
 tracks via a browser location 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.240
 the distance is blocked via the internet 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.240
 delete and some more 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.510
 has nominated from the many 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.430
 Uses of samsung life 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 heard he subscribes for free 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 samsung live.com at around this services 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.660
 to be able to use 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.160
 For this you need a samsung account 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.240
 you have this one already you have to 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.180
 just log in 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 if this is not there you can 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.910
 Get free from there 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.950
 to register 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.780
 As I said the registration is free 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 and goes quickly 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.510
 but who read all conditions of use 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 would like to do a lot around the phone 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.550
 you have to connect with the service 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.770
 Finally , the Samsung account on the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.479
 set up a telephone 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.150
 this happens under settings and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.070
 then you could and sync that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.930
 That's it and now we want to have a quick look 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.869
 See what samsung is allowed to do 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.280
 I can briefly introduce everything 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.890
 nominated with son knox is inert knox 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.660
 like his father one right 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.400
 tech-savvy as where now not 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.650
 that he is thieving happy than his 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.990
 Father ignored his phone on the phone 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.700
 couch leaves and he the favor of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.420
 hour to use it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.360
 grab 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 quickly got over it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.670
 play with his buddy this afternoon 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.739
 can 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.500
 papa nobby will notice already nothing 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.500
 thinks of if they so let's see 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.049
 the situation most likely know 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.310
 they put their phone down somewhere 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.110
 and can not find it anymore 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.390
 Stupidly you have the before 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.489
 klingelton put on soundless so that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.260
 now the calling brings nothing more 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.329
 to find it this way 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.000
 with samsung on it can be that 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.950
 then ring the bell via the web itself 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.640
 if the phone is silenced 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.459
 is 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.250
 With the function my mobile you can talk about 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.689
 a click the ringing sound trigger the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.739
 then one minute long 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.049
 The basic requirement is, of course, that 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.909
 the phone has an internet connection 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.569
 yes, if she does not have it with us 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.370
 expected 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.560
 Thank God it sounds like that though 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.319
 end with a wave of the hand and you 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.090
 can continue playing 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.040
 with samsung may be over twelve 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.879
 for hours a motion log 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.970
 create 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.609
 during this time every 15 minutes the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.670
 gps coordinates of the phone 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.989
 and shown on a map 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.030
 So this function does not work for you 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.909
 surveillance can be abused 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.010
 also displayed in the taskbar that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.319
 a location takes place is the phone 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.449
 So this has been stolen 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.370
 probably less here is the 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.290
 next function much more practical 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.359
 with samsung on it can be that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.669
 phone also over the web lock 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.970
 the finder or thief can simultaneously 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.720
 still a message to be transmitted 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.639
 I find that particularly practical 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.650
 functions a mobile number too 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.030
 deposit the then despite closures 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.519
 can be called 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.699
 a finder has the possibility directly 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.949
 from the lobby only to inform 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.840
 that he has his phone in his hand 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.970
 before calling the phone with a 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.639
 Locking the button can be natural 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.680
 another code deposited around the phone 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.720
 unlock later with it 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.639
 then the reassuring feeling that the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.440
 Thief probably first with the 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.840
 phone can no longer start and 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.359
 In any case, no longer to the data 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.079
 comes without the right code goes here 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.079
 first nothing 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.940
 so the phone is locked 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.760
 our data are stupid 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.310
 but now all calls go as well 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.060
 all sms to a phone that we do not 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.220
 have more 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.890
 for many this is a worrying one 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.830
 I think it's absolutely cool 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.170
 The function of samsung is allowed 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.360
 in new german call message forwarding 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.900
 calls it can each have a cellphone number 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.510
 for calls and one for sms 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.060
 become a web for both 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.920
 could be able to create forwarding 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.840
 Samsung can be successful with the 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.940
 connect device appears in the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.490
 taskbar that calls 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.470
 to get redirected 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.070
 By the way the service works too 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.180
 with cell phones from other manufacturers and new ones 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.530
 they do not have to be either 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.270
 I would have stolen my phone 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.780
 worry about who has the thief everything 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.940
 The time announcement in Zimbabwe called the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.160
 complete relationship in australia 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.980
 samsung also answers this 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.020
 ask quickly and easily 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.550
 One click can make the entire call 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.680
 be retrieved 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.300
 In addition to the cost overview can also 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.240
 very much for police investigations 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.410
 be helpful 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.630
 a function maybe on the 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.350
 first look does not seem so useful 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.780
 but still it is really practical 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.520
 for me to lockscreen i know 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.260
 enough people who someday you 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.840
 phone protected by a pin 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.479
 but then you forgot the password 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.270
 is with samsung wave can this 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.600
 fix problem with just one mouse click 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.000
 via web and remote access the phone becomes 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.380
 locked so that after the 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.460
 unlock again be fully on 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.460
 phone is ready to go 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.330
 but probably for me 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.840
 most important function of samsung is allowed 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.969
 wipe out my mobile well in german data 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.009
 delete is the phone 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.439
 irretrievably lost or in 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.169
 wrong hands can all be guessed 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:25.509
 Remove data via web from the phone 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.550
 What I find particularly charming is 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.409
 that you can over samsung also the 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.319
 change memory can erase 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:35.379
 that means sim card or sd 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.129
 Map can be via web and thus off 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.340
 delete the remote 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:41.020
 the phone can be directly to the 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.879
 Reset factory settings 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.979
 You should only do this as a 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.740
 Of course, you do that last step 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.729
 then no more access to the 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.580
 phone via web has you delete it 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:57.129
 through his login password samsung 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.889
 Accounts confirmed the phone 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:04.900
 deleted immediately and it starts with 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:07.029
 fresh installation new if she is 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.900
 visibly with his return 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.099
 bad conscience 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.800
 but it's all good again 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:13.839
 gone and after the new construction all data 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.310
 saved in the cloud should be the 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.849
 new installation also relatively fast 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.490
 go 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:20.490
 until next week new fabi
