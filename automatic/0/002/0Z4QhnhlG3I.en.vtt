like<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.570> big<00:02:08.750> blue<00:02:08.990> I<00:02:09.170> wasn't<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.530> fan<00:02:09.740> of

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
like this big blue I wasn't a fan of

rainbow<00:02:10.220> ride<00:02:10.429> in<00:02:10.670> May<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.180> my<00:02:11.270> feelings

towards<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.080> haven't<00:02:12.440> changed<00:02:12.890> there's<00:02:13.280> just

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
towards it haven't changed there's just

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.340 
towards it haven't changed there's just
something<00:02:13.850> about<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.300> stage<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.840> bugs<00:02:15.230> me

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
something about this stage that bugs me

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.230 
something about this stage that bugs me
though<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:16.040> probably<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.490> safe<00:02:16.730> bet<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.030> to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
though is probably a safe bet is to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.090 
though is probably a safe bet is to
practice<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.750> moving<00:02:17.990> stage<00:02:18.200> again<00:02:18.830> just

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
practice and moving stage again just

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.950 
practice and moving stage again just
like<00:02:19.220> with<00:02:19.400> big<00:02:19.610> blue<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:20.000> starts<00:02:20.420> okay<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
like with big blue it starts okay on the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.510 
like with big blue it starts okay on the
ship<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:21.410> when<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> moves<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:22.040> from<00:02:22.070> there<00:02:22.490> I

ship but when it moves on from there I
look<00:02:22.880> forward<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.270> being<00:02:23.480> back<00:02:23.540> on<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.050> ship

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
look forward to being back on the ship

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.590 
look forward to being back on the ship
this<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.950> first<00:02:25.280> moving<00:02:25.670> stage<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.180> battled

this is the first moving stage I battled
on<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.930> melee<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.410> it's<00:02:27.590> certainly<00:02:27.950> left<00:02:28.130> a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
on in melee and it's certainly left a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.890 
on in melee and it's certainly left a
lasting<00:02:28.430> impression<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:29.450> not<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.810> a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
lasting impression just not in a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.210

a<00:03:13.540> bit<00:03:13.690> more<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.080> wouldn't<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.920> bad<00:03:14.950> but

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
a bit more it wouldn't be so bad but

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.890 
a bit more it wouldn't be so bad but
then<00:03:15.550> I'd<00:03:15.700> probably<00:03:15.850> moan<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.570> was<00:03:16.690> too

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
then I'd probably moan it was too

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560 
pork City because it's a large stage and
I<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.680> hyrule<00:03:39.370> temple<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.820> a<00:03:39.850> large<00:03:40.090> stage<00:03:40.390> as

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
I know hyrule temple is a large stage as

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.450 
I know hyrule temple is a large stage as
well<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.170> makes<00:03:41.350> much<00:03:41.650> better<00:03:41.920> use<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
well but it makes much better use of the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.730 
well but it makes much better use of the
space<00:03:42.580> granted<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.750> wide<00:03:44.020> stage<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.650> it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
space granted it is a wide stage but it

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.440 
space granted it is a wide stage but it
isn't<00:03:45.010> particularly<00:03:45.400> high<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.270> makes

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
isn't particularly high so it makes

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.150 
isn't particularly high so it makes
getting<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.870> KO<00:03:47.080> is<00:03:47.290> much<00:03:47.620> more<00:03:47.860> reasonable

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
getting the KO is much more reasonable

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.820 
getting the KO is much more reasonable

look<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.700> just<00:04:24.970> couldn't<00:04:25.450> come<00:04:25.540> up<00:04:25.570> with

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
look I just couldn't come up with

look I just couldn't come up with
anything<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:26.500> don't<00:04:26.590> know<00:04:26.800> why<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.010> don't

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
anything so I don't know why I don't

primal<00:04:52.040> temple<00:04:52.370> was<00:04:52.580> my<00:04:52.760> favorite<00:04:53.210> stage<00:04:53.390> but

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
primal temple was my favorite stage but

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.810 
primal temple was my favorite stage but
as<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:53.930> played<00:04:54.170> this<00:04:54.320> one<00:04:54.560> Lord<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:55.010> really<00:04:55.640> liked

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
as I played this one Lord I really liked

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.400 
as I played this one Lord I really liked
the<00:04:56.000> simplicity<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.960> stunning

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
the simplicity of it and the stunning

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
them to fight makes it even worse if I

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.680 
them to fight makes it even worse if I

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
match pretty much seems to end up taking

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800 
match pretty much seems to end up taking
place<00:05:28.130> almost<00:05:28.370> entirely<00:05:28.940> in<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.270> top<00:05:29.570> right

hand corner every time but even then

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.970
