00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.770 
the trip a different way that's like all
I<00:03:17.130> think<00:03:17.490> about<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.970> truck<00:03:18.210> is<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.540> oh

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
I think about in the truck is like oh

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.260 
I think about in the truck is like oh
man<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.260> hope<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.650> pull<00:03:19.860> over<00:03:20.010> somewhere<00:03:20.400> where

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
man I hope we pull over somewhere where

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:38.730 
man I hope we pull over somewhere where
this<00:03:21.450> where<00:03:21.840> they<00:03:21.960> need<00:03:22.110> gas<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.890> skate

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.150 

nothing<00:03:39.740> was<00:03:39.860> really<00:03:39.890> tight<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.830> sucks

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
nothing was really tight and it sucks

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.010 
nothing was really tight and it sucks
too<00:03:43.430> because<00:03:43.760> there<00:03:43.940> was<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.270> professional

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
too because there was like professional

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.260 
too because there was like professional
skateboarders<00:03:45.710> there<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.580> couldn't<00:03:46.940> do<00:03:47.090> it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
when they could have done like a really

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.620 
when they could have done like a really
good<00:03:49.070> trick<00:03:49.400> ah<00:03:51.670> he<00:03:52.670> think<00:03:52.910> he<00:03:53.030> can<00:03:53.180> place<00:03:53.420> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
good trick ah he think he can place the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.600 
good trick ah he think he can place the
bet<00:03:53.810> whether<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.110> do<00:03:54.230> or<00:03:54.380> not<00:03:54.650> he<00:03:55.040> said<00:03:55.280> no<00:03:55.430> one

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
bet whether I do or not he said no one

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.540 
bet whether I do or not he said no one
could<00:03:55.760> do<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.030> he<00:03:56.540> even<00:03:56.570> said<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:56.930> could<00:03:57.200> do<00:03:57.320> it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550
