with<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> stick<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.710> auctioneer<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
with a stick and it's the auctioneer and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.119 
with a stick and it's the auctioneer and
this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.360> he<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.600> doing<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> her<00:00:55.260> poking

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
this is what he was doing to her poking

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
this is what he was doing to her poking
her<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.610> pointing<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.210> her<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.539> his<00:00:57.690> stick

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079

and showing how tall and strong she was

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
and showing how tall and strong she was
so<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> language<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.109> scary<00:01:01.980> for

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
so the language is all scary for

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.950 
so the language is all scary for
children<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.449> interesting<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
children but I think it's interesting I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.929 
children but I think it's interesting I
think<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.460> important<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.519> them<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> know

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
think it's important for them to know

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
think it's important for them to know
what<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.470> girl

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
what it was like to be this little girl

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700 
what it was like to be this little girl
being<00:01:07.979> poked<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> stick<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:10.530> also

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
being poked at with a stick and it also

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
being poked at with a stick and it also
talks<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.280> how<00:01:11.549> she<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.970> often<00:01:12.210> beaten

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

until<00:01:13.020> she<00:01:13.320> would<00:01:13.619> bleed<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:15.060> know

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
until she would bleed and that I know

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
until she would bleed and that I know
it's<00:01:15.570> scary<00:01:15.810> language<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> what

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's scary language but it is what

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
it's scary language but it is what
happened<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.869> good<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
happened and so it's good for them to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.030 
happened and so it's good for them to
know<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> talks<00:01:22.890> about

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
know that and so you know it talks about

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
know that and so you know it talks about
being<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> auction<00:01:23.790> block<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:24.869> scary

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.030 
being on the auction block and how scary
that<00:01:25.320> was<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.850> would<00:01:26.970> happen<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and how you would have to work so it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
and how you would have to work so it
goes<00:01:33.270> through<00:01:33.540> sojourners<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.409> Sojourner

and<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.950> images<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.420> interesting<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> mean

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and the images are interesting I mean

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
and the images are interesting I mean
it's<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.320> definitely<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> kind<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> modern

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it's it's definitely a kind of modern

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's it's definitely a kind of modern
art<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.079> they're<00:01:43.439> very<00:01:43.470> dark<00:01:43.920> but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
art and it's very they're very dark but

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.050 
art and it's very they're very dark but
it<00:01:44.700> certainly<00:01:44.909> gets<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.360> point<00:01:45.570> across<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:47.060> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it certainly gets a point across and you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.800
