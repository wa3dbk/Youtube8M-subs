00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.810
 I am here and want to be with me 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 Do you have any mum penguin you know 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.920

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.399

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.190
 I wanted to plant flowers in the garden 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:57.670
 but in the rain that does not work 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.190
 that's why everything wrote to me but what happened 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.729
 means gray in gray 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.750
 I do not understand that that describes 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:12.429
 a mood not a bad mood 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.890
 no, not necessarily rather sad 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:22.509
 rain has thwarted my plans and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.740
