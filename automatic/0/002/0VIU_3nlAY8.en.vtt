00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 your shot where the ultimate goal that 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.670
 you hit a rock hard shot that everything in mind 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 yes yes all frustration maybe the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.130
 according to my 80th minute or site we 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.300
 and we create many opportunities and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.890
 always just right and that chance I x ship 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.010
 full of power and I am lucky of it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.900
 name because I have my pants 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.029
 yes in the first half so just in one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 the tangent went nowhere 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.980
 we made mark in the game that much 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.660
 We created many opportunities 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 I think a penalty score too 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 which is not given a handball 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.989
 it got away very well but be patient 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 always pays to say its there for well 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.320
 lay bleaching 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.220
 yes he was well deserved and we 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.329
 started us off 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.879
 [Music] 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.620
 yes unfortunately what later you could you could 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 certainly the way we reward it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.120
 first half you can do the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.590
 margin for you can rest me in or 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 maybe 200 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.129
 resignation of and then it does 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 easier yes why in that half 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.659
 penalty gevalletjes had in my 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 were more so he says there is only one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.420
 a man who smells the best and it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 of course difficult to see everything as 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.520
 you actually end up with a 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.770
 in then 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 sanders forget and forgive and yes it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.920
 maria is n't that pretty that you aspire 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.320
 Do not take or lose points 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 yes, then will lie nature dates 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 but fortunately also of three points 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.820
 achieved and and we can look forward to again 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.590
 look at your future and start with 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.460
 Thursday you in my ear but with 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.409
 we are a lot of things 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.350
 trying to omnivore the players to one 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.390
 to take another level 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.310
 and then when then such moments is 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.870
 like today for north yes then then 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.210
 you have to be physically and mentally 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.450
 you are ready and the way he is 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.790
 has presented you can see that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.340
 he already has physical metal ready 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 He was also saying I noticed that I had been around for a long time 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.270
 I have not played at this level anymore 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.670
 then there is the understood my top after then come 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.860
 you do not come with ola toivonen with the switch 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.050
 maybe not in recent weeks 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.020
 had easy and then it 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.940
 must show at an important moment 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.989
 yes but I think he responded well 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.189
 and 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.470
 of course it is that must 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.510
 doctrines for late always too late 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.430
 a bit difficult and scared 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.370
 but then you make one today 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.019
 opt for jonathan me but i can 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.280
 the upcoming thunder if possible is possible 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.769
 different again and I have to say that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.060
 that Allah in the limited time that that 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.680
 has obtained showed that he 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.810
 that it is a real prof 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.109
 if you respond that way then it is 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.109
 excellent as he hit the ball 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.690
 pole shit as lazovic sees man 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:48.569
 then basically everything was in the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.230
 by loads yes yes certainly if I do it and 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.560
 angela but also with regard to danko and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.480
 thank him actor 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.490
 yes as the way in 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.660
 is that there are in a very large piece 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.730
 [Music] 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.730
