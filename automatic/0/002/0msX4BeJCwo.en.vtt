00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
opportunity obviously there's certain

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
opportunity obviously there's certain
days<00:00:49.590> where<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.920> left<00:00:50.129> hands<00:00:50.309> better<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.730> my

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
days where my left hands better on my

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.720 
days where my left hands better on my
right<00:00:51.000> hands<00:00:51.210> better<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.800> as<00:00:52.800> far<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.129> yeah

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
right hands better but as far as yeah

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.939 
right hands better but as far as yeah
the<00:00:53.910> transition<00:00:54.420> goes<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.840> uh<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.350> pretty

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the transition goes it's uh it's pretty

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
the transition goes it's uh it's pretty
easy<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> development

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
easy for me now the development

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
easy for me now the development
continues<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.379> both<00:00:58.559> arms<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.309> neither

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
continues for both arms as neither

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360 
continues for both arms as neither
overpowers<00:01:00.840> enough<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> their<00:01:01.739> own<00:01:01.770> no<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
overpowers enough on their own no I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
overpowers enough on their own no I
think<00:01:02.609> he<00:01:02.699> needs<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.000> advantage<00:01:03.329> facing

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
think he needs that advantage facing

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.450 
think he needs that advantage facing
lefties<00:01:04.409> left-handed<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> righties

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
lefties left-handed and righties

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
lefties left-handed and righties
right-handed<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:07.049> something<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
right-handed so that's something I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
right-handed so that's something I
really<00:01:07.770> need<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.880> compete<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.479> level<00:01:09.540> now

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
really need to compete at this level now

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
really need to compete at this level now
when<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> switch<00:01:10.770> pitcher<00:01:11.220> takes<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> mound

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
when a switch pitcher takes the mound

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.760 
when a switch pitcher takes the mound
there's<00:01:12.090> no<00:01:12.299> time<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.630> change<00:01:13.080> his<00:01:13.260> glove<00:01:13.560> in

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
there's no time to change his glove in

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
there's no time to change his glove in
between<00:01:14.100> batters<00:01:14.520> which<00:01:15.060> makes<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.689> unique
