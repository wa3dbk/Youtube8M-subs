00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
now I've done my research about this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.639 
now I've done my research about this
look<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> watched<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.000> couple<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.360> other<00:00:45.649> girls

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
look I watched a couple of other girls

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.020 
look I watched a couple of other girls
tutorials<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> them<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.559> really

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
tutorials and some of them are really

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
tutorials and some of them are really
unnecessarily<00:00:51.030> complicated<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.170> it's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
unnecessarily complicated it and it's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189 
unnecessarily complicated it and it's
it's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.059> simple<00:00:54.300> look<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> they've

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it's a really simple look and they've

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.569 
it's a really simple look and they've
complicated<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> keep<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
complicated it so I'm going to keep it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
complicated it so I'm going to keep it
simple<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.050> no<00:00:58.170> need

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
simple because there really is no need

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
simple because there really is no need
so<00:00:58.789> this<00:00:59.789> one's<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> apply<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.449> land

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so this one's going to apply this land

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420 
so this one's going to apply this land
green<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.320> over<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.680> lid<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.399> the

going<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.490> apply<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.700> little<00:01:21.940> bit<00:01:22.120> of<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.330> line

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
going to apply a little bit of that line

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.390 
going to apply a little bit of that line

is I'm going to apply that and kind of
almost<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.000> brow<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.710> not<00:01:51.710> quite<00:01:52.130> because

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
almost to a brow and not quite because

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.010 
almost to a brow and not quite because
she<00:01:52.550> doesn't<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:53.030> quite<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> brown

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
she doesn't have it quite to the brown

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.810 
she doesn't have it quite to the brown
so<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.130> then<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.340> them<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:55.550> give<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.790> a

so and then of them just give it a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:12.210 
so and then of them just give it a
little<00:01:55.910> blend

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.130

in between your fingers so that it

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.550 
in between your fingers so that it
glides<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.930> bit<00:02:49.020> nicer<00:02:49.230> because

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
glides on a little bit nicer because

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.290 
glides on a little bit nicer because
it's<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.920> bit<00:02:50.070> stiff<00:02:52.640> by<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.700> way<00:02:53.880> I'm<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
about the simplicity of a look kind of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.850 
about the simplicity of a look kind of
thing<00:02:58.770> well<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.610> was<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:01.020> know<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.410> had<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:01.830> in

my<00:03:01.980> head<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.520> while<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.790> looks<00:03:03.570> mean

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
my head for a while that looks mean

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.690 
my head for a while that looks mean
really<00:03:04.560> complicated<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.460> kind<00:03:05.640> of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
really complicated and that kind of

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.240 
really complicated and that kind of
thing<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:06.150> order<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.660> good<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.290> right<00:03:07.500> but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
thing in order to be good and right but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
thing in order to be good and right but
and<00:03:08.460> I<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:08.880> inspired<00:03:09.120> by<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.900> makeup

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and I was actually inspired by a makeup

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.350 
and I was actually inspired by a makeup
artist<00:03:10.320> called<00:03:10.740> Wayne<00:03:11.040> whose<00:03:11.550> name<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.180> here

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
is gossmakeupartist and he really

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.540 
is gossmakeupartist and he really
champions<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.470> whole<00:03:16.620> idea<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.160> simple

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
champions the whole idea of a simple

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.930 
champions the whole idea of a simple
look<00:03:17.910> that's<00:03:18.180> easy<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.570> do<00:03:18.690> because<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.680> know

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
look that's easy to do because you know

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
look that's easy to do because you know
really<00:03:20.940> complicated<00:03:21.420> look<00:03:21.600> sometimes

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
really complicated look sometimes

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.630 
really complicated look sometimes
they're<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.410> complicated<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.220> no<00:03:23.310> reason

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
they're just complicated for no reason

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.940 
they're just complicated for no reason
why<00:03:23.730> was<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.510> video<00:03:24.750> she's<00:03:25.350> wearing<00:03:25.710> a
