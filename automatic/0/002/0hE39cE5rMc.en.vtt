00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
know still in its you know build

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.039 
know still in its you know build
conditions<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> great

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
conditions and it is not so great

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.149 
conditions and it is not so great
as<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.250> paranoid<00:01:29.729> android

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.770 

Sanj<00:01:35.969> and<00:01:36.149> mod<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:39.149> course<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.929> okay<00:01:40.710> P

wrongs which have software of their

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.309 
wrongs which have software of their
future<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.819> pretty<00:02:42.030> good<00:02:42.299> app<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.959> you

future so it is a pretty good app if you

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.860 
future so it is a pretty good app if you
have<00:02:43.530> build<00:02:43.829> one<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.280> me<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.660> Bill

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
have build one like me if there is Bill

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.479 
have build one like me if there is Bill

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
drive up calls if you you lags and if

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.219 
drive up calls if you you lags and if
you<00:05:35.200> are<00:05:35.320> using<00:05:35.560> browser<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:37.180> extensively<00:05:37.840> and

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
you are using browser so extensively and

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.640 
you are using browser so extensively and
then<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.979> may<00:05:39.280> crash<00:05:39.669> down<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.690> says<00:05:40.960> like
