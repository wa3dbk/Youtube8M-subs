00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
related to that but by the end of the

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.610 
related to that but by the end of the
series<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.900> mean<00:03:34.900> it's<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.140> short<00:03:35.410> stick

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
series I mean it's a short stick

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.170 
series I mean it's a short stick
substitute<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.400> by<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.549> end<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:36.940> series

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
substitute but by the end of this series

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.800 
substitute but by the end of this series
you<00:03:37.329> could<00:03:37.900> tell<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.090> if<00:03:40.180> you're<00:03:40.390> interested

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
you could tell so if you're interested

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.259 
you could tell so if you're interested
in<00:03:40.840> checking<00:03:40.930> out<00:03:41.230> gun<00:03:41.470> Buster<00:03:41.859> -<00:03:42.100> maybe<00:03:43.090> you

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
in checking out gun Buster - maybe you

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.520 
in checking out gun Buster - maybe you
don't<00:03:43.450> have<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.810> see<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.079> original<00:03:44.380> gun

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
don't have to see the original gun

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.740 
don't have to see the original gun
buster<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:44.949> I<00:03:45.040> suggest<00:03:45.459> it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:04:00.400 

and<00:03:50.750> then<00:03:51.880> finally<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:58.780> Armitage<00:03:59.780> three

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
and then finally we have Armitage three

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:08.650 
and then finally we have Armitage three
I<00:04:03.430> think<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.580> is<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.910> OVA<00:04:07.390> 140<00:04:08.390> minutes

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
I think this is the OVA 140 minutes

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.050 
I think this is the OVA 140 minutes
could<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:11.590> Harmon<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:13.460> this<00:04:13.640> actually

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
could be Harmon is this actually

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.620 
could be Harmon is this actually
pronounced<00:04:14.870> Armitage<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:16.130> third<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.730> don't

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
pronounced Armitage the third I don't

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.530 
pronounced Armitage the third I don't
know<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:18.200> one<00:04:18.380> would<00:04:18.530> be<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.770> polymatrix

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
know this one would be the polymatrix

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.130 
know this one would be the polymatrix
movie<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:20.840> guess<00:04:22.150> I'm<00:04:23.150> not<00:04:23.300> entirely<00:04:23.570> sure<00:04:23.780> I'd

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
movie I guess I'm not entirely sure I'd

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.400 
movie I guess I'm not entirely sure I'd
need<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.500> watch<00:04:24.680> it<00:04:24.710> find<00:04:25.160> out<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:26.690> then

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
need to watch it find out and then

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.220 
need to watch it find out and then
finally<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.830> also<00:04:28.250> got<00:04:29.350> Armitage<00:04:30.350> dual<00:04:30.920> matrix

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
finally I also got Armitage dual matrix

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.030 
finally I also got Armitage dual matrix
this<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:34.000> this<00:04:35.000> one<00:04:35.240> didn't<00:04:35.750> come<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.650> its<00:04:36.860> own

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
this is this one didn't come on its own

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.300 
this is this one didn't come on its own

there<00:04:50.300> was<00:04:50.450> some<00:04:50.720> styrofoam<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.800> keep<00:04:51.980> things

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
there was some styrofoam to keep things

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.600 
there was some styrofoam to keep things
from<00:04:52.310> moving<00:04:52.550> around<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.680> this<00:04:54.680> box<00:04:55.010> for<00:04:55.460> the

from moving around and this box for the
anime<00:04:56.090> figurine<00:04:56.540> that<00:04:56.570> came<00:04:56.930> with<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.230> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
anime figurine that came with it and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.270 
anime figurine that came with it and
this<00:04:59.780> would<00:05:00.020> be<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.260> anime<00:05:00.620> figuring<00:05:01.070> that

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
this would be the anime figuring that

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.920 
this would be the anime figuring that
came<00:05:01.610> with<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:04.300> haven't<00:05:05.300> quite<00:05:05.450> figured<00:05:05.720> out

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
came with it I haven't quite figured out

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.920 
came with it I haven't quite figured out
what<00:05:06.320> I'm<00:05:06.830> supposed<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.190> do<00:05:07.370> with<00:05:07.580> this<00:05:07.940> these

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
what I'm supposed to do with this these

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.810 
what I'm supposed to do with this these
are<00:05:09.050> some<00:05:09.200> handcuffs<00:05:09.680> that<00:05:09.950> came<00:05:10.100> with<00:05:10.280> her

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.140 

it's<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.780> bit<00:05:16.200> stranger<00:05:17.070> for<00:05:17.370> figuring<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:18.000> mean

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
it's a bit stranger for figuring I mean

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.980 
it's a bit stranger for figuring I mean
the<00:05:19.520> limbs<00:05:20.520> actually<00:05:21.210> are<00:05:22.220> not<00:05:23.220> solid<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:24.180> it's

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
the limbs actually are not solid so it's

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.300 
the limbs actually are not solid so it's
not<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.170> just<00:05:25.470> stand<00:05:25.800> there

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
not a just stand there

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.820 
not a just stand there
the<00:05:26.670> legs<00:05:26.910> were<00:05:27.300> flexible<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:28.290> she<00:05:28.560> didn't

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
the legs were flexible so she didn't

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.630 
the legs were flexible so she didn't
quite<00:05:29.370> stand<00:05:29.910> perfectly<00:05:30.390> on<00:05:30.810> her<00:05:30.960> base<00:05:31.640> she

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
quite stand perfectly on her base she

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.930 
quite stand perfectly on her base she
came<00:05:32.820> out<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.960> handgun<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:35.040> can<00:05:35.190> put<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.490> her

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
came out the handgun you can put in her

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.970 
came out the handgun you can put in her
hand<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:36.420> I'm<00:05:36.630> guess<00:05:36.930> my<00:05:37.230> guess<00:05:37.440> has<00:05:37.620> been<00:05:37.770> that

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
hand so I'm guess my guess has been that

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.560 
hand so I'm guess my guess has been that
the<00:05:39.080> handcuffs<00:05:40.080> are<00:05:40.200> an<00:05:40.290> alternative<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:40.980> that

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
the handcuffs are an alternative to that

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.800 
the handcuffs are an alternative to that
and<00:05:42.570> then<00:05:42.960> her<00:05:43.370> glasses<00:05:44.370> also<00:05:45.090> didn't<00:05:45.600> come<00:05:45.780> on

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
and then her glasses also didn't come on

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.680 
and then her glasses also didn't come on
her<00:05:46.580> very<00:05:47.580> strange<00:05:49.610> well<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:51.240> would<00:05:51.390> be<00:05:51.420> this

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
her very strange well that would be this

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.650 
her very strange well that would be this
week's<00:05:51.960> anime<00:05:52.350> DVD<00:05:52.740> update<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.450> think<00:05:54.450> next

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
week's anime DVD update I think next

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.230 
week's anime DVD update I think next
week<00:05:54.960> as<00:05:55.340> everything<00:05:56.340> comes<00:05:56.550> out<00:05:56.670> on<00:05:56.820> time<00:05:57.000> we

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
week as everything comes out on time we

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.970 
week as everything comes out on time we
should<00:05:57.390> have<00:05:57.540> a<00:05:57.750> very<00:05:57.960> big<00:05:58.140> update<00:05:58.530> without<00:05:58.830> me

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
should have a very big update without me

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.210 
should have a very big update without me
