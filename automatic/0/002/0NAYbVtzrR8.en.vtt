no actually let me see let's check the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.760 
no actually let me see let's check the
stall<00:02:43.910> characteristics<00:02:44.350> let<00:02:45.350> me<00:02:45.440> get<00:02:45.590> at

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
stall characteristics let me get at

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.080 
stall characteristics let me get at
least<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.070> couple<00:02:46.220> mistakes<00:02:46.460> I'm<00:02:46.790> going

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
least a couple mistakes I'm going

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.250 
least a couple mistakes I'm going
through<00:02:47.210> this<00:02:47.330> thing<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.600> like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.600 

it<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:54.620> amazing<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.040> can't<00:02:55.310> wait<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.520> get

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
it is it's amazing I can't wait to get

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.840 
it is it's amazing I can't wait to get
mine<00:02:55.850> built<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.300> four<00:02:56.510> cells<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.730> that's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
mine built with the four cells so that's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.170 
mine built with the four cells so that's
throttle<00:02:59.300> off<00:02:59.530> hands<00:03:00.530> off<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.890> sticks<00:03:01.190> it

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
throttle off hands off the sticks it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.030 
throttle off hands off the sticks it
definitely<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.690> tail-heavy<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.650> think<00:03:03.980> we

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
definitely is tail-heavy I think we

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.920 
definitely is tail-heavy I think we
should<00:03:04.190> land<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.550> change<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.000> CG<00:03:05.360> do<00:03:05.540> some<00:03:05.720> sub

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
should land it change the CG do some sub

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.180 
should land it change the CG do some sub
trims<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.380> some<00:03:06.560> more<00:03:06.650> flight<00:03:06.860> footage

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
trims and do some more flight footage

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.440 
trims and do some more flight footage
okay<00:03:09.190> see<00:03:10.190> how<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.400> lands<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.850> baited<00:03:11.270> lands

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450

we<00:06:12.000> got<00:06:12.030> fpv<00:06:12.510> gear<00:06:12.720> on<00:06:12.840> here<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.320> could

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
we got fpv gear on here it could

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.600 
we got fpv gear on here it could
probably<00:06:13.620> take<00:06:13.860> a<00:06:13.920> little<00:06:14.070> bit<00:06:14.280> more<00:06:14.460> weight

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
probably take a little bit more weight
