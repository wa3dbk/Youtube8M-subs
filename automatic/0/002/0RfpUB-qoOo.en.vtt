and I I'm not sure I'm really clear how
what's<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.930> difference<00:00:07.519> yeah<00:00:08.519> composer

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
what's the difference yeah composer

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.009

to deal with the director he's writing
music<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.670> film<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.420> there<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:15.960> limitations

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
music for film so there are limitations

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.460 
music for film so there are limitations
and<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.690> that<00:00:18.690> whole<00:00:18.960> emotional<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:21.380> kind<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and and that whole emotional and kind of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.040 
and and that whole emotional and kind of
skills<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.760> Orchestra<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> takes<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
skills on Orchestra it takes what the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.120 
skills on Orchestra it takes what the
composer<00:00:25.350> writes<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.119> makes<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.830> sound<00:00:28.830> like

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
composer writes and makes it sound like

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.260 
composer writes and makes it sound like
what<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> composer<00:00:29.670> thinks<00:00:30.119> he<00:00:30.240> wrote<00:00:30.859> okay

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
what the composer thinks he wrote okay

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.139 
what the composer thinks he wrote okay
because<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.329> often<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.020> know<00:00:35.149> with

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
because I often you know with

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.060 
because I often you know with
instrumentation<00:00:36.750> yeah<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> stuff<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.530> back

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
instrumentation yeah and stuff like back

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.700 
instrumentation yeah and stuff like back
then<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> daniels<00:00:39.870> banging<00:00:40.140> piano<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
then it was a daniels banging piano and
he<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:41.160> write<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.489> sketches<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.270> know

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
he would write out sketches you know

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
he would write out sketches you know
thinking<00:00:42.660> he'd<00:00:42.809> want<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.190> strings

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
thinking he'd want you know the strings

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100 
thinking he'd want you know the strings

and<00:01:12.330> most<00:01:13.170> composers<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> full

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and most composers have to do full

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.850 
and most composers have to do full
mock-ups<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> directors<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> hear<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
mock-ups so the directors can hear you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
mock-ups so the directors can hear you
know<00:01:16.979> synthesizers<00:01:17.580> basically<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.060> samplers

the<00:01:30.840> scoring<00:01:31.170> stage<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.159> could<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> disaster

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the scoring stage it could be a disaster

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
the scoring stage it could be a disaster
that<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:34.110> composer's<00:01:34.590> written<00:01:35.130> something

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that the composer's written something

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
that the composer's written something
literally<00:01:36.150> different<00:01:36.600> different<00:01:36.780> than<00:01:36.960> what

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
literally different different than what

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
what the director thought he was giving

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
what the director thought he was giving
and<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> waste<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.170> lot<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.350> money

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and and then you waste a lot of money

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
and and then you waste a lot of money
and<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> lot<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> time<00:01:41.189> either<00:01:41.759> trying<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> bang

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and a lot of time either trying to bang

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
and a lot of time either trying to bang
it<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.630> together<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> cancel<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it in together or you cancel and you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
it in together or you cancel and you
know<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:46.860> so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
know start over and it's so that's so

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
know start over and it's so that's so
it's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:47.670> thing<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.420> bad<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it's a good thing but the bad thing is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.240 
it's a good thing but the bad thing is

sometimes we're following the dub by a
day<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> make<00:02:57.209> sure<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.390> record

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
day so we have to make sure and record

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.680
