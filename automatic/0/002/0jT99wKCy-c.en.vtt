00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
cable and take a look a weird

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.740 
cable and take a look a weird
proprietary<00:00:25.920> connector<00:00:26.550> not<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.210> same<00:00:27.449> as

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
proprietary connector not the same as

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.689 
proprietary connector not the same as
the<00:00:27.900> last<00:00:28.080> Blackjacks<00:00:28.769> connector<00:00:29.220> no<00:00:29.490> good

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the last Blackjacks connector no good

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
the last Blackjacks connector no good
there's<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> battery<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.619> me

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
there's the battery and you can see me

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680 
there's the battery and you can see me
hefting<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.759> basically<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
hefting it there it is basically the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.440 
hefting it there it is basically the
same<00:00:33.930> size<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.250> original<00:00:35.579> Blackjacks

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
same size as the original Blackjacks

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.810 
same size as the original Blackjacks
extended<00:00:37.260> battery<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.950> they've<00:00:38.219> managed<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
extended battery and they've managed to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.030 
extended battery and they've managed to
find<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.660> cram<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.290> basically<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
find a way to cram it into basically the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.400 
find a way to cram it into basically the
same<00:00:41.250> form<00:00:41.579> factor<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.110> gonna<00:00:43.230> get

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
same form factor so this is gonna get

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.080 
same form factor so this is gonna get
much<00:00:43.649> better<00:00:43.920> battery<00:00:44.280> life<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> original

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
much better battery life in the original

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.799 
much better battery life in the original
so<00:00:45.710> let's<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.920> turn<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.809> miss

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
compare it to first is going to be uh

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
compare it to first is going to be uh
huh<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> original<00:01:38.549> black<00:01:38.700> jack<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.960> can

see<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> new<00:01:40.740> black<00:01:40.920> jack<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.270> know

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
see the new black jack is a I don't know

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.370 
see the new black jack is a I don't know
much<00:01:42.659> cooler<00:01:42.869> looking<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.479> tiny

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
much cooler looking it is just a tiny

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960 
much cooler looking it is just a tiny
bit<00:01:46.619> thicker<00:01:46.979> through<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> main<00:01:47.670> body

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
bit thicker through the main body

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
bit thicker through the main body
although<00:01:48.270> they're<00:01:48.540> about<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> same

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
although they're about the same

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.569 
although they're about the same
thickness<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> include<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> extra

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
thickness when you include the extra

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.780 
thickness when you include the extra
battery<00:01:51.000> hump<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:53.009> new<00:01:53.159> black<00:01:53.369> jack<00:01:53.610> at

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
battery hump there the new black jack at

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.039 
battery hump there the new black jack at
least<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> black<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> one

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
least in the black here which is the one

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.990 
least in the black here which is the one
we<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.470> obviously<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> fingerprint

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
we have obviously is a fingerprint

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
we have obviously is a fingerprint
magnet<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> red<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.469> bit<00:01:58.590> less

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
magnet but the red is a little bit less

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.999 
magnet but the red is a little bit less
so<00:01:59.060> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> little

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
so you can see there it's just a little

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.880 
so you can see there it's just a little
bit<00:02:02.250> thicker<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:04.079> feels<00:02:04.350> great<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
bit thicker but it feels great in the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
bit thicker but it feels great in the
hand<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> let's<00:02:06.810> also

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
hand I really like it and let's also

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
hand I really like it and let's also
compare<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.459> q9h

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
compare it to the the q9h

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.360 
compare it to the the q9h
or<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> q9<00:02:10.229> global<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.160> known

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
or the q9 global as it's known

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.580 
or the q9 global as it's known
the<00:02:12.640> blackjack<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.480> course<00:02:13.720> not<00:02:13.959> nearly<00:02:14.290> as

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
the blackjack is of course not nearly as

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.259 
the blackjack is of course not nearly as
wide<00:02:14.890> as<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.400> q9h

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
wide as the q9h

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.199 
wide as the q9h
it<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.659> not<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> gigantic<00:02:17.470> slab<00:02:18.069> I'll<00:02:19.060> be

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
it is not a gigantic slab I'll be

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.970 
it is not a gigantic slab I'll be
talking<00:02:19.390> more<00:02:19.599> about<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.409> later<00:02:20.560> post

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
talking more about that in a later post

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.309 
talking more about that in a later post
I<00:02:21.310> disagree<00:02:22.209> with<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.390> boy<00:02:22.540> genius<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.110> think

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
I disagree with the boy genius I think

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.170 
I disagree with the boy genius I think
the<00:02:23.409> blackjack<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.980> much<00:02:24.220> better<00:02:24.430> than<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> q9

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
the blackjack is much better than the q9

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
the blackjack is much better than the q9
but<00:02:25.480> we'll<00:02:26.200> get<00:02:26.290> back<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.709> little<00:02:26.739> bit

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
but we'll get back to that a little bit

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.509 
but we'll get back to that a little bit
what<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:27.879> want<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.330> now<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.959> focus<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.250> the

what I want to do now is focus in on the

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.569 
what I want to do now is focus in on the
