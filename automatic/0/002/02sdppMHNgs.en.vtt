a team<00:02:35.490> safe<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.480> booster<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:38.820> makes

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
a team safe it's a booster that it makes

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.480 
a team safe it's a booster that it makes
it<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.140> don't<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.590> stunned<00:02:40.920> by<00:02:41.100> grenades

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
it so you don't get stunned by grenades

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.120 
it so you don't get stunned by grenades
and<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.000> also<00:02:42.150> makes<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.840> your<00:02:43.710> teammates

grenade throws I really like it because

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.890 
grenade throws I really like it because

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
just really really like perks that where

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.690 
just really really like perks that where
it<00:03:01.550> makes<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.760> harder<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.480> die<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.700> um

like boosters that reward you for dying

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700 
like boosters that reward you for dying
for<00:03:12.150> example<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:12.750> revenge<00:03:13.200> where<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> drop

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
for example like revenge where you drop

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
mean I'm not saying those are bad

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.850 
mean I'm not saying those are bad
boosters<00:03:20.340> at<00:03:20.490> all<00:03:20.670> but<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:22.080> don't<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:22.740> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
boosters at all but I I don't like the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.470 
boosters at all but I I don't like the
idea<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.460> can<00:03:23.550> only<00:03:23.700> fully<00:03:24.240> take

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
idea that you can only fully take

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.980 
idea that you can only fully take
advantage<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:25.080> them<00:03:25.230> when<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.710> die<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.960> for<00:03:27.960> a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
advantage of them when you die and for a

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.690 
advantage of them when you die and for a
person<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:28.410> myself<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:29.010> want<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.250> try<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.550> die

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
person like myself I want to try and die

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.950 
person like myself I want to try and die
as<00:03:30.000> least<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.200> possible<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.690> want<00:03:33.840> to

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
as least as possible so I don't want to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.960 
as least as possible so I don't want to
have<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.110> idea<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.740> oh<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.460> can<00:03:35.610> be<00:03:35.730> better

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
have this idea that oh I can be better

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.120 
have this idea that oh I can be better
when<00:03:36.210> I'm<00:03:36.330> dead<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:37.680> doesn't<00:03:37.980> make<00:03:38.070> sense

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
when I'm dead that doesn't make sense

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.150 
when I'm dead that doesn't make sense
that<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.330> doesn't<00:03:39.870> sound<00:03:40.140> right<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.650> mean<00:03:41.130> I

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
that it doesn't sound right I mean I

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.830 
that it doesn't sound right I mean I
think<00:03:41.280> isn't<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.940> why<00:03:42.120> Fleetfoot<00:03:42.480> is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
think isn't that why Fleetfoot is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.290 
think isn't that why Fleetfoot is
arguably<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.410> best<00:03:43.800> booster<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.880> game<00:03:45.090> in

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
arguably the best booster in the game in

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.420 
arguably the best booster in the game in
the<00:03:45.330> most<00:03:45.570> overpowered<00:03:46.200> because<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.100> makes<00:03:47.130> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the most overpowered because it makes it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.680 
the most overpowered because it makes it
so<00:03:47.580> you're<00:03:47.730> harder<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> kill<00:03:48.330> because<00:03:48.480> you're

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
so you're harder to kill because you're

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.360 
so you're harder to kill because you're
moving<00:03:48.989> around<00:03:49.230> faster<00:03:49.830> when<00:03:50.100> you're<00:03:50.130> in

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
moving around faster when you're in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.330 
moving around faster when you're in
gunfights<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.090> everything<00:03:51.830> but<00:03:52.830> anyway<00:03:53.160> yeah

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
gunfights and everything but anyway yeah

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.970 
gunfights and everything but anyway yeah
team<00:03:53.610> safe<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.940> just<00:03:54.180> really<00:03:54.450> cool<00:03:54.630> because

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
team safe is just really cool because

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.250 
team safe is just really cool because
it's<00:03:55.980> just<00:03:56.070> really<00:03:56.370> fun<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.910> like<00:03:57.480> for<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
it's just really fun and like for a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.960 
it's just really fun and like for a
person<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.680> me<00:03:58.800> I'm<00:03:59.160> always<00:03:59.400> trying<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.850> use

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
person like me I'm always trying to use

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.229 
person like me I'm always trying to use
automatic<00:04:00.420> guns<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.489> when<00:04:02.489> I'm<00:04:02.880> going

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
automatic guns and when I'm going

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.880 
automatic guns and when I'm going
against<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.630> gym<00:04:03.870> all<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.200> need<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.560> try<00:04:04.739> and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
against the gym all I need to try and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.949 
against the gym all I need to try and
make<00:04:05.010> sure<00:04:05.040> I'm<00:04:05.400> always<00:04:05.700> aiming<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.750> trying

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
make sure I'm always aiming and trying

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.330 
make sure I'm always aiming and trying
to<00:04:07.080> take<00:04:07.200> my<00:04:07.380> shots<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.800> don't<00:04:07.950> have<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.160> worry

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
to take my shots I don't have to worry

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.699 
to take my shots I don't have to worry
again<00:04:08.430> about<00:04:08.640> getting<00:04:09.480> stunned<00:04:09.840> or<00:04:10.410> grenades

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
again about getting stunned or grenades

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.610 
again about getting stunned or grenades
getting<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.280> way<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.760> because<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.900> need<00:04:13.290> to

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
getting in the way and because I need to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.920 
getting in the way and because I need to
get<00:04:13.769> all<00:04:13.980> my<00:04:14.160> shots<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.730> or<00:04:14.970> else<00:04:15.330> I'm<00:04:15.870> not

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
get all my shots in or else I'm not

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.020 
get all my shots in or else I'm not
going<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.350> win<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> gunfight<00:04:16.980> so<00:04:17.459> team<00:04:17.760> save

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
going to win the gunfight so team save

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.430 
going to win the gunfight so team save
kind<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.330> ensures<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.690> for<00:04:18.989> me<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.290> it's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
kind of ensures that for me and it's

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.060 
kind of ensures that for me and it's
really<00:04:19.560> good<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:21.299> think<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.530> just<00:04:22.590> makes<00:04:22.950> it

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
really good and I think it just makes it

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.920 
really good and I think it just makes it
more<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.730> viable<00:04:24.120> option<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.570> me<00:04:24.840> in

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
more of a viable option for me in

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.930 
more of a viable option for me in
gunfights<00:04:25.350> since<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.190> just<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.640> have<00:04:26.730> to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
gunfights since I just don't have to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.790 
gunfights since I just don't have to
worry<00:04:27.150> about<00:04:27.330> grenades<00:04:27.840> as<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> problem<00:04:28.590> you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
worry about grenades as a problem you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.880 
worry about grenades as a problem you
know<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.240> i<00:04:30.240> guess<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.080> one<00:04:31.530> thing<00:04:31.770> i

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
know and i guess like the one thing i

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.550 
know and i guess like the one thing i
really<00:04:31.919> don't<00:04:32.700> like<00:04:32.940> about<00:04:33.150> team<00:04:33.540> save<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
really don't like about team save is the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.380 
really don't like about team save is the
fact<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.130> have<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.430> level<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.910> up<00:04:36.090> so

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
fact that you have to level it up so

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.200 
fact that you have to level it up so
much<00:04:36.600> with<00:04:36.960> like<00:04:37.110> 45<00:04:37.800> high<00:04:38.010> fives<00:04:38.310> but<00:04:38.970> anyway
