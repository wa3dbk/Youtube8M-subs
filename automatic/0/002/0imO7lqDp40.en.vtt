here's<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> game<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.360> really

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
here's where the game really really

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.230 
here's where the game really really
shines<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.460> bonus<00:01:11.790> levels<00:01:12.090> are

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
shines I think that you bonus levels are

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
shines I think that you bonus levels are
way<00:01:12.390> funnier<00:01:12.720> than<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> actual<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.260> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
way funnier than the actual game so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.370 
way funnier than the actual game so
because<00:01:14.880> there's<00:01:15.150> no<00:01:15.299> shooting<00:01:15.689> no<00:01:15.720> grappling

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because there's no shooting no grappling

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
because there's no shooting no grappling
hook<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:17.490> flying<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.509> boosting<00:01:19.670> and
