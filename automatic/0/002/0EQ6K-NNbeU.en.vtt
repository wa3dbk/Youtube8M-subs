00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.090
 yes 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.070
 joe names team public nintendo and 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.160
 intelligent systems program is 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.680
 inevitable to compare with steam with the most 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.050
 recent version of explore both are 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.820
 turn-based strategy games in the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.310
 that the characters move in a 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.800
 grid both face an army 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.720
 assortment of aliens against a force 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.260
 special armed to the teeth and 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.420
 both are created by developers 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.579
 extremely experienced 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.340
 unfortunately cummings team does not 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.340
 feel the intriguing and enveloping game 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.859
 that many of us would like it to be the most 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.260
 big sin of the game of intelligent 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.870
 responsible systems of the fire series 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.089
 emblem is not to include the option of a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.940
 Free camera that allows you to see the map 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.460
 from above to plan your strategy 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.140
 your system works based on a 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.820
 camera that goes behind the player to 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.440
 style and software and that can 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.230
 be controlled with the four buttons 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.940
 front of the tri 10 direct a camera 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.610
 with that quartet of buttons is a 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.170
 strange feeling even if it turns out 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.240
 ingenious solution to solve the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.990
 absence of the control stick of the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.759
 camera 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.850
 the system works while you 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.790
 character advances and shoots but in the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.810
 instant when you run out of steam 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.759
 represents the number of spaces and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.950
 actions that can make a point 1 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.380
 just as your character is at 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.780
 discovered so that the enemies what 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.149
 massacre and punish without mercy the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.179
 System defects remain in view of 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.179
 everyone 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.409
 and st 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.630
 as I was saying is a game with 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.360
 very different needs of uac iron 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.840
 since the coverage of the rts should 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.210
 plan 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.340
 you just have to stick a wall so soon 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.679
 received is a bullet and in crown einstein 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.409
 receiving a bullet involves receiving two 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.289
 bullets or three or four since you can not 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.270
 move while attacking you on top of everything 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.219
 if your enemies move and not the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.110
 you have in the angle of vision of your 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.480
 characters something that happens with 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.250
 often you will simply stay there 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.610
 stuck watching a screen that says 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.760
 turn of the enemy for times that maybe 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.030
 they are not so long but they feel 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.069
 like an eternity 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.860
 with regard to the plot and the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.110
 characters we can not connect 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.690
 with nothing the idea of â€‹â€‹a universe 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.420
 steampunk in which abraham lincoln is 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.360
 the boss of the defense of the earth 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.280
 it always did not sound intriguing in that 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.590
 cascade of dialog balloons 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.930
 inconsequential during and between 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.390
 battles really ended up 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.580
 force us to press all the buttons 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.280
 to jump immediately and return to 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.070
 the hobbled action as soon as possible to 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.080
 end the duality between use of 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.000
 buttons and use of touch screen results 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.040
 on the one hand as grisly and 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.380
 we said you can direct the camera with 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.870
 buttons but you can also use the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.750
 part of attack however at the moment 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.600
 the end of the turn the only way to 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.610
 finish is through the screen the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.280
 problem is that the detection of a finger 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.130
 it is not so precise what compels us to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 play with the stylus or press on a 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.569
 little seat on the screen 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 attitude is not detected is a 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.099
 obviously annoyance 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.280
 when you realize you 're 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.010
 suffering so much james dean for so many 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.680
 tiny details that the case has 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.280
 keep playing it when you could well 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.629
 buy for a lot less excom in a 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:51.930
 tablet or phone and start playing with 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.930
 stimuli with some buttons of 5 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.690
 must have in January 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.690
