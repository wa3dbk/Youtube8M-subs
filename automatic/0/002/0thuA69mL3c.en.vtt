00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hi this is haley and i'm going to teach

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi this is haley and i'm going to teach
you<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.360> make<00:00:03.540> an<00:00:03.750> origami<00:00:03.870> dog<00:00:04.529> so<00:00:05.009> it

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
you how to make an origami dog so it

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.120 
you how to make an origami dog so it
should<00:00:05.250> look<00:00:05.400> like<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:06.589> right<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:07.919> and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
should look like this right here and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.790 
should look like this right here and
then<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:09.120> first<00:00:09.660> thing<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:09.960> origami<00:00:10.440> is

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
then so first thing about origami is

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860 
then so first thing about origami is
that<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.070> always<00:00:11.280> need<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> square<00:00:12.269> piece<00:00:12.840> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
that you always need a square piece of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.829 
that you always need a square piece of
paper<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.730> perfect<00:00:14.730> square<00:00:14.910> piece<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> paper<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
paper a perfect square piece of paper it

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.510 
paper a perfect square piece of paper it
could<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.049> any<00:00:16.199> color<00:00:16.470> any<00:00:16.590> size<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.369> just

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
could be any color any size but it just

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.660 
could be any color any size but it just
has<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.940> perfect<00:00:18.119> square<00:00:18.449> okay<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
has to be a perfect square okay so the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
has to be a perfect square okay so the
first<00:00:20.699> thing<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.270> make<00:00:21.359> an<00:00:21.510> origami<00:00:21.660> dog<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
first thing to make an origami dog is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.519 
first thing to make an origami dog is
that<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.400> each<00:00:24.269> fold<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.900> square<00:00:25.289> piece<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that you each fold this square piece of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.580 
that you each fold this square piece of
paper<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.949> half<00:00:26.449> like<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.410> should<00:00:28.560> be

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
paper in half like this so it should be

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.269 
paper in half like this so it should be
triangle<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:30.019> then<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.349> cut<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
triangle and then you cut it down this

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.979 
triangle and then you cut it down this
line<00:00:32.579> what's<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.510> pair<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> scissors<00:00:35.989> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
line what's the pair of scissors and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.190 
line what's the pair of scissors and
then<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.890> should<00:00:38.070> end<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:39.079> looking<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.430> this

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
then it should end up looking like this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
then it should end up looking like this
so<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> triangle<00:00:43.980> right<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> then

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so to be a triangle right now and then

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.520 
so to be a triangle right now and then
so<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.289> first<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
so the first thing you have to do is

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.610 
so the first thing you have to do is
fold<00:00:49.760> this<00:00:50.760> triangle<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> half<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
fold this triangle and a half so it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520 
fold this triangle and a half so it
should<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.199> then<00:00:55.199> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
should look like this and then you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.819 
should look like this and then you
unfold<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.870> turn<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
unfold it and you turn it over to the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.970 
unfold it and you turn it over to the
white<00:00:59.309> side<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.940> whatever<00:01:00.210> side<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.510> have

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
white side or whatever side you have

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
white side or whatever side you have
that's<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.219> different<00:01:02.550> color<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.660> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that's a different color and then you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.149 
that's a different color and then you
fold<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.100> edges<00:01:05.489> right<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.560> into<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
fold the edges right here into like a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
fold the edges right here into like a
little<00:01:08.369> triangle<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> should<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.659> half

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
little triangle so it should be half

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
little triangle so it should be half
diamond<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
diamond right now and then you do it the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.649 
diamond right now and then you do it the
same<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.350> side<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> she<00:01:15.299> look

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
same thing to the other side so she look

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.280 
same thing to the other side so she look
like<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.200> far<00:01:17.000> okay<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.960> after

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
like this so far okay and then after

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.120 
like this so far okay and then after
that<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:20.009> must<00:01:20.909> fold<00:01:21.479> where<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> flaps<00:01:22.830> are

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that you must fold where the flaps are

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.050 
that you must fold where the flaps are
fold<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.150> half<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.759> should

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
fold it in half like this so you should

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
fold it in half like this so you should
still<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.780> flap<00:01:27.990> sticking<00:01:28.409> out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
still it's a little flap sticking out

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.929 
still it's a little flap sticking out
and<00:01:29.299> then<00:01:30.530> for<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.710> part<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.790> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and then for this part you can do it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
and then for this part you can do it
like<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.990> could<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.290> facing<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.159> way

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
like any way it could be facing this way

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.749 
like any way it could be facing this way
on<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.240> left<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:37.380> left<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.250> way<00:01:38.520> on

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
on the left on my left or this way on

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
on the left on my left or this way on
your<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.780> doesn't<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.200> matter<00:01:40.409> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
your right it doesn't really matter but

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.440 
your right it doesn't really matter but
you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.140> fold<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.799> bottom

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you can but you have to fold the bottom

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.499 
you can but you have to fold the bottom
right<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.369> either<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:48.270> wait

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
right here like this either just wait

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.590 
right here like this either just wait
either<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.430> mean<00:01:50.790> either<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.329> way

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
either this way I mean either this way

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.420 
either this way I mean either this way
or<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.110> click<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.369> front<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.390> backwards

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
or that way click the front of backwards

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.749 
or that way click the front of backwards
so<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.460> should<00:01:56.820> look<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.729> then<00:01:59.729> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
so it should look like this and then you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.889 
so it should look like this and then you
turn<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.829> like<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.479> open

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
turn it over like this and then you open

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.880 
turn it over like this and then you open
it<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:08.179> then<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it up like that and then you see it's a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
it up like that and then you see it's a
little<00:02:10.920> pointy<00:02:11.489> part<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
little pointy part like this

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.839 
little pointy part like this
that<00:02:14.090> looks<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.720> right<00:02:14.840> now<00:02:15.050> yeah<00:02:15.950> you

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
that looks like that right now yeah you

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.809 
that looks like that right now yeah you
fold<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.900> down<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.430> should<00:02:19.700> look

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
fold it down like this so it should look

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.390 
fold it down like this so it should look
like<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:20.060> diamond<00:02:23.530> see<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.860> look<00:02:25.129> like<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
like a diamond see so you look like a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.780 
like a diamond see so you look like a
diamond<00:02:25.580> right<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.890> then<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.280> make<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
diamond right now and then to make the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.770 
diamond right now and then to make the
face<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.480> must<00:02:29.690> fold<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:31.610> into<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.420> little

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
face you must fold this into a little

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.050 
face you must fold this into a little
triangle<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:36.670> yeah<00:02:38.379> like<00:02:39.379> this<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.069> then

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
triangle like yeah like this and then

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.050 
triangle like yeah like this and then
you<00:02:41.530> put<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.560> tippity<00:02:43.250> top<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> triangle

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you put the tippity top of the triangle

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.729 
you put the tippity top of the triangle
right<00:02:44.390> there<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.049> then<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.069> fold<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.700> down

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.330 

and<00:02:51.739> then<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.060> make<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.299> little<00:02:53.630> triangle<00:02:53.870> nose

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
and then you make a little triangle nose

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.490 
and then you make a little triangle nose
SI<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.079> then<00:02:57.129> after<00:02:58.129> that<00:02:58.160> after<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.260> make

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
SI and then after that after you make

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.910 
SI and then after that after you make
the<00:03:00.530> nose<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.340> mouth<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.840> get<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.680> feet

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
the nose and the mouth you get the feet

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.170 
the nose and the mouth you get the feet
right<00:03:04.220> here<00:03:04.849> at<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.569> bottom<00:03:05.750> see<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.180> then

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
right here at the bottom see and then

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.289 
right here at the bottom see and then
you<00:03:08.209> fold<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:09.019> like<00:03:09.049> this<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.150> do

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
you fold it up like this and then you do

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.210 
you fold it up like this and then you do
it<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.629> other<00:03:14.660> side<00:03:14.870> too<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.040> should<00:03:16.190> be

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
it to the other side too so it should be

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.069 
it to the other side too so it should be
like<00:03:16.489> tiny<00:03:16.850> little<00:03:17.000> triangles<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.840> doesn't

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
like tiny little triangles it doesn't

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.740 
like tiny little triangles it doesn't
have<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:18.319> engine<00:03:19.180> but<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.480> just<00:03:20.690> looks

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
have to be engine but it just looks

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.340 
have to be engine but it just looks
better<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:21.170> way<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:22.480> then<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.930> make<00:03:24.079> the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
better that way and then to make the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.319 
better that way and then to make the
tail<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.920> must<00:03:25.450> since<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:27.730> must<00:03:28.730> fold<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.209> like

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
tail you must since I must fold it like

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.360 
tail you must since I must fold it like
this<00:03:29.389> and<00:03:32.290> then<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.319> must<00:03:33.560> fold<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.920> back<00:03:34.130> out

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
this and then you must fold it back out

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.059 
this and then you must fold it back out
like<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.940> see<00:03:38.269> this<00:03:38.450> edge<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:39.590> fold

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
like that so so see this edge you fold

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.699 
like that so so see this edge you fold
it<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:44.319> so<00:03:45.319> what<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.530> look<00:03:45.680> like

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
it in like that so what you look like

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.479 
it in like that so what you look like
this<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> back<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:47.290> then<00:03:48.290> up<00:03:48.739> front<00:03:49.190> it

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
this in the back and then up front it

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.860 
this in the back and then up front it
look<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:50.349> don't<00:03:51.349> look<00:03:51.470> like<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:52.540> okay<00:03:53.540> and

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
look like don't look like this okay and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.500 
look like don't look like this okay and
then<00:03:54.769> after<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.639> must<00:03:55.849> fold<00:03:56.150> down<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
then after that you must fold down the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.170 
then after that you must fold down the
little<00:03:57.079> fox<00:03:57.889> ears<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.459> looks<00:03:58.700> like<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:59.060> right

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
little fox ears that looks like it right

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.000 
little fox ears that looks like it right
now<00:03:59.269> just<00:04:00.049> hold<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.530> down<00:04:00.799> like<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.549> and<00:04:03.010> then

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
now just hold it down like this and then

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.520 
now just hold it down like this and then
you<00:04:04.040> do<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.549> other<00:04:04.579> year<00:04:04.880> too<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:06.200> so

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
you do it to the other year too so so

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.190 
you do it to the other year too so so
far<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.919> looks<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.819> then<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.660> bend

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
far it looks like this and then you bend

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.270 
far it looks like this and then you bend
old<00:04:10.010> tops<00:04:10.340> right<00:04:10.669> here<00:04:11.000> down<00:04:11.840> like<00:04:12.590> until<00:04:13.250> a

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
old tops right here down like until a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.750 
old tops right here down like until a
little<00:04:13.430> triangle<00:04:13.819> inside<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.299> back<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:16.519> then

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
little triangle inside the back and then

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.900 
little triangle inside the back and then
Joe<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.150> other<00:04:17.329> side<00:04:17.570> too<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.760> look

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
Joe to the other side too so to look

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.420 
Joe to the other side too so to look
like<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.239> in<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.539> back<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:23.530> then<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:25.280> have

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
like this in the back and then you have

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.110 
like this in the back and then you have
a<00:04:25.550> little
