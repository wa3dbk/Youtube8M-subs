00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:53.820
 life kept me always at peace 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.820
 you came to open the doors of pain 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:07.340
 to give me solitude 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:13.670

 complete darkness either instead of 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.670
 forget you 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.700

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:20.640
 the light and the moment I saw you 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.200

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 I looked at you again and I understood I gave you 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.250
 I say it would go with you that would go 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:43.830
 with you to the end and now that you're 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:54.060
 here you can not stay there watching me 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:59.390
 suffer as it is done to warn you and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.390
 delete your name from you

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.380
 risk of exploring the divinity not 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:22.470
