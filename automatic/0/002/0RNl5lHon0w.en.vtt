00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 welcome back and friends of Parma knows in the 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.880
 antonelli memorial third game between 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.370
 Parma and Perugia after the first victory 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.859
 encounter in the crusaders 1 to 0 on the Livorno 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 with goals from amauri won the livorno 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.580
 same against the perugia go up with 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050
 djamel mesbah one of the most positive in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 last good shooting area outlets the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 central conclusion of the parade of 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 goalkeeper on nicola sansone's shot who 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 shows as always to see the door 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
 at the tenth minute of play the first 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 conclusion yet the parma that can 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.899
 go with palladino palladino can 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.930
 aim the palladino man brings the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.000
 ball on the left but still wants 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 by raffaele palladino but what it costs 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.070
 making this period unleashed more 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.480
 warm than ever 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.789
 palladino great goal from palladino 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.879
 tactical order of the perugia but alberto 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.340
 roughly it seems to me there also a 3 5 2 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 munari munari diagonal munari 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.149
 poisonous ball that ends out of sin 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 however with the possibility given that the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.650
 narrow margin mesbah cross zone is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 good set back the plate in parades 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.140
 cover and in between strong 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 second post shot at the sparse stop and the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.630
 turn benaluane the ball stays there 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 parade covers things that says no 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.570
 still the parma however still the parma in 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.159
 offensive phase with the benaluane that yes 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.030
 puts a special worthy of the best 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.960
 shore we need to pull we have available 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.899
 conclusion of the high ball header 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.799
 sin palm still close to the goal of 10 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.509
 goal of the usual palladino the hottest 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.119
 of the summer crossed good real ball 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.210

 stefano kakà still okaka and palladino 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 not bad as a couple but the comes 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.539
 time of choices clearly though 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.399
 all the players have again 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.039

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.720
 ball number in and somehow there

 save in some way we save ourselves 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.729
 but once again closes the pincer 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.619
