00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello hello with you alexey and channel 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.090
 Bono 5 cupcakes cook this time 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.969
 american cupcakes which are called 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 muffins i will make them with chocolate 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.210
 slices and raisins 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:25.740
 baking powder and a pinch of salt 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:27.970
 mix together butter and sugar 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.910
 I grind to homogeneity 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.039
 to make everything well , you need oil 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.480
 use softened that is 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.590
 which stood at room 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.590
 temperature and an hour and a half 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.150
 add egg 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:51.480
 stir the whole mass 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:56.370
 homogeneous milk now that's fine 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
 I pour flour continue kneading dough 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 should be elastic pulled than 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 fairly uniform without lumps 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.049
 I'm making chocolate chip muffin and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.940
 raisin 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.490
 but this is not a rule at all possible 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.799
 use also candied nuts and berries 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.560
 or mix these fillers 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.320
 The main thing that I like to use here 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 such paper cups 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 it's just for convenience you can principle 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.110
 do without them 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.270
 filling them with dough but with this calculation 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.570
 that when baking a machine significantly 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.659
 increase so if you want big 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 mushroom caps fill the molds almost 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.869
 flush 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.650
 now send in preheated to 200 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.150
 degrees oven and bake 15 minutes well 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.910
 Well friends remain to enjoy 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.090
 tasting air muffins for example with 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.400
 a cup of tea or hot chocolate, I also 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.820
 I wish you good mood and soon 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.820
 I'll see you
