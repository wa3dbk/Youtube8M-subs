00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
you a little bit more points just to

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.010 
you a little bit more points just to
finish<00:01:16.070> up<00:01:16.280> your<00:01:16.430> run<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.909> when<00:01:17.720> you're<00:01:17.840> about

to<00:01:18.079> restart<00:01:18.560> or<00:01:18.649> whatever<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.189> I<00:01:19.220> just<00:01:19.520> see

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
to restart or whatever so I just see

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.980 
to restart or whatever so I just see
like<00:01:19.640> right<00:01:19.909> here<00:01:20.090> he<00:01:20.240> reverts<00:01:20.540> again<00:01:20.810> and

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
like right here he reverts again and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.469 
like right here he reverts again and
basically<00:01:21.439> research<00:01:22.009> his<00:01:22.189> whole<00:01:22.340> run<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.119> he's

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
basically research his whole run so he's

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.389 
basically research his whole run so he's
popped<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.049> tray<00:01:24.259> alright<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
popped in on the tray alright so the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.530 
popped in on the tray alright so the
second<00:01:25.729> step<00:01:25.969> that<00:01:26.060> you're<00:01:26.149> gonna<00:01:26.299> want<00:01:26.479> to

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
second step that you're gonna want to

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.120 
second step that you're gonna want to
know<00:01:26.570> keep<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.049> back<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.320> your<00:01:27.439> head<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.829> when

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
know keep the back of your head is when

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.260 
know keep the back of your head is when

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
you have when you do have a good amount

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.990 
you have when you do have a good amount
of<00:01:29.540> speed<00:01:29.719> do<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> nollie<00:01:30.590> 260<00:01:31.159> inward<00:01:31.490> heel<00:01:31.759> and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
of speed do a nollie 260 inward heel and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.520

if<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:32.479> don't<00:01:32.659> have<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> good<00:01:32.990> enough<00:01:33.170> speed<00:01:33.409> if

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
if you don't have a good enough speed if

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.990 
if you don't have a good enough speed if
you<00:01:33.560> do<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.009> is<00:01:34.159> then<00:01:34.250> mess<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.610> up<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.939> you

so make sure you have a good enough
speed<00:01:38.360> when<00:01:38.540> you're<00:01:38.659> doing<00:01:38.899> this<00:01:39.049> just<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
speed when you're doing this just to

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.139 
speed when you're doing this just to
keep<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.100> going<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.549> will<00:01:40.700> get<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.909> lot

keep it going and you will get a lot
more<00:01:41.180> points<00:01:41.780> than<00:01:42.200> an<00:01:42.320> ollie<00:01:42.469> tray<00:01:42.799> if<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.250> do

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
more points than an ollie tray if you do

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.429 
more points than an ollie tray if you do
do<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:43.939> alright<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.600> just<00:01:44.840> keep<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:45.110> back

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
do this alright so just keep that back

do this alright so just keep that back
of<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.710> head<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.070> if<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:46.250> messed<00:01:46.430> up<00:01:46.610> it's

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
of your head and if you messed up it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.389 
of your head and if you messed up it's
going<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.360> mess<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.689> up<00:01:47.750> really<00:01:48.259> bad<00:01:48.439> and<00:01:48.680> you

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
going to mess you up really bad and you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.039 
going to mess you up really bad and you
just<00:01:49.670> can<00:01:49.820> get<00:01:49.939> really<00:01:50.119> mad<00:01:50.329> in<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:50.750> rage

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
just can get really mad in this rage

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.080 
just can get really mad in this rage
because<00:01:51.320> some<00:01:51.560> people<00:01:51.829> could<00:01:52.610> have<00:01:52.700> got<00:01:52.820> like

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
because some people could have got like

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.730 
because some people could have got like
high<00:01:53.270> scores<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.810> they<00:01:53.869> messed<00:01:54.049> up<00:01:54.259> by<00:01:54.469> doing

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
high scores and they messed up by doing

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.740 
high scores and they messed up by doing
this<00:01:54.829> trick<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:55.579> anyways<00:01:55.969> on<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.359> last<00:01:56.509> one

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
this trick but anyways on the last one

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.420 
this trick but anyways on the last one
is<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:57.109> simply<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.009> need<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.219> know<00:01:58.280> how<00:01:58.369> to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
is just simply you need to know how to

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.219 
is just simply you need to know how to
triple<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.939> Blanco<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.509> that's<00:01:59.659> simply<00:01:59.990> doing

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
triple to Blanco so that's simply doing

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.099 
triple to Blanco so that's simply doing
a<00:02:00.500> nollie<00:02:01.189> tre<00:02:01.579> into<00:02:01.969> a<00:02:02.000> nollie<00:02:02.240> 360<00:02:02.479> inward

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
heel into a nollie heart a nollie 360

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.929 
heel into a nollie heart a nollie 360
hard<00:02:06.350> alright<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.250> once<00:02:07.429> you<00:02:07.520> do<00:02:07.640> all<00:02:07.820> those
