00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
and then the third and final progression

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.670 
and then the third and final progression
there<00:01:30.830> is<00:01:31.100> we're<00:01:31.550> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.790> hop<00:01:32.120> forward<00:01:32.680> so

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
and then we're actually going to bound

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.700 
and then we're actually going to bound
forward<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:40.370> catch<00:01:40.670> ourselves<00:01:41.200> five<00:01:42.200> seconds

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
forward and catch ourselves five seconds

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.790
