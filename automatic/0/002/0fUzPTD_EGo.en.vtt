00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.130
 hi to all you are with planet gt 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.720
 we are in Portugal and for 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.929
 start the year 2015 we try the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.170
 peugeot 308 gt2 version left the block 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.420
 thp of 205 horses and the blog blue hdi 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 180 horses with this tea box 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 automatic left now starts 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.930
 and will end when I decide them 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.279
 it's gone it's under a beautiful sky 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 Portuguese that we left 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 discover the peugeot 308 gti peugeot which 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.310
 is really back in the race 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 continues to expand its new range and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.420
 the 308 starts at that will be 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 seriously and without leading 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 remains to be seen if the result is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
 pleasant and 10 of those I was 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.129
 answer now that is appreciable 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.110
 on this 308 was there is that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 aesthetically peugeot did the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.219
 small retouches that go very very 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.719
 well at 308 because already I you 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 reminds that on the first version 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.670
 sedan we had really enjoyed the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 style 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.039
 here we have a version that is even more 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.960
 sporty for the 308 gtl and slightly 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.640
 lowered so that gives him another 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.039
 better seat we have a style that is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.379
 more worked with some kind of skirts 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.540
 side bumper front and rear 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.549
 which is slightly redesigned we have this 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.310
 fake diffuser with a double outlet 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.409
 escape the fact of having replaced the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.690
 Peugeot logo in the center of the grille 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.890
 it was really a necessity 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.720
 besides, we realized with the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 blogger friends that if we had a festive 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 on the 308 should he approach the one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 from the 508 and that allow to have a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 face man even more aggressive here 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.800
 they may have been a little too early 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.380
 it lacks a bit of aggression and 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.820
 when the 308 offer that I think we 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.830
 will really get close to the car 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.900
 perfect and one of the most beautiful cars 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.740
 French version 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.950
 sedan or break in terms of sensations 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.630
 inside peugeot obviously put 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.550
 the best finishes on the 308 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.440
 I was since it's becoming more or 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.860
 less the upscale finish and so 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.480
 we have a leather or alcantara interior that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 is really nice and in which we 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.660
 feel good we are in a car very 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.430
 well finished I too much and I think that's 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.640
 what we needed for a car 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.260
 French type and sporty gt a 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.580
 car that we can really use 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.440
 every day and with two 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.630
 behaviors through the flirty 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.240
 sport pack two engines are 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.310
 proposed tea 205 hp in box 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 manual and blu hdi 180 horses 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.410
 associated with the automatic gearbox LATecis and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.850
 308 gti wanting to be versatile driver 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.200
 sportback will allow you to exacerbate 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.879
 his sporty side when you leave 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.040
 I will not lie to you and between the 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.379
 version 2 105 horses and the blu version 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.459
 hdi the one who surprised me the most 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.370
 the little time I had for 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.890
 drive is the blu hdi version that 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.300
 for the blow really has behaviors 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.980
 very different ie when 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.050
 you drive in a normal way you 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.580
 will be enough on a car pretty much 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.459
 everyday with a diesel engine 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.900
 relatively unobtrusive except obviously if 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.000
 you start typing in the towers 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.769
 but as soon as you put the driver mode 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.480
 sportback in place it's really 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.290
 impressive to see the ability of the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.750
 car has changed 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.060
 and concretely even if it's fake 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.500
 are we have the impression of having a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.500
 car that is getting closer to a v8 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.190
 and in terms of feelings of feeling if 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.410
 you are not the purist type who has 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.980
 need to have a real engine that makes 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.350
 noise 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.700
 if one day you just want to 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.170
 to please on a small road 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 very honestly the sportback driver 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.520
 it's the right option because when 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 you will be before driving you city 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.730
 can simply drive without 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.160
 want to push but as soon as you 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.590
 activate the option there you are in mode 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.340
 sport clearly and it makes you want to 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.340
 push to roll hard 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.420
 version thp 200 5 a plus it's seen 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.340
 blame behavior as much as possible 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.960
 sporty with more performances 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.670
 important and its manual gearbox more 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.410
 suitable for a very dense driving port 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.090
 however, it requires more 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.380
 solicitations to take full advantage 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.350
 of what she has in general 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.870
 this 308 gti is pleasant will find his 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.990
 customer is obviously on the basis of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.630
 what we could see there we expect a 308 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.870
 gti or even a 308 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.410
 r one wants to upset and starts 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.790
 get there 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.380
 hello showed us they were 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.019
 able to do it with the air rcz 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.160
 with the 208 gti 30th birthday and he 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.880
 are really very good things to 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.890
 take 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.720
 it's a car that's relatively 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.910
 appreciable and that makes you want in fact 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.470
 to have even more I think it's 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.850
 a good introduction for the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.100
 who wants to have a car 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.380
 with a character for every day in 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.500
 waiting to be able to afford either a 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.090
 sedan 308 is rejected and we'll see but 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.940
 very honestly there are some good 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.169
 things I think we can not say that 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.330
 this car is bad 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.350
 especially that trance or 308 was good 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.510
 at the base so it was relatively 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.130
 difficult when we get into a 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.130
 sports version to do less 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.960
 I hope to have told you everything if not 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.600
 obviously you have the right to say 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.040
 the full test you can go on the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.540
 planet site gt you have exact rate 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.870
 also the right to subscribe as 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.190
 usually if you have questions 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.840
 you ask them in my comments 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.790
 for the rest I kiss you and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.190
 tell you more it's time to leave 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.780
 the Portuguese hi everyone has in mind in 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.840
 planet company gt we are at 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.380
 Portugal to start I started 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.380
 as
