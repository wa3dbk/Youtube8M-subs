00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
Manor in 2011 we did follow the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
Manor in 2011 we did follow the
construction<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.619> was

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
construction of that and it was it was

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.589 
construction of that and it was it was
good<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.160> watch<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:26.970> opened<00:00:27.510> in

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
good to watch you know it was opened in

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.509 
good to watch you know it was opened in
the<00:00:27.630> summer<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.740> managed<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the summer and so managed to see it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.429 
the summer and so managed to see it
being<00:00:29.699> built<00:00:29.939> throughout<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> early<00:00:30.599> season

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
being built throughout the early season

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.100 
being built throughout the early season
and<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> steel<00:00:32.730> family<00:00:33.600> boomerang

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
and so it's a steel family boomerang

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
and so it's a steel family boomerang
roller<00:00:34.350> coaster<00:00:34.920> first<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.670> its<00:00:35.790> time<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
roller coaster first of its time to be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.619 
roller coaster first of its time to be
built<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.340> since<00:00:38.340> sold<00:00:38.640> many<00:00:39.120> more<00:00:39.329> than<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
built and since sold many more than that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.260 
built and since sold many more than that
and<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.680> did<00:00:40.829> announce<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.550> first

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and then they did announce the first

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
and then they did announce the first
they<00:00:42.450> announced<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> ride<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> December<00:00:43.680> 2010

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
they announced the ride in December 2010

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
they announced the ride in December 2010
and<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> prototype<00:00:45.989> steel<00:00:46.559> family

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and so it's the prototype steel family

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.330 
and so it's the prototype steel family
boomerang<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> ride<00:00:49.590> features<00:00:49.800> one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
boomerang and the ride features one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
boomerang and the ride features one
vertical<00:00:50.730> left<00:00:50.879> tail<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> that's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
vertical left tail just there and that's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
vertical left tail just there and that's
driven<00:00:52.649> by<00:00:53.090> normal<00:00:54.090> wheels<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.629> release<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
driven by normal wheels that release the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.979 
driven by normal wheels that release the
train<00:00:55.289> onto<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> curving<00:00:56.340> figure<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> eight

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
train onto the curving figure of eight

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
train onto the curving figure of eight
as<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.289> by<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> footage<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
as you can see by the footage there and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.040 
as you can see by the footage there and
it<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> more<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.180> less<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.539> figure<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> eight

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it is more or less a figure of eight

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
it is more or less a figure of eight
lots<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> helixes<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.760> you've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.000> like

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
lots of helixes and then you've got like

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
lots of helixes and then you've got like
there<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> bump<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> top<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.470> there

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
there the bump up to the top just there

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490 
there the bump up to the top just there
and<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.750> good<00:01:06.930> layout<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.260> do

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and it's got it's got a good layout I do

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
and it's got it's got a good layout I do
like<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> tower<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> home<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
like the tower there and with the home I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
like the tower there and with the home I
think<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.380> addition<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
think it's a really nice addition to the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
think it's a really nice addition to the
ride<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> audio<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.020> well

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
ride and with the audio there as well

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
ride and with the audio there as well
and<00:01:13.530> sort<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> replacing<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> normal

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and sort of replacing the normal

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
and sort of replacing the normal
corkscrews<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.020> boom<00:01:16.320> round<00:01:16.530> coaster

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
corkscrews and the boom round coaster

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
corkscrews and the boom round coaster
would<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> comes<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:18.900> down

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
would have and then it comes back down

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
would have and then it comes back down
backwards<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.070> follows<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> way

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
backwards and follows it all the way

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
backwards and follows it all the way
around<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> circuit<00:01:22.290> climbs<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> bottom

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
around the circuit climbs the bottom

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
around the circuit climbs the bottom
part<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> list<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> again<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.960> back

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
part of the list it again and then back

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
part of the list it again and then back
in<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> say<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.310> pretty<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:26.729> popular<00:01:27.240> with

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
in and say it's pretty very popular with

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.899 
in and say it's pretty very popular with
the<00:01:27.689> family<00:01:28.170> market<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.400> komamura<00:01:29.670> sold

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the family market and for komamura sold

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
the family market and for komamura sold
I<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.110> three<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> these<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.860> could<00:01:31.979> be

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I think three more of these it could be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
I think three more of these it could be
more<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.630> far<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:35.100> they

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
more but that's all off so far and they

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
more but that's all off so far and they
look<00:01:35.369> great<00:01:35.579> they've<00:01:35.820> sold<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.150> identical<00:01:36.720> one

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
look great they've sold an identical one

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.819 
look great they've sold an identical one
to<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.409> there's<00:01:37.590> another<00:01:37.650> one
