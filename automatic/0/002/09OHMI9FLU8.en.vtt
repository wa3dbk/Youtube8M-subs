00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.280
 population titles includes 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 several concepts it is important to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.179
 distinguish from the very beginning first thing 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.590
 population so not by definition 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.230
 it's a set of individuals of the same 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.279
 species that occupies a given space to a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 exact moment 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.150
 so if we decorate is exercising that is good 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.630
 important to remember is that the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 population it is individuals of a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 same species that will occupy what we 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.800
 also calls a territory 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 so finally when we talked about 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 space often gave it's very 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 restricted eyes of limitations so if we 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 take for example an island so that's 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 delimited by the water so that's a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.570
 territory and at a specific moment 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.440
 a bit like I was taking a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 photograph of the population and that I 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.719
 calculated that I read everything said to this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 precise moment at the level of the attacked 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.750
 it's pretty simple actually it's the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.170
 number directly from individuals who 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.880
 make up the population and finally the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 density ben is the number of individuals 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.500
 So in other words it is the size and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.869
 will divide this number of individuals by one 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.479
 surface unit 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.030
 often we will use for example 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.979
 square kilometers where the square meter 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.070
 so we're really going to focus on 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 population density and we will do 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.200
 an example of calculating tons in this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.869
 time so here I would like to know the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.759
 density of the frog population 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.740
 is in time so to do this 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.409
 i need two things i'm going to have 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.990
 need the number of individuals from the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.869
 population so ultimately the size I 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.659
 will also have the surface that is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.079
 occupied therefore the area of ​​the territory 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.610
 therefore occupies the area or area 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.140
 it's pretty simple it has already been 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.939
 calculated often they will be given 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.160
 where she is going to be very easy to calculate 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.800
 so in the case here of the example the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.870
 area of the pond is 1.3 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.500
 square kilometer so we will be able 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.120
 reuse 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.800
 just now in our equation 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 now in terms of the number 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.620
 of individuals in reality the size of 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.470
 the population is often calculated from 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 different ways among others because 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.540
 which is called the technique with 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.930
 plots 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.940
 so if you want more information about 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.130
 these methods there you can go see the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.440
 sheet the study of populations in the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.630
 virtual library of allo prof us 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.850
 here it's pretty easy we'll all 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.640
 just count the number of 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.150
 frogs that are on time 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.820
 now it has 32, therefore making 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.220
 that I can simply to them 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.110
 fill 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:02.880
 so here the number of individuals 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:05.940
 I have 30 2 and I'm going to divide his pair 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.690
 the occupied area which was 1.3 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.180
 square kilometer that's when I take 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.700
 my calculator and that I'm doing this calculation 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.200
 there I end up with 24,62 I'm going 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.019
 create such a below 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.260
 frogs per square kilometer 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.590
 so that's always going to give this guy 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.440
 of units there we could also have 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:40.380
 as a general unit if we want that 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:43.470
 could be individuals per kilometer 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.780
 square or other surface unit 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.730
 busy so that's it's this way 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.680
 where you see how to calculate the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.019
 density of a population always makes 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.820
 be careful to keep the same species 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.829
 so when we calculate if we mix 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.010
 two species together does well the 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.010
 distinction
