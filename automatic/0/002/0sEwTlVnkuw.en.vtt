00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.300 
final with us doing so well and you know
with<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.760> league<00:02:29.060> being<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.069> you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
with the league being a little bit you

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.369 
with the league being a little bit you
know<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.730> bottom<00:02:32.629> where<00:02:32.750> teams<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.290> know

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
know the bottom where teams you know

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.720 
know the bottom where teams you know
what<00:02:33.620> didn't<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.129> as<00:02:34.310> well<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.549> they<00:02:34.670> could

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
what didn't do as well as they could

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.020 
what didn't do as well as they could
obviously<00:02:35.540> but<00:02:36.409> with<00:02:36.560> six<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.519> up<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:38.000> know

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
obviously but with six that up you know

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.089 
obviously but with six that up you know
it<00:02:38.150> was<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.269> pretty<00:02:38.540> tight<00:02:38.840> League<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:39.859> think

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
it was a pretty tight League and I think

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.360 
it was a pretty tight League and I think
they'll<00:02:40.280> leave<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.849> fry<00:02:41.150> has<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.109> have<00:02:42.260> all<00:02:42.650> ten

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
they'll leave to fry has to have all ten

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.129 
they'll leave to fry has to have all ten
teams<00:02:44.980> close<00:02:46.150> any<00:02:47.150> team<00:02:47.389> to<00:02:47.540> be<00:02:47.629> data<00:02:47.810> team<00:02:48.019> at

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
teams close any team to be data team at

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.599 
teams close any team to be data team at
any<00:02:48.230> time<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.799> starting<00:02:49.159> to<00:02:49.280> get<00:02:49.400> that

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
any time and it's starting to get that

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.110 
any time and it's starting to get that
way<00:02:49.819> but<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:50.780> once<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.319> know<00:02:51.859> that's<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
way but I think once you know that's the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.330 
way but I think once you know that's the
teams<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.840> don't<00:02:54.019> necessarily<00:02:54.859> make<00:02:54.980> all

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
teams that don't necessarily make all

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.020 
teams that don't necessarily make all
the<00:02:55.639> money<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.799> everything<00:02:57.799> once<00:02:58.579> they<00:02:58.790> can

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
the money and everything once they can

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.179 
the money and everything once they can
you<00:02:59.389> know<00:02:59.480> get<00:02:59.719> get<00:02:59.959> over<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.409> and<00:03:00.769> start

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
you know get get over that and start

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.679 
you know get get over that and start
winning<00:03:01.310> some<00:03:01.459> games<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:02.000> all<00:03:02.239> doing<00:03:02.540> what

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
winning some games and all doing what

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.839

I've played in a long time to try to to
win<00:03:45.920> them<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:47.120> they<00:03:47.270> play<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.840> even

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
win them if they play like that even

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.070 
win them if they play like that even
half<00:03:48.230> as<00:03:48.470> good<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:49.489> their<00:03:49.730> online

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
half as good as that in their online

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.330 
half as good as that in their online
with<00:03:51.080> their<00:03:51.260> fans<00:03:51.590> with<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.920> amount<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:52.160> fans

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
with their fans with the amount of fans

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.699 
with their fans with the amount of fans
they<00:03:52.519> got<00:03:52.730> there<00:03:52.940> especially<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:53.900> think

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
they got there especially I think

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.440 
they got there especially I think
they're<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.920> favorites<00:03:55.370> but<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.269> one

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
they're the favorites but it's a one

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.900 
they're the favorites but it's a one
game<00:03:56.630> it's<00:03:57.320> one<00:03:57.500> game<00:03:57.680> each<00:03:57.739> so<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.489> never

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
game it's one game each so you never

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.880 
game it's one game each so you never
know<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.420> last<00:03:59.630> year<00:03:59.989> there<00:04:00.290> are<00:04:00.380> four<00:04:00.620> seed

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
know like last year there are four seed

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.680 
know like last year there are four seed
