com<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.430> this<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.940> throttle<00:00:06.720> body<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
com and this is the throttle body of the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.370 
com and this is the throttle body of the
passenger<00:00:07.770> side<00:00:07.980> for<00:00:08.220> John<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:09.380> California

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
passenger side for John in California

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.990 
passenger side for John in California
now<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.969> motor<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:13.110> originally<00:00:14.000> inside

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
now the motor that was originally inside

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.260 
now the motor that was originally inside
the<00:00:15.150> throttle<00:00:15.509> body<00:00:15.949> is<00:00:16.949> making<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.430> bearing

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the throttle body is making a bearing

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:33.799 
the throttle body is making a bearing
noise<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.039> hear<00:00:30.949> not<00:00:31.949> good<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
noise so you can hear not good and it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
noise so you can hear not good and it
was<00:00:33.930> also<00:00:34.110> slower<00:00:34.620> than<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> replacement

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
was also slower than the replacement

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
was also slower than the replacement
motor<00:00:36.180> here's<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> replacement<00:00:37.770> motor<00:00:40.129> no

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
motor here's the replacement motor no

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.319 
motor here's the replacement motor no
noise<00:00:42.379> now<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> spin<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:45.149> by

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
noise now I'm going to spin them one by

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:56.120 
noise now I'm going to spin them one by
one<00:00:45.710> just<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> compare<00:00:48.620> oops<00:00:50.180> okay

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.180 

so<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.820> hear<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> motor<00:00:57.360> spin<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so you can hear the motor spin and get a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:11.890 
so you can hear the motor spin and get a
noise<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.730> there

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.429 

the<00:01:12.900> front<00:01:13.200> bearing

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.440 

and<00:01:20.439> notice<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.490> speed<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.240> little

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and notice the speed it's a little

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.999 
and notice the speed it's a little
slower<00:01:24.990> there's<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.109> little<00:01:26.350> vibration<00:01:26.890> in

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
slower there's a little vibration in

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:38.850 
slower there's a little vibration in
there<00:01:27.159> too<00:01:34.020> let's<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.319> reverse

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.340 

city<00:01:39.580> vs<00:01:39.970> ok<00:01:41.940> it's<00:01:42.940> just<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.270> forward<00:01:43.720> oh<00:01:46.350> there

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
city vs ok it's just a forward oh there

00:01:47.350 --> 00:02:00.710 
city vs ok it's just a forward oh there
you<00:01:47.410> go<00:01:51.420> yeah<00:01:52.420> that's<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.320> bank<00:01:53.530> noise

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.350 

literally<00:02:01.620> hear<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
literally hear that and this is the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.219 
literally hear that and this is the
replacement<00:02:03.630> motor<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.650> an<00:02:04.740> air<00:02:04.980> already

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.140 

this<00:02:10.229> one's<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:11.150> faster<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> notice

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
this one's good faster see the notice

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.170 
this one's good faster see the notice
the<00:02:15.360> speed<00:02:16.200> difference

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.479 

shake<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> little<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.310> tested<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.340> before

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
shake it a little bit I tested it before

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.330 
shake it a little bit I tested it before
but<00:02:26.989> this<00:02:27.989> one

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:47.640 

just<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.180> slowing<00:02:35.599> down<00:02:35.900> kind<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:42.160> yeah

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.130 

so<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.219> motor<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.609> not<00:02:49.939> good<00:02:50.239> I'm<00:02:50.810> going<00:02:51.019> to

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
so this motor is not good I'm going to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.819 
so this motor is not good I'm going to
put<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.500> gear<00:02:51.680> back<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:53.109> open<00:02:54.109> and<00:02:54.590> closed

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
put the gear back on and open and closed

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.310 
put the gear back on and open and closed
throttle<00:02:55.489> body<00:02:56.290> with<00:02:57.290> replacement<00:02:58.099> motor
