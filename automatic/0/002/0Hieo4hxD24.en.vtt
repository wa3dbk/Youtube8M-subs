they disappeared down again behind there
and<00:02:57.540> then<00:02:58.540> quick<00:02:59.170> as<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.320> flash<00:02:59.410> I<00:03:00.130> believe<00:03:00.610> I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
and then quick as a flash I believe I

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.569

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.700 
investigations so he does we know what
to<00:04:22.910> expect<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.780> they<00:04:24.020> just<00:04:24.230> kind<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.530> went

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
to expect and they just kind of went

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.060 
to expect and they just kind of went
across<00:04:24.890> here<00:04:26.080> we<00:04:27.080> all<00:04:27.140> thought<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.650> people

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
across here we all thought that people

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.490

that way wasn't it I was like scared
it's<00:04:33.680> difficult<00:04:34.010> for<00:04:34.100> me<00:04:34.220> having<00:04:34.520> not<00:04:34.610> been

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
it's difficult for me having not been
