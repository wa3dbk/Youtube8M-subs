00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.080
 and in relation to our soy journey with 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.330
 sustainability from next Thursday 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.289
 among the companies that will return us to 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.420
 accompany will be with if the dealer 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.019
 There's where to go to the center and north of 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.210
 the province of córdoba that the other day 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:26.960
 effect a day in the facilities 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.609
 from the central house here in the cities 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 of Córdoba a day that made focus 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:37.270
 mainly in agriculture 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.750
 precision and also in drip irrigation 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.590
 buried 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.930
 within the framework of that day of things and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.410
 We interview the engineer Elena 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.410
 pereira 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.660
 good we were with a day of 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.520
 training in what has been pilot 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.580
 automatic mainly applied to the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.100
 plant where he was trying a little bit 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.230
 what are agronomic benefits and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.330
 use the planting pilot and the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.360
 economic benefits is to say put 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.119
 a number what the producer drinks in 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.130
 the field also presented some 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.660
 news is to say some technologies 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.030
 new ones that are launching yoandy 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.940
 mainly what is dosage of 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.400
 variable fertilization in solids and in 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.450
 liquids 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.070
 we have been finally launching 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.160
 location of the water drip line 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.110
 buried with a talk training 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.220
 showing a bit how the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.630
 system what are 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.250
 what is the saving what is the investment 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.070
 what you have to do and what are the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.320
 benefits of this system and also 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.990
 we've been with the dynamic part is 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.640
 say the possibility that the producer 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.920
 go up to the teams you can see how 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.900
 they work with music free what is the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 accuracy that they have and well I know a 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.100
 little more closely what you a little more 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.650
 the teams you talked about benefits or 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.050
 of numbers there is something concrete that 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.950
 can discard or valorize if that is 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.540
 just what we have been 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.540
 presenting today we have been putting 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.210
 numbers to what are the benefits of 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.380
 use pilot we talked about what 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.720
 is the side what the increase means 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 in productivity that is the amount 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.340
 of hours per day that the producer can 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.170
 work using pilot the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.120
 decrease that means in consumption 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.170
 fuel saving fuel 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.630
 the saving of supplies 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.640
 what is the overall savings that it has for 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.120
 year the producer using this type 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.849
 of machinery today has a 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.060
 financing very accessible to two or three 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.540
 years which allows the producer with 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.819
 what saves paying that fee say 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.380
 from the credit equal the truth that 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.230
 It has been a very interesting debate 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.150
 where each one presented his point of view 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.140
 and its situation the neighborhood that was was very 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.140
 rich for all
