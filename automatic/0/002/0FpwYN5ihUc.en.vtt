00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.299
 welding 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.169
 thin metal thickness of 0 8 units and 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.409
 preferably produce by 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:15.490
 automatic welding for welding 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:18.260
 it is necessary to choose welding materials 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.410
 this welding wire exists 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.650
 wire of different diameters is very 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.270
 diameter 0 6 millimeter 08 millimeter 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.390
 units and more 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.820
 Well, in our case, wire is used. 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.579
 diameter 0 8 millimeters is also very 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.969
 wire diameter 0 will work well too 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.519
 6 millimeter is also needed 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.730
 determine the choice of protective gas 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.839
 There are options for welding 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 pure carbon dioxide and options 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:55.039
 carbon dioxide / argon mixtures in proportion 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.839
 82 percent argon and 18 percent co2 in 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.850
 our case it is a mixture of 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.620
 also perfect net 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.960
 carbon dioxide welding of thin metal 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.910
 preferably doted 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 mode or interval if 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.620
 produce continuous weld this 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.110
 the metal will heat up too much 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.810
 I will tell him about the settings 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.150
 for welding thin metal on the example of 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 automatic spid and 175 marks of alur pro 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.330
 such a nuance 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.220
 welding modes 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.680
 will be significantly different from 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.240
 it depends on which protective gas we use 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.420
 if it's a gas mixture 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.760
 then the modes will be one of purely whole from 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.330
 modes will be different but in our case 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.210
 gas mixture is used and 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.520
 mode will be approximately 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.070
 means apparatus synergistically 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.159
 that is, by 1 adjustment we change and 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.790
 voltage and feed rate but for 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.670
 metal thick 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.930
 08 millimeter voltage will be 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.090
 approximately 17 18 volt speed 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.330
 filing three and two meters in personal 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.670
 every welder's wish we can 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.400
 change voltage setting 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.490
 depending on the factory factory for 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.980
 programming here will be the value 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:25.400
 minus 20 plus 20 notes for thin welding 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400
 metal 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.690
 Estimated -10 -15 should be 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.040
 stress is my personal preference and 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.580
 also exist still 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.370
 the inductance setting here is the value 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.370
 minus 10 and plus 10 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.980
 thin metal is needed as much as possible 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.420
 less heat therefore 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.830
 minus value will be a colder arc 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.840
 from here 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.360
 can tentatively set 07 08 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.870
 inductance value is also needed 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.900
 consider the gas pressure if it is a pressure reducer with 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.750
 pressure gauge pressure is necessary 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.629
 expose about 0 2 kilograms this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 two dozen kilogram and if the gear 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.060
 Stratton pressure games are needed 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.860
 install 10 to 15 liters per minute 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.860
 depending on conditions
