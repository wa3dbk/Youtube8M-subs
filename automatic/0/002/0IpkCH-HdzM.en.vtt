this<00:00:23.390> week's<00:00:23.660> question<00:00:23.930> comes<00:00:24.560> from<00:00:24.710> Kelsey

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
this week's question comes from Kelsey

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.670 
this week's question comes from Kelsey
Kelsey<00:00:25.700> writes<00:00:26.150> my<00:00:26.960> horse<00:00:27.200> and<00:00:27.380> I've<00:00:27.500> been

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
Kelsey writes my horse and I've been

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.590 
Kelsey writes my horse and I've been
practicing<00:00:28.250> with<00:00:28.280> the<00:00:28.550> barrels<00:00:28.850> lately<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:29.480> I

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
practicing with the barrels lately and I

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.240 
practicing with the barrels lately and I
was<00:00:29.750> wondering<00:00:30.260> if<00:00:30.440> her<00:00:30.590> times<00:00:30.890> would<00:00:31.130> be

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
was wondering if her times would be

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.070 
was wondering if her times would be
better<00:00:31.400> if<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:31.850> went<00:00:32.029> really<00:00:32.419> close<00:00:32.690> to<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
better if I went really close to the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.450 
better if I went really close to the
barrel<00:00:33.350> which<00:00:33.650> is<00:00:33.680> how<00:00:34.070> we've<00:00:34.280> been

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
barrel which is how we've been

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.970 
barrel which is how we've been
practicing<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.780> thing<00:00:35.960> about<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.770> then

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
practicing the thing about that is then

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.010 
practicing the thing about that is then
speed<00:00:37.400> slows<00:00:37.730> down<00:00:38.060> as<00:00:38.390> soon<00:00:38.600> as<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:38.840> get<00:00:38.960> to

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
speed slows down as soon as we get to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.780 
speed slows down as soon as we get to
the<00:00:39.200> barrel<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:39.830> was<00:00:39.950> wondering<00:00:40.190> if<00:00:40.550> I

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
the barrel so I was wondering if I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.729 
the barrel so I was wondering if I
should<00:00:41.030> work<00:00:41.180> on<00:00:41.390> curving<00:00:41.780> out<00:00:41.960> more<00:00:42.290> on<00:00:42.620> the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
should work on curving out more on the

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.799 
should work on curving out more on the
barrel<00:00:43.070> but<00:00:43.670> I'm<00:00:43.820> afraid<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.239> would<00:00:44.360> cost<00:00:44.570> us

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
barrel but I'm afraid it would cost us

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.560 
barrel but I'm afraid it would cost us
more<00:00:45.110> time<00:00:45.410> but<00:00:46.010> then<00:00:46.220> again<00:00:46.370> my<00:00:46.850> horse<00:00:47.120> can<00:00:47.420> go

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
more time but then again my horse can go

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.549 
more time but then again my horse can go
faster<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.290> wider<00:00:48.500> we<00:00:48.739> go<00:00:50.290> thanks<00:00:51.290> for<00:00:51.440> your

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
faster the wider we go thanks for your

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.130 
faster the wider we go thanks for your

question healthy there are wide and

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.500 
question healthy there are wide and
varied<00:00:54.530> opinions<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:55.340> exactly<00:00:55.940> where<00:00:56.120> over

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
varied opinions of exactly where over

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.210 
varied opinions of exactly where over
Essex<00:00:56.750> peach<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:57.260> fall<00:00:57.470> when<00:00:57.710> traveling

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
Essex peach and fall when traveling

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.550 
Essex peach and fall when traveling
around<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.580> paddock<00:00:58.790> if<00:00:59.600> we<00:00:59.840> were<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.200> study

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
around the paddock if we were to study

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.800 
around the paddock if we were to study
the<00:01:00.800> exact<00:01:01.220> footfall<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.210> world's<00:01:02.570> top

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
the exact footfall of the world's top

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.200 
the exact footfall of the world's top
horses<00:01:03.410> we'd<00:01:04.009> find<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.430> each<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.820> them<00:01:05.000> won

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
horses we'd find that each of them won

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.660 
horses we'd find that each of them won
very<00:01:05.449> slightly<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.560> although<00:01:06.710> I'm<00:01:07.070> hesitant

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
very slightly so although I'm hesitant

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.120 
very slightly so although I'm hesitant
to<00:01:07.820> describe<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.570> certain<00:01:08.960> way<00:01:09.110> as<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.560> only

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
to describe a certain way as the only

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.700 
to describe a certain way as the only
way<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:10.610> do<00:01:10.970> have<00:01:11.300> a<00:01:11.600> certain<00:01:11.930> track<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.590> I

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
way I do have a certain track that I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.859 
way I do have a certain track that I
follow<00:01:13.070> around<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.520> barrels<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.060> as<00:01:14.690> you

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
follow around the barrels and as you

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.450 
follow around the barrels and as you
determine<00:01:15.320> what<00:01:15.500> works<00:01:15.680> best<00:01:15.950> for<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.340> and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
determine what works best for you and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.310 
determine what works best for you and
your<00:01:16.640> horses<00:01:17.210> keep<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.780> mind<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.110> there<00:01:18.290> are

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
your horses keep in mind that there are

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.469 
your horses keep in mind that there are
some<00:01:18.500> basic<00:01:18.830> foundational<00:01:19.670> concepts<00:01:20.330> that

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
some basic foundational concepts that

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.660 
some basic foundational concepts that
apply<00:01:20.600> across<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.380> board<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.430> I'll<00:01:22.550> be

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
apply across the board and I'll be

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.389 
apply across the board and I'll be
sharing<00:01:22.910> all<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.509> in<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:23.930> video<00:01:24.399> to

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
sharing all of that in this video to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.370 
sharing all of that in this video to
start<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:25.880> I'll<00:01:26.119> explain<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.140> path

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
start with I'll explain that the path

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.499 
start with I'll explain that the path
you've<00:01:28.100> trained<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:28.640> horse's<00:01:29.060> feet<00:01:29.300> to

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
you've trained your horse's feet to

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.630 
you've trained your horse's feet to
follow<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.319> pattern<00:01:30.710> can<00:01:30.979> make<00:01:31.220> or<00:01:31.490> break

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
follow in the pattern can make or break

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.419 
follow in the pattern can make or break
your<00:01:31.910> run<00:01:32.229> basically<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.410> way<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:33.590> travel<00:01:34.039> to

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
your run basically the way we travel to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.490 
your run basically the way we travel to
barrel<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.060> often<00:01:35.509> how<00:01:35.660> we'll<00:01:35.869> turn<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.140> barrel

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
barrel is often how we'll turn a barrel

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.460 
barrel is often how we'll turn a barrel
and<00:01:37.250> how<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.610> enter<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> turn<00:01:38.360> determines<00:01:39.319> how

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
and how you enter a turn determines how

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.520 
and how you enter a turn determines how
you<00:01:39.530> exit<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.100> turn<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:41.330> it's<00:01:41.479> very<00:01:41.690> important

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you exit a turn so it's very important

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.070 
you exit a turn so it's very important
when<00:01:42.850> troubleshooting<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.090> look<00:01:44.270> at<00:01:44.450> what

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
when troubleshooting to look at what

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.990 
when troubleshooting to look at what
happened<00:01:45.530> before<00:01:45.709> what<00:01:46.039> happened<00:01:46.459> happened

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
happened before what happened happened

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.419 
happened before what happened happened
horses<00:01:47.840> need<00:01:48.050> enough<00:01:48.470> room<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:48.800> their<00:01:49.280> big

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
horses need enough room so their big

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.999 
horses need enough room so their big
bodies<00:01:49.880> can<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.780> turns<00:01:51.050> but<00:01:51.380> covering

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
bodies can get to the turns but covering

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.160 
bodies can get to the turns but covering
too<00:01:52.310> much<00:01:52.550> real<00:01:52.819> estate<00:01:53.179> can<00:01:53.479> create<00:01:53.899> Flora

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
too much real estate can create Flora

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.230 
too much real estate can create Flora
times<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.860> sometimes<00:01:55.250> actually<00:01:55.670> make<00:01:56.060> it

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
times and sometimes actually make it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.160 
times and sometimes actually make it
tempting<00:01:56.660> from

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
tempting from

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.770 
tempting from
to<00:01:57.500> drop<00:01:57.830> into<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.310> girl<00:01:58.549> because<00:01:59.360> there's<00:01:59.570> such

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
to drop into a girl because there's such

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.649 
to drop into a girl because there's such
a<00:01:59.810> huge<00:02:00.290> space<00:02:00.470> there<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.070> do<00:02:01.189> stuff<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.240> angle

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
a huge space there to do stuff the angle

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.420 
a huge space there to do stuff the angle
that<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.930> approach<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.470> barrel<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:03.979> how<00:02:04.220> much

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
that we approach the barrel and how much

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.429 
that we approach the barrel and how much
room<00:02:04.729> we<00:02:04.759> allow<00:02:05.180> for<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.630> turns<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.229> take

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
room we allow for the turns to take

I had been cutting in a little too close
which<00:03:11.000> may<00:03:11.180> explain<00:03:11.359> why<00:03:11.900> my<00:03:12.049> horse<00:03:12.320> sometimes

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.110

first<00:03:14.780> barrel<00:03:15.049> turn<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.739> again<00:03:16.250> we<00:03:16.579> go<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
first barrel turn and again we go to the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
left barrel first I also realized that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.300 
left barrel first I also realized that
placing<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.840> marker<00:03:21.170> at<00:03:21.260> 12<00:03:21.590> feet<00:03:21.829> seemed<00:03:22.190> to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
placing that marker at 12 feet seemed to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.099 
placing that marker at 12 feet seemed to
feel<00:03:22.489> more<00:03:22.730> suitable<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.420> my<00:03:23.510> current<00:03:23.780> horse

on the way to the second barrel it was a
subtle<00:03:39.019> thing<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.890> could<00:03:40.190> compromise<00:03:40.609> my

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
when I placed markers on the path I take

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.899 
when I placed markers on the path I take
around<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.170> barrels<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:58.920> measured<00:03:59.400> out<00:03:59.579> to

as possible in a straight line and we
all<00:04:15.090> know<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:16.259> the<00:04:16.590> fastest<00:04:17.100> way<00:04:17.130> between

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
all know that is the fastest way between

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.240 
all know that is the fastest way between
two<00:04:17.759> points<00:04:18.410> doing<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.560> doesn't<00:04:19.949> mean<00:04:20.039> my

two points doing this doesn't mean my

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.009 
two points doing this doesn't mean my
horse<00:04:20.519> has<00:04:20.759> a<00:04:20.789> roll<00:04:21.090> back<00:04:21.269> or<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> slingshot

run the path our horse's feet fall in
the<00:05:41.130> pattern<00:05:41.490> can<00:05:41.670> tell<00:05:41.850> us<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.120> lot<00:05:42.150> but<00:05:42.630> only

the pattern can tell us a lot but only

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.470 
the pattern can tell us a lot but only
if<00:05:43.260> we<00:05:43.410> pay<00:05:43.620> attention<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.580> study<00:05:44.880> where

if we pay attention to and study where
their<00:05:45.690> feet<00:05:45.900> are<00:05:46.080> getting<00:05:46.980> really<00:05:47.370> clear

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
their feet are getting really clear

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.850 
their feet are getting really clear
about<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.240> exact<00:05:48.600> football<00:05:49.110> you<00:05:49.440> want<00:05:49.710> your

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
horse to travel around the barrels is so

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.410 
horse to travel around the barrels is so
