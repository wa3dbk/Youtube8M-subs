to break the bottom block go up to the
top<00:01:25.920> place<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:28.610> pressure<00:01:29.610> plate<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:31.079> look

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
top place a pressure plate and then look

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.590 
top place a pressure plate and then look
at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> fence<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.180> place<00:01:33.950> two<00:01:35.060> stone<00:01:36.060> blocks

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to try and shoot as close to the the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.700 
to try and shoot as close to the the
pressure<00:01:50.369> plate<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.500> piston

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
pressure plate and get it on the piston

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
pressure plate and get it on the piston
as<00:01:53.100> possible<00:01:53.700> yeah<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.540> good<00:01:54.840> right

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
place a repeater with some redstone and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.580 
place a repeater with some redstone and
place<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> repeater<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.200> part<00:02:16.500> is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
place a repeater and then this part is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.720 
place a repeater and then this part is
very<00:02:16.799> important<00:02:17.159> you're<00:02:17.250> gonna<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.539 
very important you're gonna want to
quickly<00:02:18.000> place<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.080> then<00:02:19.290> quickly<00:02:19.769> break<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
quickly place and then quickly break the

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.080 
quickly place and then quickly break the
redstone<00:02:21.180> torch<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.879> you'll<00:02:23.879> get

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
redstone torch like this and you'll get

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.720 
redstone torch like this and you'll get
this<00:02:24.599> effect<00:02:24.959> oh<00:02:25.170> God<00:02:25.680> forgot<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> set<00:02:26.610> our

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
this effect oh God forgot to set our

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.180 
this effect oh God forgot to set our
timings<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.349> short<00:02:28.829> out<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.129> a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
timings so it's going to short out in a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.770 
timings so it's going to short out in a
second<00:02:29.549> let<00:02:29.670> me<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:30.239> ahead<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.450> save<00:02:30.659> it

you're gonna place and break the torch

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.610 
you're gonna place and break the torch
really<00:02:44.280> quick<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:45.079> if<00:02:46.079> this<00:02:46.349> thing's

really quick and if this thing's
flashing<00:02:47.099> on<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.250> off<00:02:47.430> that's<00:02:47.730> fine<00:02:48.000> if<00:02:48.239> it's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
flashing on and off that's fine if it's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.210 
flashing on and off that's fine if it's
not<00:02:48.569> that's<00:02:48.810> fine<00:02:48.930> too<00:02:49.079> as<00:02:49.590> long<00:02:49.620> as<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.069> arrow

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
not that's fine too as long as the arrow

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.830 
not that's fine too as long as the arrow
is<00:02:50.430> hitting<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.819> pressure<00:02:51.060> point<00:02:51.359> going<00:02:51.599> up

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
is hitting the pressure point going up

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.990 
is hitting the pressure point going up
and<00:02:51.989> down<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:53.280> you're<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.489> gonna<00:02:53.700> set

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and down and then you're just gonna set

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.809 
and down and then you're just gonna set
this<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.450> full<00:02:54.720> tick<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.590> delay<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.370> then

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
this to full tick of delay and then

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.490 
this to full tick of delay and then
you're<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:58.940> place<00:02:59.940> redstone<00:03:00.840> going

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
you're going to place redstone going

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.250 
you're going to place redstone going
down<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:03.049> for<00:03:04.049> out<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:05.700> five<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.599> then

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
down here for out or five and then

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.649 
down here for out or five and then
you're<00:03:07.379> going<00:03:07.530> for<00:03:07.829> place<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:09.030> stone<00:03:09.329> brick

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
you're going for place the stone brick

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.789 
you're going for place the stone brick
and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.079> you're<00:03:10.200> going<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.470> place<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
and then you're going to place a

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.849 
and then you're going to place a
redstone<00:03:11.129> torch<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.720> then<00:03:13.079> you're<00:03:13.470> going<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
redstone torch and then you're going to

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.280 
redstone torch and then you're going to
basically<00:03:14.609> from<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:15.150> you're<00:03:15.569> gonna<00:03:15.720> go<00:03:15.989> oh

god it was a fail you're going to run
this<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.260> wherever<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.889> you<00:03:22.950> want<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.269> go

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
this to wherever it is you want it to go

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.920 
this to wherever it is you want it to go
so<00:03:26.060> yeah<00:03:28.970> I'm<00:03:29.970> gonna<00:03:30.090> try<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.750> far

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
so yeah I'm gonna try and get it far

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.849 
so yeah I'm gonna try and get it far
enough<00:03:31.019> away<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.319> where<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> can't<00:03:31.970> hear<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
enough away to where I can't hear the

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.970 
enough away to where I can't hear the
mechanism<00:03:34.859> anymore<00:03:36.500> which<00:03:37.500> isn't<00:03:37.739> actually

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
mechanism anymore which isn't actually

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.670 
mechanism anymore which isn't actually
that<00:03:38.370> far<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.750> actually

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
that far you know it's like actually

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.289 
that far you know it's like actually
kind<00:03:40.919> of<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> short<00:03:41.310> distance<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:43.910> right<00:03:44.910> about

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
kind of a short distance so right about

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.559 
kind of a short distance so right about
there<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.290> then<00:03:46.739> make<00:03:47.579> sure<00:03:47.849> you<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.269> enough

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
there and then make sure you have enough

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.750 
there and then make sure you have enough
redstone<00:03:49.109> repeaters<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.799> here<00:03:49.949> to<00:03:50.310> keep<00:03:50.549> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
redstone repeaters in here to keep the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.280 
redstone repeaters in here to keep the
redstone<00:03:51.239> going<00:03:51.900> because<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:54.599> doesn't<00:03:54.959> go<00:03:55.079> on

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
redstone going because it doesn't go on

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.670 
redstone going because it doesn't go on
forever

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.530 

about<00:03:59.680> every<00:04:00.040> five<00:04:00.340> or<00:04:00.370> six<00:04:00.849> blocks<00:04:01.239> you're

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
about every five or six blocks you're

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.589 
about every five or six blocks you're
gonna<00:04:01.659> want<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.049> place<00:04:02.859> on<00:04:03.750> Peters<00:04:04.750> town<00:04:05.019> and

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
gonna want to place on Peters town and
