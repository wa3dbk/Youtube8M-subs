push it in so that it is more or less
flush<00:02:44.110> with<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.220> wall<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.910> don't<00:02:46.030> want<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
flush with the wall you don't want it to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.089 
flush with the wall you don't want it to
come<00:02:46.840> out<00:02:47.940> all<00:02:48.940> right<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.829> let<00:02:51.069> that

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
come out all right now we can let that

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.830 
come out all right now we can let that
dry<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> bit

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.140 

after<00:02:55.840> which<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.350> would<00:02:57.250> probably<00:02:57.430> coat<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.970> a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
after which I would probably coat it a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
after which I would probably coat it a
little<00:02:59.019> bit<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.380> my<00:02:59.590> bin<00:02:59.889> primer<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.989> is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
little bit with my bin primer this is

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.740 
little bit with my bin primer this is
the<00:03:02.290> fix-all<00:03:02.709> primer<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.359> use<00:03:04.389> on

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the fix-all primer that I like to use on

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.610 
the fix-all primer that I like to use on
job<00:03:05.019> sites<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.780> kind<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.109> seals<00:03:08.410> it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
job sites and it just kind of seals it

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.259 
job sites and it just kind of seals it
up<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.310> plaster<00:03:12.730> has<00:03:12.849> something<00:03:13.239> to

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
up so that the plaster has something to

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.930 
up so that the plaster has something to
stick<00:03:13.389> to<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:15.370> would<00:03:15.489> be<00:03:15.609> how<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.760> would

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
stick to and that would be how you would

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.430 
stick to and that would be how you would
fill<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:17.370> medium<00:03:18.370> sized<00:03:18.670> hole<00:03:19.079> that's<00:03:20.079> just<00:03:20.349> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
fill a medium sized hole that's just a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.159 
fill a medium sized hole that's just a
little<00:03:20.650> too<00:03:20.799> big<00:03:21.099> for<00:03:21.900> straight<00:03:22.900> joint

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
little too big for straight joint

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.309 
little too big for straight joint
compound<00:03:23.590> or<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.090> patching<00:03:25.090> compound<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:26.200> know

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
compound or a patching compound you know

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.069 
compound or a patching compound you know
this<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.620> much<00:03:26.799> bigger<00:03:27.010> than<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.609> nail<00:03:28.419> hole<00:03:28.720> or

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
this is much bigger than a nail hole or

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.800 
this is much bigger than a nail hole or
a<00:03:29.139> bolt<00:03:30.069> hole<00:03:30.280> from<00:03:30.579> a<00:03:30.639> television<00:03:31.209> but<00:03:31.599> it's<00:03:31.750> a

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
a bolt hole from a television but it's a

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.449 
a bolt hole from a television but it's a
little<00:03:31.930> too<00:03:32.139> small<00:03:32.440> for<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.739> large<00:03:32.980> patch<00:03:33.250> like

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
little too small for a large patch like

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.819 
little too small for a large patch like
that<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:34.989> is<00:03:35.049> just<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.380> little<00:03:35.560> trick<00:03:35.799> you

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
that so this is just a little trick you

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.099 
that so this is just a little trick you
can<00:03:35.980> use<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:37.060> we'll<00:03:37.150> let<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.329> dry<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.989> we'll

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
can use so we'll let that dry and we'll

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.960 
can use so we'll let that dry and we'll
put<00:03:38.260> our<00:03:38.349> plaster<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:38.889> okay<00:03:39.579> let's<00:03:39.790> take<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
put our plaster on okay let's take a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.580 
put our plaster on okay let's take a
look<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.769> large<00:03:42.190> patch<00:03:42.730> here<00:03:43.590> I've

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
look this is that large patch here I've

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800 
look this is that large patch here I've
got<00:03:44.829> my<00:03:44.859> metal<00:03:45.430> mesh<00:03:45.760> patch<00:03:46.150> right<00:03:46.450> underneath

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
got my metal mesh patch right underneath

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.800 
got my metal mesh patch right underneath
here<00:03:47.139> what<00:03:48.069> I<00:03:48.099> did<00:03:48.430> was<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.940> sanded<00:03:49.389> that<00:03:49.510> first

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810

here what I did was I sanded that first
coat<00:03:50.139> down<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.120> using<00:03:52.120> my<00:03:52.359> joint<00:03:52.720> compound<00:03:53.200> I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
coat down and using my joint compound I

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.500 
coat down and using my joint compound I
put<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> second<00:03:55.329> coat<00:03:55.859> nice<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.130> smooth<00:03:57.510> right

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510
