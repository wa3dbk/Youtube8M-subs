00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 why in Russia the worst roads in the world 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.699
 accessible and understandable 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.929
 reason number one is corruption 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.829
 every kilometer of roads russia costs in 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.689
 two and a half times more expensive than 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.060
 European countries 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.840
 compared to us, we overpay at three 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.949
 times more 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.839
 compared to China in 4 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.599
 why is russia so special that roads 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.369
 we build more expensive than in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460
 finland or alaska 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 simple answer 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.160
 so talnoe corruption in the road 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 construction 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 for real construction 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.329
 about a third of resources are directed 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.929
 this means that before rock could be built in 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.250
 three times more 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.690
 reason number two is outdated 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 technology 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.490
 tefft 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.670
 no longer invented 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.880
 modern technologies 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.970
 road construction 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.050
 Firstly, this is synthetic 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.940
 which does not allow the roadway 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.140
 to creep away 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.559
 evenly distributes 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.910
 load and removes moisture 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.150
 secondly road builders can 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.110
 use different polymeric 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.430
 bitumen and which allow asphalt not 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.170
 collapse at temperature 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.000
 modes from minus 40 c to plus five ten 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.579
 St. Petersburg 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.560
 subject to technology expensive 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.829
 serves 12 15 years they are 3 4 as now with it 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.469
 it is important to understand that when using 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.659
 modern materials total 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.909
 Estimated road increases total 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090
 only 1 2 percent 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.590
 However, construction and save this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.290
 the percentage of it does not just do not care about the result 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.270
 He hopes for a new order in 3 4 years 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.100
 when the road collapses in 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.720
 As a result, the usual bitumen is added. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410
 synthetics put only for visibility 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.570
 the edges of the road in 3 4 years the road need 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410
 repair again and again gets for 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.850
 repair money 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.390
 as a result 80 percent of the road 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.690
 Russian Fund until 2020 is planned 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.890
 spend on repairing old roads and only 20 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.729
 percent for renovation 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.829
 and building new 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.859
 and for the 2011th year of new construction in general 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.729
 not scheduled 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.409
 if you build roads by technology 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.219
 in 15 years we will have an average of 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.129
 four times more quality roads 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.959
 if this is completely removed 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.919
 corruption component 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.689
 expensive to manufacture roads 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.659
 three times 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.439
 then this number can be multiplied by another third 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.709
 This means that for the same money Russia 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.069
 can get 10 15 times more new 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.780
 roads 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.029
 in 12 15 years 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.109
 if you handle corruption and health 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.349
 Nani builders who do not use 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.729
 modern technology yet 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.619
 these are only dreams and Russia loses only 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.039
 on bad roads 6 8 percent of their Vova 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.999
 poet per year 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.989
 80 percent of accidents are related to traffic police 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.409
 with defective roads 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.449
 because of bad roads a year happens more 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.939
 one hundred and fifty thousand accidents and dies 20 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.200
 thousands of people 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.670
 one of whom may be someone 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.779
 that of your loved ones 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.810
 bring it to your friend neighbor 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.340
 and maybe this neighbor will be the mayor 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.020
 governor or president who 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.590
 enough will to look at 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.100
 the situation is fair 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.100
 open and start acting 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:32.669
 and then 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.679
 one day we can say 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:35.879
 Russia 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.360
 country of good roads
