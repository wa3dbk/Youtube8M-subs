find<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.840> fact<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.290> if<00:02:31.470> you're<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> Sega<00:02:32.100> fan

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
find it the fact is if you're a Sega fan

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.000 
find it the fact is if you're a Sega fan
like<00:02:33.090> me<00:02:33.330> you've<00:02:33.600> seen<00:02:33.810> them<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.530> out<00:02:34.650> better

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.610 
like me you've seen them put out better
collections<00:02:35.670> before<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:37.020> one<00:02:37.230> seems

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
collections before and this one seems

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.310 
collections before and this one seems
really<00:02:38.160> subpar<00:02:38.520> compared<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.870> others<00:02:40.290> like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
really subpar compared to others like

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.190 
really subpar compared to others like
