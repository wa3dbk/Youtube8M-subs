you<00:00:35.220> get<00:00:35.339> the<00:00:35.460> benefit<00:00:35.970> with<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:36.809> fuel

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you get the benefit with the fuel

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.660 
you get the benefit with the fuel
economy<00:00:37.199> and<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> lower<00:00:38.129> emission<00:00:38.550> figures

this<00:00:41.670> car<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.239> revolutionary<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
this car is really revolutionary and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
this car is really revolutionary and
it's<00:00:43.799> revolutionary<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.519> it<00:00:44.760> takes<00:00:45.000> what

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it's revolutionary because it takes what

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.689 
it's revolutionary because it takes what
is<00:00:45.299> a<00:00:45.330> small<00:00:45.690> engine<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.830> is<00:00:46.979> only<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.250> 1<00:00:47.460> litre

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
is a small engine this is only a 1 litre

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.820 
is a small engine this is only a 1 litre
remember<00:00:48.299> literally<00:00:48.930> measured<00:00:49.229> from<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.470> to

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
remember literally measured from here to

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.740 
remember literally measured from here to
here<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.909> all<00:00:50.970> you<00:00:51.059> boffins<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.570> there

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
here and for all you boffins out there

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.479 
here and for all you boffins out there
this<00:00:51.960> could<00:00:52.110> actually<00:00:52.260> fit<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.710> an<00:00:52.920> a4<00:00:53.040> sized

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
this could actually fit on an a4 sized

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.439 
this could actually fit on an a4 sized
that<00:00:53.670> piece<00:00:54.119> of<00:00:54.269> paper<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.900> is<00:00:55.049> that<00:00:55.260> small<00:00:56.449> but

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that piece of paper it is that small but

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
that piece of paper it is that small but
it<00:00:57.720> is<00:00:57.869> able<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> pull<00:00:58.619> what<00:00:58.830> is<00:00:58.949> quite<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.189> big

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it is able to pull what is quite a big

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
it is able to pull what is quite a big
car<00:00:59.780> because<00:01:00.780> Ford<00:01:01.080> add<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.589> turbocharger<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
car because Ford add a turbocharger and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.969 
car because Ford add a turbocharger and
this<00:01:03.299> really<00:01:03.689> represents<00:01:03.839> what<00:01:04.229> downsizing

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
this really represents what downsizing

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
this really represents what downsizing
is<00:01:05.339> all<00:01:05.489> about<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.330> gives<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> performance<00:01:07.229> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is all about it gives the performance of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280 
is all about it gives the performance of
a<00:01:07.470> bigger<00:01:07.650> engine<00:01:07.920> say<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> 1.6<00:01:09.119> litre<00:01:09.450> but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
a bigger engine say a 1.6 litre but

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.840 
a bigger engine say a 1.6 litre but
because<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.770> literally<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> 1<00:01:11.640> litre

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
because it is literally only a 1 litre

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 
because it is literally only a 1 litre
you<00:01:12.509> get<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:12.899> better<00:01:13.109> fuel<00:01:13.409> economy<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you get much better fuel economy and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
you get much better fuel economy and
also<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> emission<00:01:15.210> figures<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.600> reduced<00:01:15.899> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
also the emission figures are reduced to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.389 
also the emission figures are reduced to
the<00:01:16.320> extent<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.829> car<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.250> actually

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
the extent that this car is actually

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.550 
the extent that this car is actually
exempt<00:01:18.060> from<00:01:18.539> paying<00:01:18.840> any<00:01:19.049> road<00:01:19.259> fund<00:01:19.530> license

exempt from paying any road fund license

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.840 
exempt from paying any road fund license
this<00:01:22.560> being<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:22.920> smallest<00:01:23.189> engine<00:01:23.490> within

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this being the smallest engine within

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.940 
this being the smallest engine within
the<00:01:23.969> Ford<00:01:24.210> Focus<00:01:24.390> range<00:01:24.840> starts<00:01:25.469> at<00:01:25.590> price<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the Ford Focus range starts at price of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
the Ford Focus range starts at price of
just<00:01:26.100> under<00:01:26.340> 16<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.999> half<00:01:27.030> thousand<00:01:27.539> pounds

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
just under 16 and a half thousand pounds

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.569 
just under 16 and a half thousand pounds
here<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.140> UK<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:29.100> model<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
here in the UK this model is the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.450 
here in the UK this model is the
titanium<00:01:30.390> model<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.929> is<00:01:31.350> closer<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.679> 20,000

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
titanium model and is closer to 20,000

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.459 
titanium model and is closer to 20,000
pounds<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.899> get<00:01:34.079> things<00:01:34.289> like

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
pounds so for that you get things like

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.319 
pounds so for that you get things like
being<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> bigger<00:01:35.159> alloy<00:01:35.460> wheels<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.179> get

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
being the bigger alloy wheels you get

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.760 
being the bigger alloy wheels you get

you'll<00:01:44.399> agree<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.789> Ford<00:01:45.030> Focus<00:01:45.179> is<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
you'll agree the Ford Focus is it's a

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.499 
you'll agree the Ford Focus is it's a
big<00:01:46.140> car<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.710> seems<00:01:47.280> bigger<00:01:47.609> than<00:01:47.789> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
big car it seems bigger than the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.419 
big car it seems bigger than the
previous<00:01:48.749> generation<00:01:49.469> but<00:01:50.039> it<00:01:50.159> certainly

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
previous generation but it certainly

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.399 
previous generation but it certainly
doesn't<00:01:50.639> Drive<00:01:51.060> bigger<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.200> car<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
doesn't Drive bigger it's a car that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.410 
doesn't Drive bigger it's a car that
very<00:01:52.679> much<00:01:52.829> drinks<00:01:53.130> around<00:01:53.249> you<00:01:53.639> and<00:01:53.969> it<00:01:54.210> still

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
very much drinks around you and it still
