00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello youtube friends are welcome 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.910
 to this second double combat in the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.870
 random battles 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.570
 the pokemon x and pokemon guille wifi 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.270
 and well then if it waits for us 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.660
 let's go to the analysis of the equipment that 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.660
 they will see 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.700
 next facing 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.330
 Well, with my part, well, in this 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.210
 fight to perform and on the button doing 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.100
 hawley 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.860
 and all the PokÃ©mon that help the team 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 to keep about especially the moment 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.140
 offensive 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.710
 and in what my rival has a team of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 rain a climate team with polito 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.710
 Indra that will always be dangerous under the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.710
 rain in cangas with who would be his mega 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.350
 his mega pokemon and then while he 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.490
 It's always there for the pacers and everything 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 that 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.730
 and well, knowing that, I decided to do 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
 that choice of pokemon the other two 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.960
 that remained were for example typhoons 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.110
 and it was extended 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.750
 and then also the fight here because it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.229
 start with balls of indra silence 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.930
 against said alliance for the certain good 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.990
 at that time this with waiting for the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.479
 fear for the fake out but good this 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.740
 here the contest passes because it protects 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.290
 his politics thinking that fight and see me 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.580
 in some in analyzing well but good at 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.370
 your protection 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.020
 it hurts his fight 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.070
 but it caught by surprise that Indra 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.380
 because I had used rain dance for 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.049
 remove the sun 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.140
 of the possible cancer but good to it was 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.570
 a play in my favor pretty good with 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.700
 that at the time of the fight and took a 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.829
 little control is fine with your mission 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.179
 I imagine the direct facebook and 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:11.330
 very particular and that's why that gives 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.000
 opportunity to military to load a 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.550
 dragon dance 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.680
 and then with the possibility of attacking 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.440
 next turn here an escort 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.330
 Hipolito and get a critical hit 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.220
 in the rain and fortunately for me 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.810
 cause does not get me and in the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.200
 next turn because this one is high with 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 that attack bus, since it's more than anything 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.390
 manages to defeat the medium and to know 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.190
 that neither joke to be able to defeat the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.020
 cop thompson 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.210
 with his fight he decided to use Skype 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.180
 to buy time and not get 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.780
 the second attack on jest and could 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.000
 delete it in that shift and thus save 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.300
 many times with those busts for what 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300
 will come 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.410
 because the sin of is more than obvious 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.980
 decides to use protection since it is the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.349
 sin and the solutions of nation is 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.460
 dangerous and quite common in 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.190
 double bouts due to its great power 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.760
 good 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.260
 here it is when falling alone it supposes 217 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.380
 fuck fight that someone put 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.200
 smart since it's obvious I thought 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.560
 defeat chavistas with the change and 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.430
 well here in this turn for this wish 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.739
 saint claire leds for 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.359
 try to cause great damage I do not know if 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.900
 will put a right side a little more 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.299
 but good is already Friday what 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.890
 the fact of being the mask version and 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.590
 below, I did not lose anything 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.220
 in attacking in this way this slogan if 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.920
 double like in attack with power point 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.740
 you deal with this but I get that 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.170
 marley 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.680
 so it does not matter but 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.530
 for my luck 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.730
 this the chick that they do not know with 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.650
 then what 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.069
 like I expected to get stuck in 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.190
 plant or something like that but does not get it 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.080
 but the same alternative can then 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.660
 use my other 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.100
 in the next turn which is what it does 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.720
 it was many times what 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.470
 I practically was like leaving 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.900
 and stop 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.910
 that will defeat him and not assume so much the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.120
 risk of it changing and receiving a strong 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.270
 hit or games and if they are because despite 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.040
 that this issue not with the double trick 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.070
 in attack the castle by paula porsche 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.310
 If I got a little scared and I do well then 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.510
 see the wind and zizur and for all that 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.070
 does not achieve the same polygon it has 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.520
 a lot to see that my mouse does not have 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.950
 so many good so much and 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:00.110
 so much especially attack 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.510
 and anyway they are usually from 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.180
 special pensions defensive systems 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.400
 to withstand the blows and in trying to 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.620
 get in and out and good and good with that 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.660
 finish the fight with a double attack of 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.180
 part yes I'm a mouse since I had no case 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.510
 that will continue and with that has been the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.210
 today's match 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.520
 I hope you liked it and therefore 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.530
 took the opportunity to ask for an apology if 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.830
 I'm narrating in English but the game 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.780
 It's in Spanish but just like I said 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.510
 they record me the combats and how 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.050
 and how is Spain the game we should not 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.840
 Record 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.060
 well in Spanish usually 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.330
 I play in English and I'm very used to it 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.150
 by the in English so if they see what I do 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.710
 stanley or something like that you already know why 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.120
 it's just to clarify and well good 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.000
 repeating yes I already said I hope I have 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.680
 liked this they can leave their 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.590
 comments give you a 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.110
 I like favorites to share those that do not 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.090
 it cost nothing 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.860
 and well, I'll also let you know 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.780
 twitter is a description of the video 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.360
 to follow me and here what are left 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.830
 neither is it true but good obligation 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.830
 that's all for my part goodbye
