00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.310 
and somehow of course I wish I would win
but<00:02:27.520> since<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:28.090> didn't<00:02:28.739> look<00:02:29.739> at<00:02:29.890> him<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.310> I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
but since I didn't look at him and I

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.320 
but since I didn't look at him and I
experience<00:02:32.320> again<00:02:32.650> through<00:02:32.920> him<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.180> it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
experience again through him and it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.570 
experience again through him and it
motivates<00:02:34.840> me<00:02:35.080> since<00:02:35.890> he's<00:02:36.040> also<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> same

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
motivates me since he's also the same

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.300

rage<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.209> motivates<00:02:37.780> me<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.380> possible<00:02:38.890> it

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310
