00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
start to make some parallel slices I'm

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910 
start to make some parallel slices I'm
gonna<00:01:15.210> lift<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> handle<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> cutting

forward<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> cut<00:01:21.170> taking<00:01:22.170> my

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
forward and down to cut taking my

fingers underneath to hold on to the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.030 
fingers underneath to hold on to the
shallot<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.030> make<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.240> nice<00:01:31.040> thin

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
shallot and just make some nice thin

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
shallot and just make some nice thin
slices<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.180> thinner<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.540> make<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.990> slices<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
slices the thinner I make my slices the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310 
slices the thinner I make my slices the
finer<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.310> julienne<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:36.210> become<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
finer the julienne will become as I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.050 
finer the julienne will become as I
start<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.130> narrow<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
start to get really narrow here I can

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
start to get really narrow here I can
lay<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> shallot<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.110> its<00:01:40.290> cut<00:01:40.530> side<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
lay the shallot down on its cut side and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.360 
lay the shallot down on its cut side and
then<00:01:41.640> proceed<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.990> make<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.500> cuts

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.360
