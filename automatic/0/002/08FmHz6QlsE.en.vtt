00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
threaded holes I forward through holes

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.309 
threaded holes I forward through holes
it's<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.610> good<00:02:12.790> idea<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.390> clean<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.870> burr<00:02:14.019> off

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
it's a good idea to clean the burr off

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
grinder cut off each segment of the pipe

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.130 
grinder cut off each segment of the pipe
each<00:02:55.310> segment<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:55.970> pipe<00:02:56.300> becomes<00:02:56.810> one
