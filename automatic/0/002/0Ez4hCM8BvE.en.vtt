00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.310

 nothing can pump it anywhere 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.989
 we pay attention to it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.780
 and mod it also take away each 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.019
 playground is for each player 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 everyone will have his own hero his skills 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.340
 and fasten if you play but also with 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.060

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:33.319
 what we swing so so so so so but I 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.239
 I don’t know what to pump so I apnul 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:43.849
 passive dragon knight and passive 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.270

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.760
 suites 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:56.730
 three dyuks and we have such some 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:04:04.560
 incomprehensible not even hurt the suites 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:09.690
 it seems yes I repeat here keels need 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.940
 pick well by mind so say not that 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.190
 that scored mills dofiga I you this 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.350
 cool there is not such a ride so 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.390
 what do we still have here 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:37.830
 pump in 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:43.100
 so to be honest I do not know well, but about 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.100
 while I'm this one and this one 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.290
 so buy than we can buy all damn 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.050
 very expensive 5000 and 10,000 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:59.190
 rapier 11 thousand worth but it gives 450 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:03.290
 Bonus Damage What Bears We Have Here 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.290
 from bear they went 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.840
 I shaved them off so amazingly even 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.390
 so now you have to choose 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.400
 need to 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:23.260
 He probably this crap and pump up all 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.050
 Now we can not choose skills but 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.680
 we can here them here to sell but I 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.990
 I will not sell them I will apap them so 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.110
 what we have on one 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:40.120
 we haven't got anything yet 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:43.240
 Well apnu passivku centaur and passivku 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.440
 dragon and shorter nothing can dig 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:54.820
 You can buy a box for 150 coins, I will not 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:58.090
 so 150 damage gives five thousand worth these 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.230
 what is this type not croce 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.540
 but I bought them nothing interesting 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:13.570
 Do not give kine puddle 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:17.290
 let them decrease armor -3 what am I 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.420
 lost as they were so apparently 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.240
 is there some kind of crystal flew out or 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.640
 why is it so cool to be honest 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.670
 I really liked it here 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.220
 different builds you can collect heroes 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.030
 play none but each 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.800
 will have its own such a square and 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.270
 your skills and all new each other 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.910
 we will not fight 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.550
 everyone will have their own arena so to speak 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.090
