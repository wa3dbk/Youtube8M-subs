knock<00:03:56.860> over<00:03:57.130> not<00:03:57.460> only<00:03:57.490> just<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.270> tower<00:03:58.660> but

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
knock over not only just the tower but

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.410 
knock over not only just the tower but
the<00:03:59.380> Knights<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.220> tower<00:04:00.430> but<00:04:00.940> as<00:04:01.150> you

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the Knights and the tower but as you

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.690 
the Knights and the tower but as you
continue<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.930> play<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.920> levels<00:04:03.280> do<00:04:03.490> get<00:04:03.670> a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
continue to play the levels do get a

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.690 
continue to play the levels do get a
little<00:04:03.820> bit<00:04:04.060> more<00:04:04.300> hard<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:06.130> structure

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
little bit more hard and the structure

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.490 
little bit more hard and the structure
of<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.880> tower<00:04:07.180> begins<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.810> change<00:04:08.050> which

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
of the tower begins to change which

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.230 
of the tower begins to change which
makes<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.860> harder<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.250> knock<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.790> Knights<00:04:10.030> on

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
makes it harder to knock the Knights on

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.190 
makes it harder to knock the Knights on
the<00:04:10.420> ground<00:04:11.490> overall<00:04:12.490> I<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.240> visuals<00:04:13.900> are

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the ground overall I like it visuals are

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.520 
the ground overall I like it visuals are
stunning<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.880> do<00:04:16.450> recommend<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.230> one<00:04:17.410> as

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
stunning and I do recommend this one as

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:40.510 
stunning and I do recommend this one as
well

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.790 

next<00:04:41.520> we<00:04:41.699> have<00:04:41.879> falling<00:04:42.330> Fred<00:04:42.659> now<00:04:43.259> this<00:04:43.559> one

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
next we have falling Fred now this one

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.499 
next we have falling Fred now this one
was<00:04:43.949> a<00:04:43.979> little<00:04:44.189> bit<00:04:44.430> more<00:04:44.610> difficult<00:04:45.180> for<00:04:45.240> me

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
was a little bit more difficult for me

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.719 
was a little bit more difficult for me
to<00:04:45.749> demonstrate<00:04:45.960> because<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.009> doing<00:04:47.309> so<00:04:47.669> you

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
to demonstrate because in doing so you

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.360 
to demonstrate because in doing so you
have<00:04:47.879> to<00:04:48.300> tilt<00:04:48.569> your<00:04:48.659> device<00:04:48.809> in<00:04:49.469> order<00:04:50.039> to

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
have to tilt your device in order to

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.640 
have to tilt your device in order to
make<00:04:50.520> Fred<00:04:50.879> fall<00:04:51.240> at<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.689> appropriate<00:04:52.199> angle

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
make Fred fall at the appropriate angle

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.409 
make Fred fall at the appropriate angle
and<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.889> was<00:04:52.979> kind<00:04:53.189> of<00:04:53.249> hard<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.550> keep<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.939> iPad

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
and it was kind of hard to keep the iPad

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.570 
and it was kind of hard to keep the iPad
and<00:04:54.629> focus<00:04:55.080> while<00:04:55.199> doing<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:55.860> but<00:04:56.219> I'll<00:04:56.339> show

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
and focus while doing so but I'll show

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.320 
and focus while doing so but I'll show
you<00:04:56.639> what<00:04:56.909> I<00:04:56.939> can

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
you what I can

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.600 
you what I can
now<00:04:57.719> the<00:04:58.110> object<00:04:58.499> of<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.740> game<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:58.949> to<00:04:59.370> help

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
now the object of the game is to help

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.299 
now the object of the game is to help
Fred<00:05:00.029> have<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.629> safe<00:05:01.080> fall<00:05:01.499> so<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.830> don't<00:05:02.129> want

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:02.309 
Fred have a safe fall so you don't want

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.010 
Fred have a safe fall so you don't want
to<00:05:02.400> bump<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.819> sides<00:05:03.089> are<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.539> objects<00:05:03.960> that

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
to bump the sides are the objects that

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.320 
to bump the sides are the objects that
get<00:05:04.289> in<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.499> way<00:05:04.529> but<00:05:05.189> what<00:05:05.339> stood<00:05:05.580> out<00:05:05.759> to<00:05:05.879> me

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
get in the way but what stood out to me

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.350 
get in the way but what stood out to me
with<00:05:06.509> this<00:05:06.719> game<00:05:07.020> is<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.490> visuals<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.729> is<00:05:08.879> very

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
with this game is the visuals it is very

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.170 
with this game is the visuals it is very
very<00:05:09.719> graphic<00:05:10.309> and<00:05:11.309> you<00:05:11.399> don't<00:05:11.580> want<00:05:11.789> Fred<00:05:12.149> to

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
very graphic and you don't want Fred to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.360 
very graphic and you don't want Fred to
bump<00:05:12.629> his<00:05:12.779> head<00:05:12.809> and<00:05:13.349> if<00:05:13.740> he<00:05:13.860> bumps<00:05:14.129> his<00:05:14.339> head

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
bump his head and if he bumps his head

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.439 
bump his head and if he bumps his head
then<00:05:15.120> it's<00:05:15.930> pretty<00:05:16.229> much<00:05:16.439> a<00:05:16.499> tragedy<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.449> last

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
then it's pretty much a tragedy and last

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.399 
then it's pretty much a tragedy and last
we<00:05:18.930> have<00:05:18.960> Bubble<00:05:19.620> island<00:05:20.249> now<00:05:21.059> this<00:05:21.719> one<00:05:22.050> is

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
we have Bubble island now this one is

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.100 
we have Bubble island now this one is
similar<00:05:23.069> to<00:05:23.610> Zuma<00:05:24.210> Jumba<00:05:24.960> don't<00:05:25.770> by<00:05:25.889> thinking

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
similar to Zuma Jumba don't by thinking

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.230 
similar to Zuma Jumba don't by thinking
Zuma<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.740> one<00:05:28.919> is<00:05:29.039> similar<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.580> Zuma<00:05:30.029> and

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
Zuma this one is similar to Zuma and

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.269 
Zuma this one is similar to Zuma and
also<00:05:30.899> another<00:05:31.259> game<00:05:31.529> I<00:05:31.649> showed<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:31.979> past

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
also another game I showed in the past

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.309 
also another game I showed in the past
called<00:05:32.610> bubble<00:05:33.029> galaxies<00:05:33.689> the<00:05:33.990> game<00:05:34.169> is

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
called bubble galaxies the game is

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.719 
called bubble galaxies the game is
rather<00:05:34.439> simple<00:05:34.830> can<00:05:35.099> be<00:05:35.219> used<00:05:35.520> with<00:05:35.699> one

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
rather simple can be used with one

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.670 
rather simple can be used with one
finger<00:05:36.300> as<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:36.539> see<00:05:36.689> me<00:05:36.839> doing<00:05:36.990> here<00:05:37.139> all<00:05:37.529> you

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
finger as you see me doing here all you

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.260 
finger as you see me doing here all you
have<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.979> do<00:05:38.129> is<00:05:38.309> angle<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.759> balls<00:05:38.969> in<00:05:39.180> the

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
have to do is angle the balls in the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.050 
have to do is angle the balls in the
appropriate<00:05:39.779> place<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.379> match<00:05:40.949> its<00:05:41.249> color<00:05:41.580> so

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
appropriate place to match its color so

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.820 
appropriate place to match its color so
if<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.419> have<00:05:42.599> a<00:05:42.629> red<00:05:42.930> ball<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.319> want<00:05:43.499> to<00:05:43.620> group

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
if you have a red ball you want to group

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.920 
if you have a red ball you want to group
it<00:05:44.009> with<00:05:44.129> the<00:05:44.249> red<00:05:44.459> and<00:05:44.729> a<00:05:45.149> blue<00:05:45.360> ball<00:05:45.599> with<00:05:45.779> the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
it with the red and a blue ball with the

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.510 
it with the red and a blue ball with the
blue<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:46.499> forth<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:46.979> so<00:05:47.189> on

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
blue and so forth and so on

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.429 
blue and so forth and so on
you<00:05:47.849> need<00:05:47.999> a<00:05:48.029> group<00:05:48.330> of<00:05:48.569> three<00:05:48.839> colors<00:05:49.110> in

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
you need a group of three colors in

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.679 
you need a group of three colors in
order<00:05:49.919> for<00:05:50.189> that<00:05:50.399> section<00:05:50.729> of<00:05:50.999> balls<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.419> drop

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
order for that section of balls to drop

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.839 
order for that section of balls to drop
but<00:05:51.990> it's<00:05:52.110> a<00:05:52.199> rather<00:05:52.289> simple<00:05:52.740> game<00:05:52.949> something

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
but it's a rather simple game something

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:08.260 
but it's a rather simple game something
relaxing<00:05:54.449> to<00:05:54.629> do<00:05:54.779> to<00:05:54.959> help<00:05:55.080> pass<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.349> time

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.969 

but<00:06:09.270> that<00:06:09.419> does<00:06:09.659> sum<00:06:09.930> everything<00:06:10.199> up<00:06:10.379> if<00:06:10.860> you

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
but that does sum everything up if you

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.740 
but that does sum everything up if you
