00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.430
 look for the end of the wool we take it out 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 center of the konate mud that makes us a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.469
 little knot flowing in it means 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 that it grows as it closes 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.170
 this trip we try to be quite flat 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 klein - the rain then the left hand 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.280
 left and right 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.320
 I hold my hook will make 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.170
 mesh sunday in laye a mesh in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.840
 look if we take like that a jetty and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.420
 we pass it through the support mesh 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 we had first maillan line 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.920
 it makes dive a mesh to perform 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.799
 in this second of mayans la r it's 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.390
 always to have stitches of the same 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.390
 intentional blade 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.450
 finally in one 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.940
 m 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 they are coming 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.080
 Yes 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.500
 in that the kaori we will do 10 cm 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.690
 wide and actually doing it 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.970
 closes 12 my wide but with the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.830
 first row we have to make 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.550
 mesh more hands in the air that go 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.500
 play the role of the 12th stitch and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.000
 mayans russia plays the role of 12th 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.470
 man so these two jerseys for the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 leave out to go do our 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.360
 first breeze first half bridle 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.989
 here in this death 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.840
 it's very different the first row 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.670
 than all the others because after we 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 will already have a runaway job or 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.070
 with gold to make a half bridle you 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.350
 take a jetty like this live 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.989
 to go sting dallas and about which he speaks 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.519

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.440
 wool end that confesses alice comes back to 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.019
 through the stitch you stitched 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.330
 in there you have three loops are 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.190
 your crash and teach them a 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.410
 problem and get it through 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.900
 these three you that we have you your 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.030
 first half brede to go do that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.250
 all along on your site every 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.900
 little bowl that you created everything to 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 the time you have not stung da and m6 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.569
 the replica had 12 children at 11 he 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.030
 should stay right because you have 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.890
 two first two are done i'm going 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.500
 show you with a job that is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.780
 already started you if you see there is 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.840
 already several rows of fact one 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.220
 happens after one year to change 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.950
 board we'll do two ways in the air 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.409
 as I showed you to go do 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.950
 of green jersey to turn your 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.900
 project like this and here it's your 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.700
 first breathed me flange 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.569
 you're going to see keep there anyway 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.549
 a path of corn and a mesh is 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.099
 really two ball 1 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.170
 one long side of 2 2 strands 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.700
 lijn that form a kind of small v 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.109
 because the voice time acquired here 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.060
 we see like a little hole at each 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.940
 flat but when we look on the top 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.970
 ah we see a kind of small bike to 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.169
 dock every single one you tried you did me 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.459
 that time but we will mourn 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.709
 flange 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.400
 we take a gt will be able to sting us 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.320
 in the first here a radar the blues 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.919
 to be motivated 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.680
 together we take to throw and we go 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.020
 go through the holes like that one 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.910
 take I wait hate we want to sting 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.050
 the next look we see it well 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.870
 here in your spades at work 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.630
 we take a jetty at the worst it makes us 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.060
 three loops on our hook she 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.810
 should always by sow 3 book hop on 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.449

 a goal for these stories and that's it 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:12.750
 I was happy this job was before 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:18.979
 moment to make a square I think that 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:22.440

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.909

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.030
