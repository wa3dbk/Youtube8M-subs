00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 nine people of the dexia and by around back 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.110
 to what was better but two 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.250
 first of all, both can fall asleep 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 and secondly highly recommended 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.090
 never check how big a firmer one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 before he picks up that could happen 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.279
 She often just filed and is today 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.189
 stays 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.189
 just as with this great body &amp; 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.690
 soul make up you fuck me i love 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.690
 this web 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.600
 Mike away that went fast 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 that fits just because you see you have 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.890
 you before against the roma later from 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.440
 You can get yourself four gigawatt one 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.989
 No, it was already then I think so too 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 regulate the optional ladder their code of conduct it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.660
 skeptical about the recording is what 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.979
 is of course totally cool well in any case 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.840
 since we talked exactly 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.170
 Well, where all thread codex exists exactly 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 two rules the first one will speak 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 not about the mountain code of honor 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.000
 second one is not allowed too much of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 the opponent is waiting and writing as well 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.210
 not in front of the hole where I that you 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.210
 know that's perfectly true that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.800
 first in tibet before albert frey it is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.440
 the orphaned player goes first 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.080
 and the quasi preference who as 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.869
 to offer the only goal and the opponents 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.869
 to tell ok doing here is I can 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.300
 here by chemical and then let 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:59.569
 and meanwhile creeping 2 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.569
 out and tried so many cisco 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.600
 natasha judge and many themselves and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:16.460
 I do not even know how to cancel 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:20.500
 So here we would do with daily 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.500
 hold no netflow tail owns yes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.870
 that was the most beautiful karate I ever had 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.140
 have seen 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.190
 not only because that was the time 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.190
 is generally the respective 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.730
 and there is also a wall that's 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.340
 absolutely not important 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 There is no turning point we are all 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.110

 So here from the opponent 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.420
 never saw one like that 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.890
 was placed precisely and so much 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.319
 I wanted to do that 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.829
 German statement but hey that is 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.829
