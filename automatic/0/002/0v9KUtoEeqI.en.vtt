okay<00:00:02.310> Nick<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:02.820> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.090> show<00:00:03.419> you<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.780> I

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay Nick I'm going to show you how I

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.740 
okay Nick I'm going to show you how I
was<00:00:04.410> doing<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:07.670> string<00:00:08.670> against<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.570> arrow

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
was doing the string against the arrow

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.450 
was doing the string against the arrow
so<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.500> start<00:00:10.710> with<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> piece<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.130> string

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
so I just start with a piece of string

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.480 
so I just start with a piece of string
here<00:00:11.820> that's<00:00:12.059> about<00:00:12.300> 12<00:00:13.200> inches<00:00:13.380> long<00:00:13.559> it's

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
here that's about 12 inches long it's

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.840 
here that's about 12 inches long it's
probably<00:00:14.880> longer<00:00:15.420> than<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:15.809> I'll<00:00:15.929> need<00:00:16.850> but

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
probably longer than what I'll need but

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.060 
probably longer than what I'll need but
what<00:00:18.180> I'm<00:00:18.270> gonna<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.800> actually<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
what I'm gonna do actually I'm going to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.820 
what I'm gonna do actually I'm going to
zoom<00:00:20.250> out<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:23.359> here<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.449> go<00:00:24.830> so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
zoom out a little bit here here we go so

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.259 
zoom out a little bit here here we go so
start<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> piece<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.519> string<00:00:26.789> about<00:00:27.060> 12

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
start with a piece of string about 12

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
start with a piece of string about 12
inches<00:00:27.510> long<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.949> I'm

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
inches long what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.939 
inches long what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> make<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.539> loop<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.810> part<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.710> rope

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
going to make a loop in part of the rope

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.700 
going to make a loop in part of the rope
that<00:00:32.189> part<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> string<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.469> loop

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that part of the string and so this loop

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.490 
that part of the string and so this loop
only<00:00:34.920> needs<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.579> long<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
only needs to be as long as the the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.670 
only needs to be as long as the the
lashing<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.250> gonna<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.230> it's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
lashing that I'm gonna do and it's it's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
lashing that I'm gonna do and it's it's
okay<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.280> starts<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:42.120> too<00:00:42.300> long

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
okay it starts out a little bit too long

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.319 
okay it starts out a little bit too long
because<00:00:43.110> you're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> trim<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> ends<00:00:44.329> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
because you're going to trim the ends so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.049 
because you're going to trim the ends so
we<00:00:45.450> used<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> loop<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.030> kind<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
we used to make the loop and you kind of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
we used to make the loop and you kind of
hold<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.660> against<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.469> side<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
hold it here against the the side of the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.529 
hold it here against the the side of the
arrow<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> push<00:00:51.390> down

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
arrow and then I'm going to push down

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.810 
arrow and then I'm going to push down
with<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.870> finger<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.860> hold<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> still<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.670> I've

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
with my finger to hold it still so I've

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.180 
with my finger to hold it still so I've
got<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> short<00:00:54.300> end<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.870> that's<00:00:55.140> gonna<00:00:55.289> that's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
got a short end here that's gonna that's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
got a short end here that's gonna that's
going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> stay<00:00:56.640> hanging<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> end<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
going to stay hanging out to the end and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
going to stay hanging out to the end and
then<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> other<00:00:58.949> direction<00:00:59.340> I've<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
then the other direction I've got the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
then the other direction I've got the
got<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> loop<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
got the loop there so I'm just going to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.240 
got the loop there so I'm just going to
put<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.789> finger<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.860> gonna<00:01:04.979> grab

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
put my finger here and I'm gonna grab

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
put my finger here and I'm gonna grab
this<00:01:05.430> long<00:01:05.700> piece<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.090> hanging<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> end

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
this long piece it's hanging off the end

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.700 
this long piece it's hanging off the end
and<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.140> gonna<00:01:07.320> start<00:01:07.560> lashing<00:01:07.830> around<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
and I'm gonna start lashing around and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.200 
and I'm gonna start lashing around and
I'm<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.860> try<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> keep<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.850> close

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I'm gonna try to keep it kind of close

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
I'm gonna try to keep it kind of close
here<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.790> spread<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.320> bit

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
here but if I spread out a little bit

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
here but if I spread out a little bit
like<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> big<00:01:17.909> deal<00:01:18.270> because

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
like this it's not a big deal because

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
like this it's not a big deal because
what<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> push<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
what you can do is you can just push it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
what you can do is you can just push it
together<00:01:21.600> kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> squish<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.590> together<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
together kind of squish it together so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.330 
together kind of squish it together so
after<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.180> make<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> where's<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.950> four<00:01:26.220> five<00:01:26.869> six

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
after I make so where's a four five six

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.980 
after I make so where's a four five six
seven<00:01:29.340> eight<00:01:30.920> nine<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:34.549> ten<00:01:35.750> see<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:36.840> it's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
seven eight nine and ten see how it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.990 
seven eight nine and ten see how it's
all<00:01:37.079> spread<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> do

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
all spread out all I really have to do

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.539 
all spread out all I really have to do
is<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.409> give<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.619> push<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:42.110> it'll

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
is just give it a little push and it'll

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
is just give it a little push and it'll
tighten<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:44.939> nicely<00:01:45.210> okay<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.170> after

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.010 
tighten up pretty nicely okay so after
I've<00:01:46.649> made<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> last<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.630> here's<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> piece

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I've made the last one here's the piece

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.410 
I've made the last one here's the piece
that<00:01:49.200> I've<00:01:49.320> been<00:01:49.500> lashing<00:01:49.799> around<00:01:50.369> I'm<00:01:50.970> gonna

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that I've been lashing around I'm gonna

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.770 
that I've been lashing around I'm gonna
just<00:01:51.689> put<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> through<00:01:52.670> look<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:54.390> back<00:01:54.540> under

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
just put it through look get back under

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.429 
just put it through look get back under
the<00:01:55.399> under<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> camera<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.140> I'm<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.320> gonna

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.789 
the under the camera here I'm just gonna
push<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.979> through<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.329> loop<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.840> left<00:02:01.229> at

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
push it through the loop that I left at

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.319 
push it through the loop that I left at
the<00:02:01.950> beginning<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.969> now<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.030> it's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the beginning and so now that it's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
the beginning and so now that it's
through<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> loop<00:02:06.899> when<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> pull<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
through the loop when I pull on this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.790 
through the loop when I pull on this
other<00:02:08.310> end<00:02:08.640> over<00:02:08.849> here

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.680 

it's<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.580> pull<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.880> all<00:02:14.000> close<00:02:14.300> together

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's going to pull it all close together

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.250 
it's going to pull it all close together
now<00:02:15.490> what<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:16.610> want<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.990> loop

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
now what you want to do is the the loop

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.450 
now what you want to do is the the loop
has<00:02:18.470> just<00:02:18.860> now<00:02:19.010> started<00:02:19.520> going<00:02:19.850> inside<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
has just now started going inside of the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.790 
has just now started going inside of the
the<00:02:22.460> lashing<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.810> want<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.080> pull<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.290> loop

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the lashing you want to pull that loop

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.940 
the lashing you want to pull that loop
about<00:02:25.310> half<00:02:25.610> way<00:02:25.880> through<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:27.440> once<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.830> get

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
about half way through and once you get

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.560 
about half way through and once you get
it<00:02:28.070> about<00:02:28.220> halfway<00:02:28.490> through<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.120> pull<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
it about halfway through you pull on the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.850 
it about halfway through you pull on the
ends<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.840> little<00:02:30.080> bit<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.320> don't<00:02:30.350> have<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.710> pull

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
ends a little bit you don't have to pull

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.890 
ends a little bit you don't have to pull
real<00:02:31.100> real<00:02:31.280> tight<00:02:31.550> make<00:02:32.450> sure<00:02:32.480> everything

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
real real tight make sure everything

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.210 
real real tight make sure everything
looks<00:02:32.930> good<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.680> then<00:02:34.630> I'm<00:02:35.630> gonna<00:02:35.950> my<00:02:36.950> knots

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
looks good and then I'm gonna my knots

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.790 
looks good and then I'm gonna my knots
on<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.610> other<00:02:37.850> pieces<00:02:38.420> are<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.960> side<00:02:39.230> so

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
on the other pieces are on this side so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.410 
on the other pieces are on this side so
I'm<00:02:39.860> just<00:02:39.980> going<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> twist<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.210> can

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
I'm just going to twist it and I can

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.450 
I'm just going to twist it and I can
slide<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.050> down<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.320> arrow<00:02:42.620> shaft<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.250> get

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
slide it on down the arrow shaft to get

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.970 
slide it on down the arrow shaft to get
this<00:02:43.670> where<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.910> want<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.200> once<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.560> have<00:02:45.800> it

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
this where I want it and once I have it

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.730 
this where I want it and once I have it
in<00:02:46.130> just<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.580> right<00:02:46.820> spot<00:02:47.170> all<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.440> have<00:02:48.590> to

in just the right spot all you have to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.860 
in just the right spot all you have to
do<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.010> trim<00:02:49.340> off<00:02:49.610> these<00:02:49.850> two<00:02:50.180> extra<00:02:50.780> pieces

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:10.810 

little<00:02:56.870> snip<00:02:57.140> here<00:03:01.000> little<00:03:02.000> snip<00:03:02.240> there<00:03:09.820> get

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
little snip here little snip there get

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.570 
little snip here little snip there get
your<00:03:11.000> superglue<00:03:11.860> which<00:03:12.860> I'm<00:03:13.010> looking<00:03:13.160> for<00:03:13.490> my

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
your superglue which I'm looking for my

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.400 
your superglue which I'm looking for my
super<00:03:13.940> glue<00:03:14.120> right<00:03:14.330> now<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.750> disappeared<00:03:14.930> on

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
super glue right now it's disappeared on

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.950 
super glue right now it's disappeared on
me<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.300> two<00:03:23.480> little<00:03:23.780> pieces

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
me so I have to the two little pieces

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.140 
me so I have to the two little pieces
that<00:03:24.410> were<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.770> left<00:03:25.310> right<00:03:25.460> there<00:03:25.790> just

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
that were just left right there just

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.390 
that were just left right there just
take<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.510> superglue<00:03:26.960> and<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:28.070> drop

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
take the superglue and the little drop

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.600 
take the superglue and the little drop
on<00:03:28.610> each<00:03:28.760> end<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.390> then<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.290> little<00:03:30.560> bit<00:03:31.220> across

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
on each end and then a little bit across

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:42.480 
on each end and then a little bit across
the<00:03:31.850> back<00:03:32.030> here<00:03:33.820> like<00:03:34.820> that

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.390 

so<00:03:43.210> all<00:03:44.050> these<00:03:44.260> knots<00:03:44.590> are<00:03:44.830> lined<00:03:45.010> up<00:03:45.130> on<00:03:45.310> the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
so all these knots are lined up on the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.680 
so all these knots are lined up on the
backside<00:03:45.580> of<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:45.940> arrow<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.330> they<00:03:46.480> won't<00:03:46.570> have

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
backside of the arrow so they won't have

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.840 
backside of the arrow so they won't have
to<00:03:46.900> show<00:03:47.050> when<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.440> super<00:03:47.740> glue<00:03:47.770> dries<00:03:48.190> it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
to show when that super glue dries it

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.550 
to show when that super glue dries it
won't<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.450> won't<00:03:49.540> twist<00:03:49.750> around<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.350> arrow

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
won't it won't twist around the arrow

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.430 
won't it won't twist around the arrow
the<00:03:51.040> knots<00:03:51.250> won't<00:03:51.550> come<00:03:51.730> undone<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.140> it's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
the knots won't come undone it's a it's

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.080 
the knots won't come undone it's a it's
pretty<00:03:53.680> sturdy<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.400> then<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.850> other<00:03:54.880> side

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
pretty sturdy and then on the other side

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.150 
pretty sturdy and then on the other side
we<00:03:56.050> look<00:03:56.230> at<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.410> other<00:03:56.560> side<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:56.950> arrow

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
we look at the other side of the arrow

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.180 
we look at the other side of the arrow
you<00:03:57.340> don't<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.850> any<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.360> knots<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> all

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
you don't see any of the knots so all

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.370 
you don't see any of the knots so all
you<00:04:00.640> see<00:04:00.850> left<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.630> knot<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:02.020> just<00:04:02.260> this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
you see left of the knot is just this

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.770 
you see left of the knot is just this
little<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:03.430> little<00:04:03.670> piece<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.970> string<00:04:04.060> it's

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
little this little piece of string it's

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.720 
little this little piece of string it's
kind<00:04:04.990> of<00:04:05.050> hard<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.260> trim<00:04:05.590> completely<00:04:06.550> off

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
kind of hard to trim completely off

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.580 
kind of hard to trim completely off
hanging<00:04:07.090> off<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.390> end<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.660> arrow<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.560> I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
hanging off the end of the arrow so I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.220 
hanging off the end of the arrow so I
hope<00:04:08.770> that<00:04:08.830> helps<00:04:09.160> you
