00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that so that actually brings me into

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.520 
curling wand it actually did holds
really<00:03:24.160> well<00:03:24.310> but<00:03:25.180> like<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.540> second<00:03:25.960> day<00:03:26.200> it's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
really well but like the second day it's

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.000 
really well but like the second day it's
not<00:03:26.710> gonna<00:03:26.860> be<00:03:27.130> as<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:28.530> defined<00:03:29.530> as<00:03:29.740> it<00:03:29.890> was

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
not gonna be as like defined as it was

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.120 
not gonna be as like defined as it was
on<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.220> first<00:03:30.430> day<00:03:30.610> which<00:03:30.820> is<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.210> be<00:03:31.330> expected

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
on the first day which is to be expected

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.650 
on the first day which is to be expected
personally<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.370> holds<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.910> curl<00:03:34.090> well<00:03:34.390> enough

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
personally it holds a curl well enough

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.290 
personally it holds a curl well enough
for<00:03:34.870> me<00:03:35.110> but<00:03:35.830> if<00:03:36.040> you're<00:03:36.250> looking<00:03:36.760> for<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.150> to

curling<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.200> up<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.560> then<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:45.010> kind<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.310> drops

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
curling it up and then it kind of drops

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.850 
curling it up and then it kind of drops

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.390 
it's really fair for this kind of hair I
received<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:33.220> think<00:04:34.350> three<00:04:35.350> or<00:04:35.380> four<00:04:35.650> bundles

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
received I think three or four bundles

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.390 
received I think three or four bundles
from<00:04:36.970> her<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:38.110> ended<00:04:38.440> up<00:04:38.590> using<00:04:38.800> probably

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
from her and I ended up using probably

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.250 
from her and I ended up using probably
like<00:04:39.640> two<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> half<00:04:40.420> like<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.050> don't<00:04:41.170> even

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
like two and a half like I don't even

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.680 
like two and a half like I don't even
think<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.560> use<00:04:41.740> three<00:04:42.160> full<00:04:42.460> bundles<00:04:42.880> because<00:04:43.600> I

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
think I use three full bundles because I

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.810 
think I use three full bundles because I
don't<00:04:43.870> like<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.470> don't<00:04:45.100> like<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.580> be<00:04:45.640> too
