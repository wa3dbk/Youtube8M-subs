00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
one out on the left side of the motor

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.410 
one out on the left side of the motor
this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> side<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:14.030> attached<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
this is the side that is attached on to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.420 
this is the side that is attached on to
the<00:00:15.509> primary<00:00:15.809> chain<00:00:16.460> via<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.699> compensator<00:00:19.430> as

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the primary chain via the compensator as

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.109 
the primary chain via the compensator as
you<00:00:20.580> see<00:00:20.760> I've<00:00:20.850> got<00:00:21.029> my<00:00:21.060> dial<00:00:21.359> indicator

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
you see I've got my dial indicator

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.410 
you see I've got my dial indicator
perpendicular<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.380> nice<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> tight<00:00:26.420> mounted

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
perpendicular and nice and tight mounted

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.150 
perpendicular and nice and tight mounted
on<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
on a I don't know if you can see I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
on a I don't know if you can see I
zoomed<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.910> had<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> mount<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> phone<00:00:31.080> on

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
zoomed it in I had a mount the phone on

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.250 
zoomed it in I had a mount the phone on
a<00:00:31.260> chair<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.399> taped<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> chair

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
a chair actually that taped to a chair

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.400 
a chair actually that taped to a chair
but<00:00:34.370> as<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.910> though<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:37.140> dial

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
but as you can see though that this dial

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.580 
but as you can see though that this dial
indicator<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.780> very<00:00:39.780> perpendicular

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
indicator is actually very perpendicular

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
indicator is actually very perpendicular
in<00:00:40.710> square<00:00:41.070> I've<00:00:41.219> also<00:00:41.399> put<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:41.960> some<00:00:42.960> marks

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
in square I've also put some some marks

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
in square I've also put some some marks
on<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.950> off<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.730> mark<00:00:45.030> right

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
on and off you can see that mark right

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.799 
on and off you can see that mark right
there<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.190> I'm<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.370> turn<00:00:47.579> 180<00:00:48.180> degrees<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
there and I'm gonna turn 180 degrees and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.119 
there and I'm gonna turn 180 degrees and
I'm<00:00:48.870> gonna<00:00:49.370> ice<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.879> crank<00:00:51.300> by<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
I'm gonna ice this crank by the way is

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.090 
I'm gonna ice this crank by the way is
scissored<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.899> quite<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
scissored and it's out quite a bit and I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.790 
scissored and it's out quite a bit and I
will<00:00:56.460> show<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:58.410> turn<00:00:58.770> the<00:01:00.140> crank<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
will show you to turn the crank now is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.780 
will show you to turn the crank now is
it<00:01:02.070> important<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:02.940> took<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
it important that I also took the the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.050 
it important that I also took the the
the<00:01:05.790> magnets<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.560> rotor<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:08.610> here

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the magnets the the the rotor off here

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.230 
the magnets the the the rotor off here
so<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:11.130> three<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> nothing

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so I have I have three and nothing

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.450 
so I have I have three and nothing
should<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.689> binding<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.979> Craig<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
should be binding up but this Craig is

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.149 
should be binding up but this Craig is
also<00:01:14.760> binding<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.360> somewhere<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:22.159> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
also binding up somewhere that there is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
also binding up somewhere that there is
approximately<00:01:27.259> 180<00:01:28.259> degrees<00:01:29.180> turn<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:31.020> gonna

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
approximately 180 degrees turn I'm gonna

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.640 
approximately 180 degrees turn I'm gonna
mark<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> right<00:01:31.740> there

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.710 

give<00:01:35.650> me<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:36.479> reference<00:01:39.120> I'm<00:01:40.120> going<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.450> turn<00:01:40.600> it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
give me a reference I'm going to turn it

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.500 
give me a reference I'm going to turn it
again<00:01:41.020> slowly<00:01:41.440> as<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.430> can<00:01:42.550> see<00:01:45.300> it's<00:01:46.300> binding

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
again slowly as you can see it's binding

00:01:46.510 --> 00:02:00.209 
again slowly as you can see it's binding
up

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.880 

it's<00:02:00.670> almost<00:02:00.850> binding<00:02:01.450> up<00:02:01.600> at<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.840> same<00:02:02.259> area

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
it's almost binding up at the same area

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:12.780 
it's almost binding up at the same area
right<00:02:03.490> there

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.289 

there<00:02:13.790> was<00:02:13.939> showing<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.870> am<00:02:14.959> about

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:41.580 

23-thousand<00:02:23.299> south

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.390 

who<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.740> at<00:02:42.950> zero<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:45.400> actually

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
who it is at zero and it's actually

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.350 
who it is at zero and it's actually
bound<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.940> right<00:02:47.150> there<00:02:47.390> too<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.980> know

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
bound up right there too so you know

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.800 
bound up right there too so you know
right<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.660> zero<00:02:50.960> mark<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:53.450> where<00:02:53.690> it's

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
right for that zero mark is where it's

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.290 
right for that zero mark is where it's
finding<00:02:54.200> up<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:56.650> there<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.830> uh<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.240> the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
finding up so there is uh this is the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.530 
finding up so there is uh this is the
left<00:02:59.510> side<00:02:59.750> crank<00:03:00.170> one<00:03:00.410> out
