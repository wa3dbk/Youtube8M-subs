00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.800
 there was a mirror I think it's too bad 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.449
 just be waiting for a let it flow 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 what you are really like me 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.710
 I try not to mirror myself and nobody leaves 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 I know you wind up losing yourself 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 I did not want a woman, I do not think much. 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.279
 in my father I think I have a lot of what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 I like 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.030
 I like the same thing that I like 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.739
 a lot of touching the body 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.129
 I like the program my program only has 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.329
 people have people who are anonymous and who 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.329
 For there I love it. 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:52.900
 What was raised the thesis was and here 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.300
 had a shock in the chair a shock the 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.530
 Shock in my chair is kind of macho 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.320
 even though the woman is getting more 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.900
 old or too smart has a lot 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.970
 content such as maria gabriela 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.520
 the band an older woman on tv who 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.260
 It's cool, I think the woman's 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.250
 stay in theory a lot has done well 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:17.320
 deep enough content is paulo is 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.350
 very different from Brazil 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.710
 Brazil still has a lot of time to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.200
 less than 20 years of consumption 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.540
 quite the Internet by mobile phone that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.910
 I watch the series a lot and not on TV. 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.740
 those American TV series or grandmas 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.690
 to attend auditorium programs 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.780
 silva mouse program do not watch 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.780
 soap opera 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.220
 I like to see what 's going on. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.140
 happening in Brazil through 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.140
 auditorium programs 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.310
 even so will I ever do so 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.009

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.190
 It makes pump fame is that I let me but 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.400
