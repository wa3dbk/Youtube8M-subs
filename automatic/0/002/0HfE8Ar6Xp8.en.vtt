00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
all right so this is part two of the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.910 
all right so this is part two of the
video<00:00:04.790> for<00:00:06.350> USB<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.589> serial<00:00:07.940> communication<00:00:09.920> so

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
video for USB to serial communication so

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.020 
video for USB to serial communication so
these<00:00:11.340> are<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> two<00:00:12.290> USB<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.500> TTL<00:00:13.530> converter

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
these are the two USB to TTL converter

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.220 
these are the two USB to TTL converter
cybot<00:00:15.030> from<00:00:15.480> ebay<00:00:15.949> and<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.090> fcd<00:00:19.080> i'll

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
cybot from ebay and this the fcd i'll

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.590 
cybot from ebay and this the fcd i'll
sucking<00:00:19.710> them<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.890> however<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.359> one

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
sucking them out however this one

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.089 
sucking them out however this one
instead<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> these<00:00:23.519> um<00:00:24.500> male<00:00:25.500> pin<00:00:25.769> headers

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
instead of the these um male pin headers

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
instead of the these um male pin headers
as<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.910> pin<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.060> sub<00:00:30.060> D<00:00:30.710> nine

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
as an out pin out we have the sub D nine

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.870 
as an out pin out we have the sub D nine
pin<00:00:31.980> sub<00:00:32.309> D<00:00:32.520> connector<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.340> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> special

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
pin sub D connector so this is a special

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
pin sub D connector so this is a special
case<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:36.930> side<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
case but on the other side you have the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.720 
case but on the other side you have the
mini<00:00:38.670> USB<00:00:40.250> for<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.550> connector<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.540> PC<00:00:42.930> so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
mini USB for your connector your PC so

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.110 
mini USB for your connector your PC so
we<00:00:44.730> also<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.710> breadboard<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.910> need

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
we also have the breadboard and you need

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
we also have the breadboard and you need
six<00:00:48.480> jumper<00:00:49.320> wires<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.250> started<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
six jumper wires to get started so on

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
six jumper wires to get started so on
these<00:00:53.000> pin<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.829> you're<00:00:55.829> concerned<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.489> only

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
these pin out you're concerned with only

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.319 
these pin out you're concerned with only
the<00:00:57.449> t<00:00:58.609> XD<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.680> our<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:01.920> XD<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> also<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the t XD and our our XD and also the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.410 
the t XD and our our XD and also the
ground<00:01:03.539> goes<00:01:04.290> only<00:01:04.559> three<00:01:04.909> pin<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
ground goes only three pin out that you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.370 
ground goes only three pin out that you
need<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> let's<00:01:07.920> connect<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.229> I'll<00:01:10.229> use

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
need so let's connect them so I'll use

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.260 
need so let's connect them so I'll use
black<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.650> ground<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:16.640> TX<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:17.850> use<00:01:18.000> yellow

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
black for ground and TX I'll use yellow

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.710 
black for ground and TX I'll use yellow
keeping<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.720> color<00:01:22.530> code<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:22.860> each

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
keeping the same color code for each

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.530 
keeping the same color code for each
converter<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.990> help<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:26.030> get<00:01:27.030> things<00:01:27.270> set<00:01:27.509> up

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
converter can help you get things set up

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.380 
converter can help you get things set up
correctly<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> I've<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> first<00:01:30.180> one

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
correctly so I've got the first one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.670 
correctly so I've got the first one
finished<00:01:31.009> do<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> same<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> second<00:01:32.939> one

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.930 

Brown<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.960> RX<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:46.150> this<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.170> TX

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
Brown and this is the RX and this is TX

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.600 
Brown and this is the RX and this is TX
again<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.120> don't<00:01:49.210> need<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.660> connect<00:01:50.170> your

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
again you don't need to connect your

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.190 
again you don't need to connect your
handshake<00:01:51.610> or<00:01:51.940> anything<00:01:52.120> like<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:53.020> is

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
handshake or anything like that this is

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.820 
handshake or anything like that this is
all<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.440> need

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
all you need

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.590 
all you need
so<00:01:54.700> next<00:01:55.060> part<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.840> hook<00:01:56.830> up<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.600> USB

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
so next part is to hook up to the USB

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.500 
so next part is to hook up to the USB
port<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:02:00.610> just<00:02:00.790> using<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.710> USB<00:02:02.710> hub<00:02:02.740> to

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
port I'm just using the USB hub to

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.609 
port I'm just using the USB hub to
extend<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.660> number<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.280> comport<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.610> my<00:02:06.970> laptop

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
extend a number of comport on my laptop

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.889 
extend a number of comport on my laptop
so<00:02:08.619> hook<00:02:08.800> up<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.070> my<00:02:09.160> first<00:02:09.369> one<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:10.720> going

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so hook up to my first one you're going

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.470 
so hook up to my first one you're going
to<00:02:11.170> your<00:02:11.350> PC<00:02:11.800> should<00:02:12.160> detect<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:15.480> converter

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
to your PC should detect the converter

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.120 
to your PC should detect the converter
and<00:02:16.950> automatically<00:02:17.950> download<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.760> drivers

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
and automatically download the drivers

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.300 
and automatically download the drivers
for<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.480> will<00:02:22.570> have<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> driver<00:02:23.310> when

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
for it if you will have the driver when

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.820 
for it if you will have the driver when
you<00:02:24.520> purchase<00:02:24.910> your<00:02:25.500> converter<00:02:26.500> if<00:02:26.709> you're

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
you purchase your converter if you're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.620 
you purchase your converter if you're
coming<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.190> disc<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.820> can<00:02:27.970> convince<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
coming with a disc that can convince the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.520 
coming with a disc that can convince the
driver<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.000> hook<00:02:31.540> those<00:02:31.810> two<00:02:31.989> up<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.930> these<00:02:35.320> are

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
driver so hook those two up so these are

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.970 
driver so hook those two up so these are
two<00:02:35.739> separate<00:02:36.100> comport<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.440> I'll<00:02:38.650> hook<00:02:38.800> up

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
two separate comport now so I'll hook up

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.979 
two separate comport now so I'll hook up
the<00:02:39.100> ground<00:02:39.690> first<00:02:41.280> my<00:02:42.280> ground<00:02:42.610> should<00:02:42.940> be

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
the ground first my ground should be

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.199 
the ground first my ground should be
connected<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.170> same<00:02:45.130> ground<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:45.820> I<00:02:45.880> have<00:02:46.000> some

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
connected to same ground so I have some

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.130 
connected to same ground so I have some
ground<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.950> one<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.570> TX<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:51.310> first<00:02:51.549> TX

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
ground and this one the TX the first TX

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.530 
ground and this one the TX the first TX
should<00:02:53.140> connect<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.830> second<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:56.140> X<00:02:56.350> and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
should connect to the second or X and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.060 
should connect to the second or X and
vice<00:02:58.540> versa

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
vice versa

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.050 
vice versa
this<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:01.620> Rx<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.980> first<00:03:03.430> one<00:03:03.700> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
this is the Rx for the first one and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.630 
this is the Rx for the first one and
this<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.110> TX<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> second<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.870> okay<00:03:07.870> so

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
this is the TX for a second one okay so

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.370 
this is the TX for a second one okay so
