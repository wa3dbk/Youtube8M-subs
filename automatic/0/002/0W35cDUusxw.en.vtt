00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
very upsetting when I think about what

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.770 
very upsetting when I think about what
happened<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> her<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.350> realized<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:50.780> the

happened to her and realized that the

happened to her and realized that the
things<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.439> could<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.920> saved<00:01:53.159> her<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.270> not

it's<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.469> rocket<00:01:58.740> science<00:01:59.310> let's<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
it's not rocket science let's just do it
