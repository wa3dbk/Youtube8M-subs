00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.749
 what to do first video tutorial in which I say today would be quite simple 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.619
 Textures with filth can always be seen 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.050
 that's easy I have a Digest Clock for example now 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.329
 which does not open a bed 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.559
 with dogs that is now purely from agriculture to the Rathausmarkt 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.259
 nothing 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.529
 most common cause Stork 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.009
 which one likes that 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.830
 Here we leave the format 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.160
 completely avoid storing BMP 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.260
 if possible 24 bits 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 then open here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.100
 with Photoshop the BMP Natal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 there in the small moment 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 but simply import it via either open 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.040
 Open file via this 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.640
 or control Euro 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.410
 or move in excessively summer 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.890
 so let me know until 10 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.950
 then he goes to the lower right to new level 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.840
 he set a new level in the middle 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 For example, I am a background in her 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 make sure that driver and driver Schwarzer 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.830
 Once filled, Welters fills up the water and saves it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.420
 when it comes to filters 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.530
 christened Wörner Felser 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 bought club clouds and that should look like that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.510
 then he goes on Twitter 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.610
 Stylization Stelter 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 then he takes there once occupied 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.729
 one chose the values ​​angle 105 90 degrees 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.880
 12 fixes 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.970
 Strength 500 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.180
 goes on »explains 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.580
 you change the level mode to caution and you can already 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.010
 see 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.100
 It has changed a lot, that is, you can see beautiful here 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 that the red horse smith smeared stains is the drinktec 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.600
 enters texturing texture 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.150
 And so we still manage to find a bit of brown for that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.759
 control 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.829
 With that comes the hue saturation 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.939
 then click here on the bottom right on Earth 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.890
 you get up here in the color 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.430
 22 off 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 our goal for "What you want" of 20 and click on FM 11 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.229
 and if we always feel like crying now 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.289
 for example, the license plate 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.299
 you can see clear difference we do not see the text form to aliens 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.369
 from the dirt 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.039
 that is normal 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.039
 that is the Waldviertel way 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.900
 So I think you can with the two things then pretty good difference 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.129
 achieve 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.359
 we'll talk the texture now 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.359
 again as BMW 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.379
 also save 24-bit again 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.829
 then I always pull short unchanged 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.939
 if you look at the direct mandate 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.819
 "How the memorial will turn out 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.819
 under low text clock so there is some difference 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.939
 save something again as DRS 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.829
 and if here we have to release triggered normal stuff 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.539
 and save 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.239
 if now every text open clock 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.829
 you look nice 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 what you have now for this track texture 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.859
 you can use the Minetti game against text Schulz for example 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.229
 German Truck to the leader or as in other things 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.749
 and I hope you enjoyed it and wish you a lot of fun copying
