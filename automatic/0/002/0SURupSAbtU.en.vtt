00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.419
 We continue to release a loud opening 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.100
 American geologists say that 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.710
 discovered in the structure of the earth 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.300
 as many new layers of them 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 existence explains why 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.439
 earthquakes sometimes happen where 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 they should not be like 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.080
 I'm bringing up volcanoes now 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.329
 tell about everything more 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.640
 scientists have long established that in the process 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.159
 some crust movements 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.160
 lithospheric plates as if diving under 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:35.100
 other this phenomenon is called subduction 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.080
 usually everything happens so more subtle 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.230
 medium speed oceanic plates 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.720
 about five centimeters a year crawl 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 under the mainland it was previously believed that 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.810
 being at the mantle due to high 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.780
 temperatures 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.130
 thus drowned plot 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.020
 completely melted and lose 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.510
 initial properties however 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.790
 geologists from the University of Utah succeeded 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.650
 refute this theory exploring 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.650
 structure is real depths to 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.949
 one and a half thousand kilometers they discovered 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.840
 layers of heterogeneity where the density is 300 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.840
 times the background 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.179
 still have been concluded the remains of the ancients 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 continents disappeared as a result 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.119
 subduction 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.520
 can still drift flows 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.009
 magma periodically nudging from below 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 the upper shell of the earth provoking 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.439
 most earthquake as well as eruption 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.569
 volcanoes suspected splinters 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.340
 lithospheric plates especially active 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.009
 pile up under indonesia and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.990
 pacific coast of south america with 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.420
 this may be due to increased 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.569
 seismicity in the area we thought 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.909
 and what if somewhere near Moscow also 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.429
 drifting in the magma to the ancient mother and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.359
 someday it will turn back 9 ball 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.389
 earthquakes 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:51.179
 as Russian geologists say, so far 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.009
 technology does not allow to look so 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.679
 deep underground however 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.509
 experts doubt the possibility 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.549
 the existence of such threats 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.200
 because still all significant 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.420
 The earthquake in Moscow was only 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.029
 echoes of aftershocks 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.399
 the epicenter of which were on a huge 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:11.340
 away from the capital of our country all that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.319
 still rolled to moscow 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.859
 epicenter and these earthquakes were 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.069
 either in the Carpathians vranch zone 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:22.370
 a 78 earthquake or a couple 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.280
 years ago, Moscow has come down 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.639
 echoes of the Okhotsk earthquake 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.049
 sea and talk about some kind of seismicity 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:36.049
 in Moscow it is not worth doing
