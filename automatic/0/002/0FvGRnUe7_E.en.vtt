one screw in the corner and then you can

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.459 
one screw in the corner and then you can
lift<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.520> whole<00:00:35.850> plate<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
servo not being able to move but that's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
servo not being able to move but that's
not<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.640> case<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.570> piece<00:00:45.809> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
not the case it's actually a piece of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.060 
not the case it's actually a piece of

for one makes it leak fluid and for two

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.720 
for one makes it leak fluid and for two
just<00:02:25.959> does<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.319> make<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:26.920> overdrive<00:02:27.580> to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
just does not make it so overdrive to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.539 
just does not make it so overdrive to
lockup<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:29.099> that's<00:02:30.099> what<00:02:30.310> because<00:02:32.549> that

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
lockup so that's what because that

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.100 
lockup so that's what because that
little<00:02:33.730> $2<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.750> 77<00:02:35.410> Pisa<00:02:35.620> ring<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:37.480> acrosses

this<00:02:58.900> piece<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.110> pipe<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.799> I<00:03:00.549> jacked<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.060> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
this piece of pipe and I jacked it up so

this piece of pipe and I jacked it up so
it<00:03:01.360> compressed<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.230> servo<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.890> picked

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
it compressed the servo and then picked

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.690 
it compressed the servo and then picked
my<00:03:06.190> little<00:03:06.430> pliers<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:08.220> pull<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.370> what<00:03:09.579> was

a<00:03:55.320> little<00:03:55.500> bit<00:03:55.650> looks<00:03:55.890> like<00:03:56.040> from<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.600> just

a little bit looks like from the just
from<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> ring<00:03:57.989> breaking<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.500> but<00:04:01.370> hopefully

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
from the ring breaking up but hopefully

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.880 
from the ring breaking up but hopefully
that<00:04:03.209> takes<00:04:03.450> care<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:05.900> grabbed<00:04:06.900> 10<00:04:07.140> 10
