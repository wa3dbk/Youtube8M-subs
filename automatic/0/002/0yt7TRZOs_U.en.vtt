animations<00:00:16.760> is<00:00:18.289> accurate<00:00:19.310> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
animations is accurate this is the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
animations is accurate this is the
actual<00:00:20.970> animation<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> website<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
actual animation from the website so you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.080 
actual animation from the website so you
know<00:00:22.680> exactly<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.400> talking<00:00:23.430> about

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
know exactly what I'm talking about

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390 
know exactly what I'm talking about
the<00:00:24.930> reason<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.500> people<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.949> saying<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the reason that people are saying it is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
the reason that people are saying it is
not<00:00:26.519> accurate<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.150> because<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> looks<00:00:27.810> like

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
not accurate is because it looks like

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.859 
not accurate is because it looks like
the<00:00:28.140> bobbin<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.449> piece<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> holds

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the bobbin which is the piece that holds

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.020 
the bobbin which is the piece that holds
the<00:00:31.019> thread<00:00:31.529> underneath<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.130> fabric<00:00:32.279> it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the thread underneath the fabric it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.920 
the thread underneath the fabric it
looks<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.450> floating<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.780> space

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
looks like it's floating in space

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
looks like it's floating in space
because<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.860> needle<00:00:35.700> thread<00:00:35.940> goes<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
because the needle thread goes all the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.780 
because the needle thread goes all the
way<00:00:36.870> around<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.469> loops<00:00:38.129> around<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
way around it loops around it and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
way around it loops around it and
there's<00:00:39.690> no<00:00:39.809> possible<00:00:40.170> way<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> be

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there's no possible way for it to be

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
there's no possible way for it to be
attached<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> anything<00:00:41.340> there<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.750> gonna

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
attached to anything there is I'm gonna

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
attached to anything there is I'm gonna
show<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.200> using<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.890> real<00:00:44.010> sewing<00:00:44.250> machine

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
show you using a real sewing machine

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.880 
show you using a real sewing machine
parts<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.090> possible

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
parts how that's possible

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.090 
parts how that's possible
so<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:48.480> sewing<00:00:48.870> machine<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.530> using<00:00:49.800> for

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so the sewing machine that I'm using for

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
so the sewing machine that I'm using for
an<00:00:50.160> example<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.260> industrial<00:00:52.260> sewing

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
an example is a industrial sewing

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
an example is a industrial sewing
machine<00:00:52.949> home<00:00:53.190> machines<00:00:53.550> work<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> same

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
machine home machines work on the same

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.439 
machine home machines work on the same
principles<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.739> different

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
principles but a little different

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.139 
principles but a little different
technically<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.190> here's<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.460> underside<00:00:59.940> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
technically so here's the underside of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.990 
technically so here's the underside of
an<00:01:00.629> industrial<00:01:00.899> sewing<00:01:01.260> machine<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
an industrial sewing machine and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
an industrial sewing machine and
industrial<00:01:03.000> sewing<00:01:03.180> machine<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> one

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
industrial sewing machine is the one

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.000 
industrial sewing machine is the one
that<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:03.960> shown<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> animation<00:01:04.290> by<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that was shown in the animation by the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.270 
that was shown in the animation by the
way<00:01:05.159> typically<00:01:06.710> industrial<00:01:07.710> machine<00:01:08.010> bobbin

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
way typically industrial machine bobbin

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
way typically industrial machine bobbin
sit<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.790> hell<00:01:09.600> machine<00:01:09.900> bobbin<00:01:10.049> sit

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
sit like this hell machine bobbin sit

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.690 
sit like this hell machine bobbin sit
like<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.570> this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.080> better

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
like this and this is a little better

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.740 
like this and this is a little better
that's<00:01:14.700> why<00:01:14.820> they're<00:01:15.000> Industrial<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.659> why

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that's why they're Industrial that's why

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
that's why they're Industrial that's why
people<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.890> business<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.310> guess

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
people use them to the business I guess

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.910 
people use them to the business I guess
so<00:01:18.330> once<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.049> bobbin<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.770> doesn't

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so once your bobbin is in it doesn't

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
so once your bobbin is in it doesn't
move<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.350> bobbin

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
move this is going to be your bobbin

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.969 
move this is going to be your bobbin
case<00:01:23.330> inside<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> bobbin<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:26.280> thread<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
case inside is a bobbin with thread and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
case inside is a bobbin with thread and
you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> thread<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:29.939> see

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you can see the thread right there see

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can see the thread right there see
good<00:01:31.549> bobbin<00:01:32.549> sits<00:01:33.329> inside<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.840> bobbin<00:01:34.170> case

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
good bobbin sits inside the bobbin case

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
good bobbin sits inside the bobbin case
and<00:01:37.189> there's<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.520> guest<00:01:39.150> mower<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.630> fits

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and there's a little guest mower it fits

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
and there's a little guest mower it fits
through<00:01:40.110> no<00:01:40.320> big<00:01:40.470> deal<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.610> bobbin<00:01:42.210> case<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
through no big deal the bobbin case it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.880 
through no big deal the bobbin case it's
into<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.110> piece<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.649> should<00:01:43.799> be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
into this piece which should be

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
into this piece which should be
underneath<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.820> sewing<00:01:45.360> machine<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
underneath your sewing machine and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.940 
underneath your sewing machine and
typically<00:01:46.140> would<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.409> come<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.710> unless

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
typically would not come out unless

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.020 
typically would not come out unless
you're<00:01:47.100> getting<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.430> machine<00:01:47.520> serviced

you're getting your machine serviced

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.219 
you're getting your machine serviced
this<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.930> there

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
this it's in there

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
this it's in there
it<00:01:49.649> locks<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> place<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.369> never<00:01:50.579> moves<00:01:50.880> once

that's<00:01:53.640> attached<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> shaft<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> moves

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that's attached to a shaft that moves

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.080 
that's attached to a shaft that moves
and<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> goes<00:01:55.409> around<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> row<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.909> how

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and it goes around in a row right so how

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
and it goes around in a row right so how
in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> world<00:01:57.299> does<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.990> top<00:01:58.320> thread<00:01:58.619> which

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
in the world does the top thread which

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.179 
in the world does the top thread which
is<00:01:59.310> coming<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.909> from<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> needle<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> loop

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
is coming in from a needle to the loop

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.749 
is coming in from a needle to the loop
I'm<00:02:02.579> gonna<00:02:02.729> call<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.270> needles<00:02:04.259> rib<00:02:04.759> how

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
I'm gonna call this the needles rib how

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.389 
I'm gonna call this the needles rib how
does<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.899> behind<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.890> bobbin<00:02:08.190> casing

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
does that go behind the bobbin casing

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.880 
does that go behind the bobbin casing
then<00:02:09.090> loop<00:02:09.270> around<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> front<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
then loop around from the front and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.790 
then loop around from the front and
behind<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:12.810> grab

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
behind to grab

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520 
behind to grab
bottom<00:02:14.640> thread<00:02:14.790> well<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.410> right

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
bottom thread well if you look right

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.160 
bottom thread well if you look right
here<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> little<00:02:17.940> knowledge<00:02:18.270> now

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
here just do a little knowledge now

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
here just do a little knowledge now
that's<00:02:19.320> where<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.980> thread<00:02:20.580> will<00:02:20.760> go<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
that's where the thread will go and it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.770 
that's where the thread will go and it
comes<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.790> coming<00:02:23.790> around<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.390> outside

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
comes here and coming around the outside

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
comes here and coming around the outside
are<00:02:26.060> two<00:02:27.060> times<00:02:27.680> see<00:02:28.680> them<00:02:28.860> right<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:29.190> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
are two times see them right there so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.350 
are two times see them right there so
times<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:31.440> catch<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.950> thread<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:33.120> that

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
times will catch the thread like that

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.300 
times will catch the thread like that
and<00:02:34.320> let's<00:02:35.130> see<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.580> do<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:37.310> they

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and let's see if I can do this and they

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.260 
and let's see if I can do this and they
spin<00:02:38.670> around<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.240> timed<00:02:39.900> thing<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:42.030> they

the bottom thread right there catches it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.010 
the bottom thread right there catches it
lifts<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:14.070> through<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.030> hole<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.990> make

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
lifts it up and through the hole to make

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.040 
lifts it up and through the hole to make
a<00:03:16.170> loop<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.280> what<00:03:17.490> happens<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:20.120> there<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
a loop so what happens is there the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.650 
a loop so what happens is there the

shaft and this piece stay still because

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.370 
shaft and this piece stay still because
it<00:03:34.980> holds<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> bobbin<00:03:35.760> well<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.020> sits

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
it holds the bobbin well this sits

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.860 
it holds the bobbin well this sits
inside<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.250> using<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.970> tongue-and-groove

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
inside of this using a tongue-and-groove
method<00:03:40.590> there<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.870> piece<00:03:42.870> comes<00:03:43.590> around

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
method there is a piece comes around

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.100 
method there is a piece comes around
like<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.190> there's<00:03:45.060> an<00:03:45.209> opening<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.660> gap<00:03:45.870> just

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
like this there's an opening a gap just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.530 
like this there's an opening a gap just
like<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.440> my<00:03:46.590> fingers<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.360> comes

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
like with my fingers so this comes

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.150 
like with my fingers so this comes
around<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.410> fits<00:03:49.650> into<00:03:49.920> a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
around like this and it fits into a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.460 
around like this and it fits into a
groove<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.950> shiny<00:03:53.940> silver<00:03:54.270> piece<00:03:54.600> right

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
groove on the shiny silver piece right

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.199 
groove on the shiny silver piece right
here<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.830> see<00:03:56.010> how<00:03:56.160> one<00:03:56.459> one<00:03:56.820> is<00:03:56.910> kind<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
here you see how one one is kind of a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.030 
here you see how one one is kind of a
matte<00:03:57.360> silver<00:03:57.570> once<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.050> shiny<00:03:58.260> shiny

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
matte silver once it's shiny shiny

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.560 
matte silver once it's shiny shiny
silver<00:03:59.520> piece<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.270> part<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:01.490> stays<00:04:02.570> stay

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
silver piece is the part that stays stay

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.250 
silver piece is the part that stays stay
still<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:05.060> then<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.270> silver<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.959> piece

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
still and then that silver is a piece

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.000 
still and then that silver is a piece
that<00:04:07.590> moves<00:04:07.950> around<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:10.830> matte

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that moves around it and the matte

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.440 
that moves around it and the matte
silver<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.520> piece<00:04:11.670> with<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.000> groove<00:04:12.270> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
silver is a piece with the groove and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.690 
silver is a piece with the groove and
the<00:04:13.020> shiny<00:04:13.260> piece<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.430> with<00:04:14.580> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the shiny piece is the one with the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.370 
the shiny piece is the one with the
tongue<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.880> tongue<00:04:18.270> or<00:04:18.510> raised

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
tongue and the the tongue or raised

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.800 
tongue and the the tongue or raised
portion<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.549> sits<00:04:20.910> inside<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.359> groove<00:04:21.600> and

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
portion that sits inside the groove and

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.960 
portion that sits inside the groove and
and<00:04:22.320> holds<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.070> place<00:04:23.190> unless<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.790> spin

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
and holds it in place unless it spin

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.450 
and holds it in place unless it spin
around<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.330> round<00:04:24.540> has<00:04:25.169> an<00:04:25.560> opening<00:04:26.040> and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
around and round has an opening and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.530 
around and round has an opening and
let's<00:04:26.640> see<00:04:26.760> if<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.120> show<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.330> this

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
let's see if I can show you this

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.480 
let's see if I can show you this
to<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.830> right<00:04:29.520> here<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.770> see<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.190> this

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
to you so right here you see this this

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.960 
to you so right here you see this this
raised<00:04:33.240> portion<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:34.590> stops<00:04:36.440> right<00:04:37.440> there

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
raised portion it stops right there

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.090 
raised portion it stops right there
no<00:04:38.970> more<00:04:39.180> raised<00:04:39.360> portion<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.770> right<00:04:40.950> yeah

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
no more raised portion so right yeah

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.910 
no more raised portion so right yeah
it's<00:04:42.030> no<00:04:42.150> raised<00:04:42.390> portion<00:04:42.870> right<00:04:43.020> there<00:04:43.260> see

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
it's no raised portion right there see

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.100 
it's no raised portion right there see
there's<00:04:44.100> no<00:04:44.220> shine<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.700> then<00:04:45.540> right<00:04:45.900> there

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
there's no shine and then right there

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.140 
there's no shine and then right there
you<00:04:46.350> can<00:04:46.530> see<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.860> now<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.700> raised<00:04:47.910> portion

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
you can see that now the raised portion

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.070 
you can see that now the raised portion
starts<00:04:48.600> again<00:04:48.890> well<00:04:49.890> when<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.750> thread<00:04:51.750> gets

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
starts again well when the thread gets

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.480 
starts again well when the thread gets
caught<00:04:52.320> with<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.650> tines<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.160> time<00:04:53.370> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
caught with the tines the time to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.900 
caught with the tines the time to
separate<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.910> thread<00:04:54.240> then<00:04:54.810> one<00:04:55.590> side<00:04:55.910> goes

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
separate the thread then one side goes

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.400 
separate the thread then one side goes
in<00:04:57.240> front<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.690> bobbin<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.230> other

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
in front of the bobbin and the other

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.310 
in front of the bobbin and the other
side<00:04:58.800> gets<00:04:59.550> pulled<00:04:59.880> into<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.600> separation

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
side gets pulled into that separation

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.720 
side gets pulled into that separation
and<00:05:01.620> behind<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.520> bobbin<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:04.530> once<00:05:05.520> it

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
and behind the bobbin and then once it

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.580 
and behind the bobbin and then once it
goes<00:05:05.940> around<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.360> certain<00:05:06.630> point<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:07.260> piece

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
goes around to a certain point the piece

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.590 
goes around to a certain point the piece
behind<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.040> bobbin<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.430> released<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.060> they

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
behind the bobbin is released and they

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.260 
behind the bobbin is released and they
both<00:05:09.780> are<00:05:09.960> able<00:05:10.230> to<00:05:10.260> catch<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.130> come<00:05:12.090> back<00:05:12.210> up

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
both are able to catch and come back up

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.460 
both are able to catch and come back up
to<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.840> top<00:05:13.200> part<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.980> needle<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.750> this

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
to the top part of the needle so this

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.850 
to the top part of the needle so this
sits<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.040> kind<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.490> floats<00:05:17.820> inside<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.860> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
sits and kind of floats inside the the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.550 
sits and kind of floats inside the the
other<00:05:20.040> mail<00:05:20.250> case<00:05:20.580> you<00:05:21.480> can<00:05:21.630> hold<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.380> piece<00:05:22.530> of

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
other mail case you can hold a piece of

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.840 
other mail case you can hold a piece of
paper<00:05:22.860> up<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.400> can<00:05:23.550> see<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:24.510> color<00:05:25.850> you

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
paper up so you can see the color you

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.560 
paper up so you can see the color you
see<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.260> area<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:29.300> where<00:05:30.300> it's

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
see that so that area is where it's

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.710 
see that so that area is where it's
floating<00:05:31.550> just<00:05:32.550> spins<00:05:32.910> inside<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.540> their

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
floating just spins inside of their

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.260 
floating just spins inside of their
spending<00:05:34.380> inside<00:05:34.740> so<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.820> is<00:05:35.940> kind<00:05:36.180> of

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
spending inside so it is kind of

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.970 
spending inside so it is kind of
floating<00:05:36.570> in<00:05:36.630> space<00:05:36.780> but<00:05:37.440> not<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.830> way<00:05:37.920> you

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
floating in space but not the way you

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.420 
floating in space but not the way you
think<00:05:38.250> it<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.520> it's<00:05:38.850> a<00:05:39.240> very<00:05:40.430> intelligent

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
think it is it's a very intelligent

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.950 
think it is it's a very intelligent
mechanical<00:05:42.000> approach<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:44.720> complicated<00:05:45.720> and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
mechanical approach to a complicated and

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.770 
mechanical approach to a complicated and
long<00:05:46.800> hand-done<00:05:47.400> problem<00:05:47.790> think<00:05:48.480> of<00:05:48.660> a

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
long hand-done problem think of a

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.840 
long hand-done problem think of a
mechanical<00:05:49.230> revolution<00:05:49.800> so<00:05:50.460> that's<00:05:50.610> how<00:05:50.760> it

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
mechanical revolution so that's how it

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.490 
mechanical revolution so that's how it
works<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.450> I<00:05:51.750> hope<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:52.080> have<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.350> better

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
works and I hope you have a better

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.420 
works and I hope you have a better
understanding<00:05:52.620> now<00:05:53.160> thanks<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.060> lot<00:05:54.180> bye
