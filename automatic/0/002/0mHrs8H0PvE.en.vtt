rather<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.340> there's<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.030> arch

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
rather like that and there's that arch

rather like that and there's that arch
right<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.959> much<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> might<00:02:10.830> even<00:02:10.950> be

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
right it's not much I might even be

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
but it's also going to take a little

little and move them up and you'll get

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.790 
little and move them up and you'll get
that<00:02:40.640> chord<00:02:40.940> again<00:02:41.090> right<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.840> off<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.650> put

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
that chord again right and off and put

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.970 
that chord again right and off and put
it<00:02:42.830> back<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.450> regain<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.630> arch<00:02:44.840> keep<00:02:45.650> doing

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
it back and regain the arch keep doing

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.650 
it back and regain the arch keep doing
it<00:02:46.100> until<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.459> arch<00:02:46.670> becomes<00:02:47.060> automatic

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
it until that arch becomes automatic

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.620 
it until that arch becomes automatic
okay<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.070> from<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:49.730> quite<00:02:50.030> easy<00:02:50.270> let's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
opposed to like that a little more

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.790 
opposed to like that a little more
parallel<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.959> same<00:03:15.170> thing<00:03:15.380> look<00:03:15.560> at<00:03:15.620> that

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
parallel and the same thing look at that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.410 
parallel and the same thing look at that
arch<00:03:16.010> I've<00:03:16.250> got<00:03:16.430> right<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.940> you're<00:03:17.209> finding

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
arch I've got right if you're finding

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.670 
arch I've got right if you're finding
there's<00:03:17.720> no<00:03:17.840> arch<00:03:18.049> like<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.410> you're<00:03:18.590> going

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
there's no arch like this you're going

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.039 
there's no arch like this you're going
to<00:03:18.739> be<00:03:18.830> muting<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.250> strings<00:03:19.400> behind<00:03:19.989> okay<00:03:20.989> so

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
to be muting the strings behind okay so

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.539 
to be muting the strings behind okay so
what<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.410> really<00:03:21.560> want<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.890> do<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.160> move<00:03:22.340> that

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
what you really want to do is move that

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.940 
what you really want to do is move that
finger<00:03:22.730> down<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.090> little<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.660> move<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.260> up<00:03:24.380> and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
finger down a little and move it up and

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.289 
finger down a little and move it up and
make<00:03:25.190> sure<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.489> little<00:03:25.700> more<00:03:25.790> parallel<00:03:26.209> as

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
make sure it's a little more parallel as

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.509 
make sure it's a little more parallel as
opposed<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.200> that's<00:03:27.920> how

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
opposed to like that and that's how

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.009 
opposed to like that and that's how
we're<00:03:28.700> going<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.880> get<00:03:29.060> all<00:03:29.299> of<00:03:29.330> our<00:03:29.570> arches

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
we're going to get all of our arches

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.509 
we're going to get all of our arches
same<00:03:30.680> thing<00:03:30.830> would<00:03:30.950> apply<00:03:30.980> here<00:03:31.190> you're<00:03:31.430> going

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
same thing would apply here you're going

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.090 
same thing would apply here you're going
to<00:03:31.610> lift<00:03:31.760> off<00:03:31.970> put<00:03:32.780> back<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.650> your<00:03:33.739> fingers<00:03:34.070> are

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
to lift off put back if your fingers are

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.160 
to lift off put back if your fingers are
off<00:03:34.489> again<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.420> okay<00:03:35.600> just<00:03:35.630> remember<00:03:35.900> what<00:03:36.110> I

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
off again so okay just remember what I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.810 
off again so okay just remember what I
told<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.530> make<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.890> more<00:03:37.040> parallel<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.730> the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
told you make it more parallel to the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.770 
told you make it more parallel to the
metal<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.239> frets

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
metal to the frets

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.960 
metal to the frets
okay<00:03:39.470> move<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.220> down<00:03:40.430> move<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.180> up

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.670 

okay<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:45.530> if<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.880> terminology<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.410> not

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
okay so if the terminology here is not

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.770 
okay so if the terminology here is not
clear<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.310> okay<00:03:49.640> I've<00:03:49.880> got<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.360> video<00:03:50.660> that

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
clear to you okay I've got a video that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.230 
clear to you okay I've got a video that
shows<00:03:51.020> you<00:03:51.260> how<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:51.650> hold<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.160> guitar<00:03:52.310> how<00:03:53.180> we

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
shows you how we hold the guitar how we

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.890 
shows you how we hold the guitar how we
are<00:03:54.020> supposed<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.860> hold<00:03:55.310> our<00:03:55.550> chords<00:03:55.970> okay<00:03:56.600> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
are supposed to hold our chords okay and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.420 
are supposed to hold our chords okay and
it<00:03:57.110> also<00:03:57.260> explains<00:03:57.680> how<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:57.950> read<00:03:58.130> chord

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
it also explains how to read chord

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.290 
it also explains how to read chord
diagrams<00:03:59.380> so<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:01.430> can<00:04:01.580> take<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.790> look<00:04:01.970> at<00:04:02.120> that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
diagrams so you can take a look at that

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.790 
diagrams so you can take a look at that
and<00:04:02.510> then<00:04:02.630> come<00:04:02.780> back<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.990> this<00:04:03.320> but<00:04:03.590> you're

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
and then come back to this but you're

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.170 
and then come back to this but you're
going<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.980> want<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.220> apply<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:04.460> arching

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
going to want to apply this arching

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.260 
going to want to apply this arching
method<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.660> all<00:04:05.810> your<00:04:06.050> chords<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:07.370> make<00:04:08.090> it

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
method to all your chords and make it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.850 
method to all your chords and make it
consistent<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:08.900> get<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.170> muscle<00:04:09.500> memory<00:04:09.530> for

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
consistent and get the muscle memory for

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.470 
consistent and get the muscle memory for
all<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.220> because<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:11.060> know<00:04:11.120> when<00:04:11.240> we<00:04:11.360> get

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
all of it because you know when we get

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.740 
all of it because you know when we get
to<00:04:11.600> more<00:04:12.640> more<00:04:13.640> complicated<00:04:14.270> chords<00:04:14.570> right

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
to more more complicated chords right

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.570 
to more more complicated chords right
arching<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.410> extremely<00:04:15.980> important<00:04:16.430> it's

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
arching is extremely important it's

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.530 
arching is extremely important it's
always<00:04:16.880> important<00:04:17.359> without<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:19.359> without<00:04:20.359> it

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
always important without it without it

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.690 
always important without it without it
