00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
put it in the middle of the wheel and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.440 
put it in the middle of the wheel and
just<00:00:46.309> just<00:00:47.309> tap<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> until<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.090> gets<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> the

middle okay there's no special formula
or<00:00:52.800> technique<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.760> other<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:58.879> just

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
or technique for that other than just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
or technique for that other than just
just<00:01:00.420> tap<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:00.989> fingers<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
helps put one finger on on the base of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.490 
helps put one finger on on the base of
the<00:01:04.830> pot<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:05.939> just

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
the pot there like that and then just

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.100 
the pot there like that and then just
just<00:01:07.500> gently<00:01:07.830> tap<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> you'll<00:01:08.580> find<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.380> um

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
just gently tap it and you'll find it um

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.240 
just gently tap it and you'll find it um
you'll<00:01:13.110> find<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.950> random

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you'll find if you just do random

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
you'll find if you just do random
tapping<00:01:15.000> quick<00:01:15.360> tapping<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.170> you'll

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
tapping quick tapping like that you'll

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.820 
tapping quick tapping like that you'll
find<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:17.790> does<00:01:17.939> pop<00:01:18.150> we'll<00:01:21.470> see<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:22.710> put

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
find it does pop we'll see I could put

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
find it does pop we'll see I could put
it<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.570> just<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:24.900> there

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.160 

all<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:32.990> again

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.890 

all<00:01:41.979> right<00:01:42.100> now<00:01:42.850> at<00:01:42.970> first<00:01:43.150> when<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.570> do<00:01:43.750> it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
all right now at first when you do it

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.660 
all right now at first when you do it
you'll<00:01:44.049> probably<00:01:44.200> go<00:01:44.560> low<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:48.369> worry<00:01:48.549> if

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you'll probably go low don't worry if

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.520 
you'll probably go low don't worry if
you<00:01:48.729> do<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:49.810> means<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.200> hit<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.409> too

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530

banding<00:01:59.740> wheel<00:01:59.890> if<00:02:00.070> you're<00:02:00.159> decorating<00:02:01.799> put

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
banding wheel if you're decorating put

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.920 
banding wheel if you're decorating put
your<00:02:02.950> pot<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.430> wheel<00:02:03.549> on<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.450> banding

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
your pot on the wheel on the banding

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.380 
your pot on the wheel on the banding
wheel<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.350> just<00:02:06.270> give<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.299> random<00:02:07.869> taps<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
wheel and just give it random taps to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.930 
wheel and just give it random taps to
things<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.840> would<00:02:10.959> say<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.349> number<00:02:11.980> one<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
things I would say is number one is it

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.640 
things I would say is number one is it
is<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.239> knack<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.230> will<00:02:14.730> find<00:02:15.730> that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
is a knack and you will find that

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.000 
is a knack and you will find that
initially<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.910> defies<00:02:19.510> logic<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.830> intellect

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
initially it defies logic and intellect

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.280 
initially it defies logic and intellect
as<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.459> were<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.269> don't<00:02:22.510> worry<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:23.170> it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
as it were but don't worry just do it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.470 
as it were but don't worry just do it
anyway<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.920> keep<00:02:24.250> tapping<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.850> pot<00:02:25.120> you'll

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
anyway just keep tapping that pot you'll

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.860 
anyway just keep tapping that pot you'll
find<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.140> will<00:02:26.230> get<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.680> center<00:02:27.069> okay<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
find that it will get on center okay and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.539 
find that it will get on center okay and
it'll<00:02:32.080> save<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.440> such<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> lot<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.010> time<00:02:33.250> you

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
it'll save you such a lot of time you

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.500 
it'll save you such a lot of time you
know<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.810> know<00:02:35.380> people<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.920> there<00:02:36.510> they're
