go one of the things to look for in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.609 
go one of the things to look for in
geocaching<00:01:13.710> our<00:01:13.979> trails<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
geocaching our trails like this one and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.330 
geocaching our trails like this one and
that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.849 
that
these<00:01:17.850> might<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.479> been<00:01:18.719> caused<00:01:18.990> by<00:01:19.229> another

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
these might have been caused by another

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.480 
these might have been caused by another
geocacher<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.600> coming<00:01:22.109> in<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.590> find<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.250> cash

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
geocacher for coming in to find the cash

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
geocacher for coming in to find the cash
or<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.179> could<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.479> been<00:01:24.689> caused<00:01:24.960> naturally

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
or they could have been caused naturally

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.740 
or they could have been caused naturally
but<00:01:26.189> either<00:01:26.399> way<00:01:26.789> they<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.719> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
but either way they make a good way to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.480 
but either way they make a good way to
enter<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.439> woods<00:01:28.939> by<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.979> 182<00:01:31.979> feet

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
enter the woods by now we're at 182 feet

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:53.929 
enter the woods by now we're at 182 feet
and<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.869> pointing<00:01:34.229> directly<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.549> way

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.569 

we've<00:01:54.939> reached<00:01:55.210> 45<00:01:55.930> feet<00:01:56.289> by<00:01:56.950> now<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.189> should

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
we've reached 45 feet by now you should

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.760 
we've reached 45 feet by now you should
be<00:01:57.610> looking<00:01:57.969> around<00:01:58.299> looking<00:01:58.840> for<00:01:59.079> thing<00:01:59.469> and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
be looking around looking for thing and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.480 
be looking around looking for thing and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
says that seemed out of the ordinary

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.179 
says that seemed out of the ordinary
yeah<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.610> pile<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.479> sticks<00:02:04.960> placed<00:02:05.439> in<00:02:05.770> just<00:02:06.009> the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
yeah a pile of sticks placed in just the

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.419 
yeah a pile of sticks placed in just the
perfect<00:02:06.490> way<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.939> hide<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.299> container<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.950> maybe

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
perfect way to hide a container or maybe

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.809 
perfect way to hide a container or maybe
a<00:02:09.640> hollow<00:02:10.239> wall<00:02:10.810> cook<00:02:11.230> right<00:02:11.830> next<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
a hollow wall cook right next to the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.920 
a hollow wall cook right next to the
Hornets<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:14.470> ugly<00:02:15.030> look<00:02:16.030> around<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
Hornets that's ugly look around if you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:26.400 
Hornets that's ugly look around if you
can<00:02:17.110> see<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.769> see<00:02:18.220> anything<00:02:18.700> let's<00:02:19.209> go<00:02:25.410> 16

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
can see you see anything let's go 16

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.470 
can see you see anything let's go 16
feet<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:28.660> at<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.440> point<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.400> time<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
feet you get at this point in and time I

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.479 
feet you get at this point in and time I
there<00:02:31.840> will<00:02:32.049> be<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> little<00:02:32.500> bounce<00:02:32.890> from<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
there will be a little bounce from the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.580 
there will be a little bounce from the
trees<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.360> coordinates<00:02:34.900> won't<00:02:35.230> be

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
trees and the coordinates won't be

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.520 
trees and the coordinates won't be
exactly<00:02:36.040> spot<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.910> accurate<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.170> should

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
exactly spot on accurate so you should

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.640 
exactly spot on accurate so you should
look<00:02:38.890> around<00:02:39.069> for<00:02:39.819> anything<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.870> might<00:02:41.290> give

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
look around for anything that might give

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.350 
look around for anything that might give
away<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.920> container<00:02:43.380> all<00:02:44.380> right<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.209> yeah<00:02:46.209> I

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
away a container all right I yeah I

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.780 
away a container all right I yeah I
think<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.870> might<00:02:47.079> have<00:02:47.110> found<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.459> pile

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
think I might have found it in this pile

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.890 
think I might have found it in this pile
of<00:02:49.090> logs<00:02:49.420> right<00:02:49.930> here<00:02:50.819> early<00:02:51.819> it's<00:02:52.150> not<00:02:52.360> look

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
of logs right here early it's not look

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.830 
of logs right here early it's not look
suspicious<00:02:53.440> out<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.400> ordinary<00:02:54.730> he<00:02:55.569> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
suspicious out of the ordinary he and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.930 
suspicious out of the ordinary he and
bachelor<00:02:56.319> areas<00:02:56.739> just<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.250> right<00:02:57.400> size<00:02:57.670> for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
bachelor areas just the right size for

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.520 
bachelor areas just the right size for
continued<00:02:58.540> things<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.709> a<00:03:00.130> little<00:03:00.280> cash<00:03:01.530> so

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
continued things just a little cash so

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:15.750 
continued things just a little cash so
let's<00:03:02.769> see

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.240 

this<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.940> an<00:03:17.090> ammo<00:03:17.450> box<00:03:17.480> pack<00:03:18.170> one<00:03:18.799> of<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.040> most

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
this is an ammo box pack one of the most
