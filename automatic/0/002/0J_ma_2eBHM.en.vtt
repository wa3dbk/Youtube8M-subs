huge clunky microphones that fell out of
favor<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> early<00:00:37.800> sixties<00:00:38.899> which<00:00:39.899> they

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
favor in the early sixties which they

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
favor in the early sixties which they
had<00:00:40.350> except<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.890> rib<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.610> engineers<00:00:41.940> who

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
understood what a ribbon microphone does

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.610 
understood what a ribbon microphone does
essentially<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.570> ribbons<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.290> they<00:00:46.410> hear

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
essentially what ribbons do is they hear

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380 
essentially what ribbons do is they hear
things<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.610> ears<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.030> than<00:00:48.210> any

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
things more like your ears do than any

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.959 
things more like your ears do than any
other<00:00:48.600> kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> microphone<00:00:50.510> if<00:00:51.510> you've<00:00:51.690> got<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
other kind of microphone if you've got a

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.250 
other kind of microphone if you've got a
trumpet<00:00:53.969> player<00:00:54.000> who's<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.719> playing<00:00:54.960> some

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
trumpet player who's just playing some

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
trumpet player who's just playing some
sweet<00:00:55.590> stuff<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> wrong<00:00:57.180> mic<00:00:57.449> on

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
sweet stuff and you put the wrong mic on

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.240 
sweet stuff and you put the wrong mic on
that<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.079> trumpet<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.980> something

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that that trumpet you can have something

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.720 
that that trumpet you can have something
very<00:00:59.370> aggressive<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> harsh<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.110> highs

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
very aggressive and harsh in the highs

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.590 
very aggressive and harsh in the highs
that's<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> way<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> microphone<00:01:03.210> will

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that's the way the microphone will

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.969 
that's the way the microphone will
translate<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> instrument<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> same<00:01:04.860> with

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
translate that instrument the same with

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.539 
translate that instrument the same with
electric<00:01:05.339> guitar<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.990> did<00:01:06.990> quite<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
electric guitar I did quite a bit of

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.120 
electric guitar I did quite a bit of
studio<00:01:08.549> work<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.540> guitarist<00:01:09.960> years<00:01:10.680> ago<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
studio work as a guitarist years ago and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.500 
studio work as a guitarist years ago and
I<00:01:11.159> used<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> love<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> sound<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.150> front<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> my

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I used to love the sound in front of my

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.420 
I used to love the sound in front of my
amp<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.500> I'd<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.740> into<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> studio

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
amp and then when I'd go into the studio

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
amp and then when I'd go into the studio
into<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> control<00:01:15.479> room<00:01:15.510> it<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.170> what

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
into the control room it was like what

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.250 
into the control room it was like what
happened<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.490> sound<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> ribbon

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
happened to that sound what a ribbon

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.899 
happened to that sound what a ribbon
microphone<00:01:19.770> does<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> good<00:01:20.670> ribbon

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
microphone does what a good ribbon

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.270 
microphone does what a good ribbon
microphone<00:01:21.299> does<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.409> translates<00:01:23.009> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
microphone does is it translates that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.820 
microphone does is it translates that
sound<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.790> naturally<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.750> any<00:01:25.140> microphone<00:01:25.650> out

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
sound is naturally as any microphone out

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.330 
sound is naturally as any microphone out
there<00:01:26.040> ever<00:01:26.189> will<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:27.799> within<00:01:28.799> two<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.189> three

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
there ever will it's within two or three

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
there ever will it's within two or three
moves<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.479> two<00:01:30.840> three<00:01:31.110> four<00:01:31.439> minutes<00:01:31.619> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
moves maybe two three four minutes of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.999 
moves maybe two three four minutes of
just<00:01:32.189> adjusting<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.939> position<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> mic

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
just adjusting the position of the mic

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.219 
just adjusting the position of the mic
you<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.280> hear<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> control<00:01:36.780> room<00:01:36.810> what

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you will hear in the control room what

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
you will hear in the control room what
it<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.650> hearing<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> amplifier

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it is you're hearing at the amplifier

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
it is you're hearing at the amplifier
which<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.060> tremendous<00:01:39.540> experience<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
which is a tremendous experience for a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.660 
which is a tremendous experience for a
guitarist<00:01:41.869> who's<00:01:42.869> -<00:01:43.049> who's<00:01:43.350> spent<00:01:44.130> thousands

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
guitarist who's - who's spent thousands

guitarist who's - who's spent thousands
on<00:01:44.820> guitars<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> amplifiers<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.229> really

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
on guitars and amplifiers and really

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
on guitars and amplifiers and really
developed<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> tone<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.430> tweaked<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
developed that tone and tweaked it and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
developed that tone and tweaked it and
found<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> settings<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:49.770> most

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
found the settings that that are most

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.280 
found the settings that that are most
pleasing<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.079> just
