wants everything to go now what doesn't
work<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.729> pacing<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:28.020> weird

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
work about it the pacing is a bit weird

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
work about it the pacing is a bit weird
it<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:28.979> faster<00:01:29.430> point<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.759> almost

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
it can be very faster point and almost

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
it can be very faster point and almost
feel<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.420> skimming<00:01:31.020> over<00:01:31.290> certain

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
feel like it's skimming over certain

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.600 
feel like it's skimming over certain
details<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.400> cut<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
details but then it will cut to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.980 
details but then it will cut to
something<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:32.939> quite<00:01:33.210> slow<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.869> can

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
something that's quite slow and this can

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.120 
something that's quite slow and this can
actually<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.560> distracting<00:01:35.040> or

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
actually be a bit distracting or

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually be a bit distracting or
uncomfortable<00:01:35.430> no<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> did<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> script

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
uncomfortable no I did like the script

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.789 
uncomfortable no I did like the script
but<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.810> stronger<00:01:37.200> towards<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> start

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
but it was stronger towards the start

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.080 
but it was stronger towards the start
and<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> went<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> became<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.759> bit<00:01:38.939> more

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and as it went on it became a bit more

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
and as it went on it became a bit more
formulaic<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.900> could<00:01:40.079> predict<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.560> was

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
formulaic you could predict what was

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.319 
formulaic you could predict what was
gonna<00:01:40.799> happen<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.490> knew<00:01:41.670> how<00:01:41.850> each<00:01:41.970> scene<00:01:42.210> was

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
gonna happen I knew how each scene was

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.490 
gonna happen I knew how each scene was
gonna<00:01:42.450> end<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.020> also<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
gonna end but that was also because of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
gonna end but that was also because of
the<00:01:43.560> trailers<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.100> watch<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> trailers<00:01:44.970> if

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the trailers don't watch the trailers if

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.310 
the trailers don't watch the trailers if
I<00:01:45.270> hadn't<00:01:45.509> watched<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> things<00:01:46.229> that

I hadn't watched all the things that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.630 
I hadn't watched all the things that
Sony<00:01:46.530> released<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.100> film<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.549> have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
Sony released in this film I would have

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
Sony released in this film I would have
been<00:01:47.729> impressed<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.750> stuff<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.420 
the trailer a lot of people have been
complaining<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> lizard<00:01:52.920> saying<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
complaining about the lizard saying that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.010

he's<00:01:53.640> underused<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.479> developed<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
he's underused or and developed but I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.969 
he's underused or and developed but I
didn't<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> problem<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
didn't really have a problem with that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
didn't really have a problem with that
he<00:01:56.219> facilitated<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> role<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> villain

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
he facilitated the role of the villain

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
he facilitated the role of the villain
that's<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.200> wanted<00:01:58.469> from<00:01:58.619> him<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> wanted
