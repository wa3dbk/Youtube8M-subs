in terms of style however it is
unoffensive<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.420> slightly<00:03:31.810> bland<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:33.159> I

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
unoffensive but slightly bland but I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.890 
unoffensive but slightly bland but I
must<00:03:33.519> say<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.970> does<00:03:34.180> look<00:03:34.420> better<00:03:34.689> than

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
must say that it does look better than

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.929

a<00:03:56.260> coot<00:03:56.890> kind<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:58.319> but<00:03:59.319> on<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.620> front<00:03:59.829> it<00:04:00.069> still

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
a coot kind of but on the front it still

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.819 
a coot kind of but on the front it still
looks<00:04:00.579> as<00:04:00.760> messy<00:04:01.209> as<00:04:01.239> before<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:02.530> all<00:04:02.709> these

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
looks as messy as before of all these

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.240 
looks as messy as before of all these
logos<00:04:03.390> dotted<00:04:04.390> about<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:05.799> looks<00:04:05.980> about<00:04:06.190> as

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
logos dotted about it looks about as

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.869 
logos dotted about it looks about as
tasteful<00:04:06.879> as<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.359> football<00:04:07.900> shirt<00:04:08.670> it's<00:04:09.670> nice

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
tasteful as a football shirt it's nice

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.190 
tasteful as a football shirt it's nice
that<00:04:09.909> they've<00:04:10.209> done<00:04:10.450> away<00:04:10.569> with<00:04:10.870> some<00:04:11.079> of<00:04:11.109> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
that they've done away with some of the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.680 
that they've done away with some of the
buttons<00:04:11.379> on<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.739> back<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.370> camera<00:04:12.690> but

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
buttons on the back of the camera but

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.119 
buttons on the back of the camera but
unfortunately<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.319> touchscreen<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.980> not

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
unfortunately the touchscreen is not

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.000 
unfortunately the touchscreen is not
perfect<00:04:15.700> especially<00:04:16.329> in<00:04:16.600> playback<00:04:16.989> mode<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
perfect especially in playback mode the

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.129 
perfect especially in playback mode the
trouble<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.789> it's<00:04:19.060> not<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:19.720> sensitive

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
trouble is is that it's not so sensitive

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.580 
trouble is is that it's not so sensitive
to<00:04:20.560> touch<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.579> really<00:04:21.850> have<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.000> poke<00:04:22.270> it

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
to touch so you really have to poke it

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.610 
to touch so you really have to poke it
in<00:04:23.590> order<00:04:24.210> for<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.270> to

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.580 

and<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:32.180> go<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.509> next<00:04:32.750> picture<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.080> swipe

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
and to go to the next picture you swipe

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.270 
and to go to the next picture you swipe
bit<00:04:34.250> like<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.580> iPhone<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.919> sometimes<00:04:36.919> when

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
bit like the iPhone and sometimes when

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.469 
bit like the iPhone and sometimes when
you're<00:04:37.400> trying<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.729> move<00:04:38.000> to<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.300> next

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
you're trying to move to the next

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.020 
you're trying to move to the next
picture<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:39.280> think<00:04:40.280> she<00:04:40.430> was<00:04:40.520> trying<00:04:40.699> to<00:04:40.880> zoom

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
picture I think she was trying to zoom

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.050 
picture I think she was trying to zoom
in<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:42.530> now<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.830> can't<00:04:43.160> do<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.430> pinchy<00:04:43.789> thing

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
in and now you can't do the pinchy thing

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.779 
in and now you can't do the pinchy thing
oh<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:45.500> will<00:04:45.740> expect<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.099> move<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.460> pictures

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
oh I will expect to move the pictures

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.230 
oh I will expect to move the pictures
like<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.150> no<00:04:47.990> doesn't<00:04:48.759> but<00:04:49.759> luckily<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.090> can

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
like that no doesn't but luckily you can

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.279 
like that no doesn't but luckily you can
still<00:04:50.479> use<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:51.199> directional<00:04:51.770> buttons<00:04:51.830> here

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
still use the directional buttons here

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.350 
still use the directional buttons here
which<00:04:54.289> means<00:04:54.699> Panasonic<00:04:55.699> didn't<00:04:55.940> really<00:04:56.210> need

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
which means Panasonic didn't really need

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.980 
which means Panasonic didn't really need
to<00:04:56.569> give<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.900> touchscreen<00:04:57.759> and<00:04:58.990> honestly

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
to give you a touchscreen and honestly

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.779 
to give you a touchscreen and honestly
you<00:05:00.349> can<00:05:00.530> still<00:05:00.740> zoom<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:04.330> our<00:05:05.330> season<00:05:06.020> two

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
you can still zoom in our season two

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.890 
you can still zoom in our season two
you've<00:05:07.789> got<00:05:07.820> plenty<00:05:08.090> more<00:05:08.330> construction
