that it's not by to win and whether or

that it's not by to win and whether or
not<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:34.860> true<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.519> really<00:03:36.239> up<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730

and all the people that wanted to try it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.119 
and all the people that wanted to try it
and<00:04:04.670> watching<00:04:05.480> from<00:04:05.599> the<00:04:05.750> outside<00:04:06.200> are<00:04:06.620> going

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
and watching from the outside are going

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.210 
and watching from the outside are going
to<00:04:07.430> jump<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.239> at<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.780> opportunity<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:09.890> we're

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
to jump in at the opportunity so we're

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.449 
to jump in at the opportunity so we're
going<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.519> have<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.700> lot<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.269> role<00:04:11.540> players<00:04:11.810> and

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
going to have a lot of role players and

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.240 
going to have a lot of role players and
I<00:04:13.459> imagine<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.569> many<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.470> them<00:04:15.650> will<00:04:15.950> not

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
I imagine that many of them will not

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.430 
I imagine that many of them will not
stick<00:04:16.579> around<00:04:16.639> for<00:04:17.150> very<00:04:17.299> long<00:04:17.419> because<00:04:18.139> you

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
stick around for very long because you

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.469 
stick around for very long because you
have<00:04:18.620> people<00:04:19.070> who<00:04:19.250> hop<00:04:19.609> from<00:04:19.850> game<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.120> game<00:04:20.299> a

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
have people who hop from game to game a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.860 
have people who hop from game to game a
lot<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.650> think<00:04:21.739> that<00:04:22.510> people<00:04:23.510> are<00:04:23.600> going<00:04:23.750> to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
lot and I think that people are going to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.600 
lot and I think that people are going to
see<00:04:24.050> this<00:04:24.169> as<00:04:24.229> an<00:04:24.500> opportunity<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:25.130> check<00:04:25.460> out

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
see this as an opportunity to check out

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.340 
see this as an opportunity to check out
the<00:04:25.760> role<00:04:25.940> play<00:04:26.120> community<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.780> some<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.229> them

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
the role play community and some of them

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.680 
the role play community and some of them
will<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.040> stay<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.580> some<00:04:29.360> won't

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
will like it and stay and some won't

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.020 
will like it and stay and some won't
like<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.080> game<00:04:30.290> or<00:04:30.590> there<00:04:31.250> will<00:04:31.430> be<00:04:31.610> something

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
like the game or there will be something

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.990 
like the game or there will be something
else<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.570> catches<00:04:32.720> their<00:04:33.050> eye<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.820> can

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
else that catches their eye so you can

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.540 
else that catches their eye so you can
expect<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.389> see<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:35.990> huge<00:04:36.740> spike<00:04:37.039> and<00:04:37.250> then<00:04:37.520> a

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
expect to see a huge spike and then a

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.260 
expect to see a huge spike and then a
huge<00:04:37.820> fall<00:04:38.500> probably<00:04:39.500> within<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:40.490> few<00:04:40.760> months<00:04:40.910> I

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
huge fall probably within a few months I

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.879 
huge fall probably within a few months I
would<00:04:41.600> say<00:04:41.840> but<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.650> think<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.820> end<00:04:43.850> um<00:04:44.889> we

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
would say but I think in the end um we

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.770 
would say but I think in the end um we
will<00:04:46.130> end<00:04:46.430> up<00:04:46.550> having<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:46.970> larger<00:04:47.389> role<00:04:47.539> play

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
will end up having a larger role play

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.020 
will end up having a larger role play
community<00:04:48.289> as<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.440> whole<00:04:48.590> more<00:04:49.520> role<00:04:49.760> players

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
community as a whole more role players

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.200 
community as a whole more role players
means<00:04:50.510> more<00:04:51.169> guilds<00:04:51.860> more<00:04:52.070> storylines<00:04:52.850> more

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
means more guilds more storylines more

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.360 
means more guilds more storylines more
opportunities<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.650> always<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.130> good<00:04:55.310> thing

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370

all<00:06:18.639> the<00:06:18.759> time<00:06:18.819> but<00:06:19.360> sometimes<00:06:19.810> it<00:06:20.199> does<00:06:20.349> so

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680

and any faction I feel like that would

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.749 
and any faction I feel like that would
be<00:06:43.449> a<00:06:43.690> good<00:06:43.930> purchase<00:06:44.169> to<00:06:44.440> have<00:06:44.530> I<00:06:45.190> heard

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
that every once in a while or something

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.960 
that every once in a while or something
so<00:06:49.750> we'll<00:06:49.990> see<00:06:50.229> a<00:06:50.740> character<00:06:51.400> named<00:06:51.610> change

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
time but this roleplay community is very

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.270 
time but this roleplay community is very
resilient<00:07:43.719> we've<00:07:44.259> dealt<00:07:44.560> with<00:07:44.710> the<00:07:44.830> phasing

issue we will deal with this and I don't
really<00:07:48.190> think<00:07:48.310> it's<00:07:48.639> even<00:07:48.759> going<00:07:49.000> to<00:07:49.030> be

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150

dealing with anything so much as just

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:54.209 
dealing with anything so much as just
