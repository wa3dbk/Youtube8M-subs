00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.780
 the panela production process 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.460
 It comprises different stages starting 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.500
 the selection and implementation of 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.470
 lots stipulated for the sowing of the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.820
 cane the cut the raw material and the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.740
 juice extraction until the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.170
 transformation of these into the product 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.430
 final panela either alone or 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.620
 powdered 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.600
 then the stage of 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.419
 extraction of juice from the cane or 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.700
 known as the grinding stage in 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.670
 this stage the raw material is processed 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.830
 to get your juices and a by-product 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.050
 called bagasse which is followed by 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.850
 process to become panela but 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.160
 which is used for the generation of 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.970
 necessary heat in different phases of the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 process 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.140
 the cane is passed through a machine the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.990
 which is responsible for subjecting the compression 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.270
 to get the juice from the stems is 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.670
 machine is called mill or train 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.679
 mills 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.899
 in the industry panel was found 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.360
 two types of mills those that have their 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.730
 vertical masses and those that have them 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.890
 horizontally 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.810
 The following image shows the exploded view 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.810
 isometric of a horizontal mill 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.180
 this is a scale model of a mill 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.550
 of three rollers or more flails 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.530
 the engine generates a power which is 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.950
 transmits by means of a strap to the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.050
 pulley or steering wheel later this 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.540
 pulley will transmit its power to the mass 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.790
 higher or higher as it goes through 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.410
 half of two pairs of gears the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.900
 which decrease the revolutions by 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.520
 minute of the steering wheel and increase the strength 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.770
 of the superior mass 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.009
 the pinion of the Mayan mass makes the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.750
 crushing mass and repasador to the cane is 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.219
 led to the Maya mass and the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.649
 breaker where the 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.600
 first extraction and for effect the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.100
 movement of the same masses the cane 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.319
 compressed the pair is driven 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.830
 formed by the mass and re Maya 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.050
 past, thus obtaining the bagasse 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.760
 the juice of the cane falls by gravity to the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.070
 base of the mill in which 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.990
 will transport by a channel and the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.990
 mill to the other phases of the process
