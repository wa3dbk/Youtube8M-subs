and<00:00:19.580> many<00:00:19.789> design<00:00:20.240> iterations<00:00:20.869> we<00:00:21.080> have<00:00:21.260> a

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
and many design iterations we have a

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.830 
and many design iterations we have a
super<00:00:21.920> fun<00:00:22.250> high-performance<00:00:23.240> machine<00:00:23.630> that

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
super fun high-performance machine that

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.779 
super fun high-performance machine that
anybody<00:00:24.109> can<00:00:24.260> get<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.439> great<00:00:24.800> low<00:00:25.400> impact

anybody can get a great low impact
running<00:00:26.090> workout<00:00:26.630> outdoors<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.560> we<00:00:27.679> ended<00:00:27.830> up

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
running workout outdoors so we ended up

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.380 
running workout outdoors so we ended up
with<00:00:28.009> a<00:00:28.039> machine<00:00:28.460> that's<00:00:28.699> just<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:29.240> much

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
with a machine that's just so much

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.029 
with a machine that's just so much
superior<00:00:29.840> to<00:00:30.170> what's<00:00:30.349> found<00:00:30.500> in<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:30.800> gym

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
superior to what's found in the gym

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.760 
superior to what's found in the gym
because<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:31.759> really<00:00:32.029> diagnosed<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.320> essence

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
because we really diagnosed the essence

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.920 
because we really diagnosed the essence
of<00:00:33.920> running<00:00:34.400> and<00:00:34.640> how<00:00:35.150> we<00:00:35.210> could<00:00:35.390> emulate<00:00:35.660> it

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
of running and how we could emulate it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.720 
of running and how we could emulate it
on<00:00:35.990> one<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.230> these<00:00:36.410> systems<00:00:36.860> we<00:00:37.280> need<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> much

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
on one of these systems we need a much

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.460 
on one of these systems we need a much
longer<00:00:38.420> stride<00:00:38.780> length<00:00:39.050> than<00:00:39.260> what<00:00:39.380> you

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
longer stride length than what you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.200 
longer stride length than what you
typically<00:00:39.740> find<00:00:39.829> at<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.219> gym<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.030> need<00:00:41.180> a

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
typically find at the gym and you need a

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.970 
typically find at the gym and you need a
much<00:00:41.450> different<00:00:41.840> recovery<00:00:42.140> stroke<00:00:42.649> than<00:00:42.860> what

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
much different recovery stroke than what

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.830 
much different recovery stroke than what
you<00:00:43.100> typically<00:00:43.399> find<00:00:43.520> it<00:00:43.789> in<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:44.360> we<00:00:44.570> made

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
you typically find it in so we made

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.170 
you typically find it in so we made
those<00:00:45.370> implementations<00:00:46.370> into<00:00:46.610> our<00:00:46.760> systems

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
those implementations into our systems

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.819 
those implementations into our systems
and<00:00:47.390> make<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:47.629> feel<00:00:47.960> much<00:00:48.199> more<00:00:48.440> like<00:00:48.649> running

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
and make it feel much more like running

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.459 
and make it feel much more like running
it's<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:49.370> easy<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.730> ride<00:00:49.940> it's<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.780> low<00:00:51.020> impact

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
it's so easy to ride it's so low impact

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.680 
it's so easy to ride it's so low impact
and<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:52.160> makes<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:52.489> feel<00:00:52.520> good<00:00:52.969> while<00:00:53.449> you're

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
and it makes you feel good while you're

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.270 
and it makes you feel good while you're
getting<00:00:53.840> your<00:00:54.079> exercise<00:00:54.350> I've<00:00:55.070> been<00:00:55.250> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
getting your exercise I've been a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.580 
getting your exercise I've been a
competitive<00:00:55.910> runners<00:00:56.390> cyclist<00:00:57.020> in<00:00:57.140> traffic

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
competitive runners cyclist in traffic

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.650 
competitive runners cyclist in traffic
over<00:00:57.739> twenty<00:00:58.100> five<00:00:58.250> years<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.000> I've<00:00:59.480> never

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
over twenty five years and I've never

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.119 
over twenty five years and I've never
been<00:00:59.780> on<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.050> machine<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.530> goes<00:01:00.649> better<00:01:00.859> on<00:01:01.010> my

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
been on a machine that goes better on my

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.920 
been on a machine that goes better on my
body<00:01:01.340> just<00:01:01.940> like<00:01:02.239> riding<00:01:02.600> for<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.809> better

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
body just like riding for the better

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.170 
body just like riding for the better
it's<00:01:03.289> just<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.980> smooth<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.730> feels<00:01:04.910> really

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
it's just so smooth it feels really

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.880 
it's just so smooth it feels really
natural<00:01:05.330> your<00:01:05.990> head<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.230> in<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.440> same<00:01:06.680> natural

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
natural your head is in the same natural

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.260 
natural your head is in the same natural
position<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:07.760> when<00:01:07.910> you're<00:01:08.030> running

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
position that it is when you're running

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.480 
position that it is when you're running
so<00:01:08.660> you<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:08.900> go<00:01:09.020> for<00:01:09.200> 10<00:01:09.440> or<00:01:09.470> 20<00:01:09.830> miles<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.370> see

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
so you can go for 10 or 20 miles and see

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.039 
so you can go for 10 or 20 miles and see
things<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.940> never<00:01:11.090> could<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.540> run<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
things that you never could on a run and

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.630 
things that you never could on a run and
things<00:01:12.350> you'd<00:01:12.470> probably<00:01:12.680> miss<00:01:13.130> on<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.400> bike

the elliptical machines in a gym but

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.600 
the elliptical machines in a gym but
just<00:01:20.990> allowed<00:01:21.229> me<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.409> get<00:01:21.650> outside<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:22.520> know

I got hip problems and I just need
non-impact<00:01:29.090> exercise<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:29.930> is<00:01:30.079> just<00:01:30.259> perfect

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
non-impact exercise this is just perfect

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.179 
non-impact exercise this is just perfect
for<00:01:30.890> that

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
for that

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.010 
for that
so<00:01:31.400> people<00:01:31.610> are<00:01:31.790> blown<00:01:31.970> away<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.689> how<00:01:32.840> much

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
so people are blown away and how much

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.539 
so people are blown away and how much
they<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.200> get<00:01:33.290> their<00:01:33.439> heart<00:01:33.619> rate<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:34.159> what

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
they can get their heart rate up what

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.280 
they can get their heart rate up what
kind<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.790> cardio<00:01:35.119> workout<00:01:35.450> they<00:01:35.600> can<00:01:35.869> get<00:01:36.110> on

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
kind of cardio workout they can get on

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.109
