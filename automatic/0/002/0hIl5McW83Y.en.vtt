foundation of getting your finances in

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.360 
foundation of getting your finances in
order<00:00:36.839> when<00:00:37.839> we<00:00:37.960> have<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.229> plan<00:00:38.679> for<00:00:38.920> our<00:00:39.069> money

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
order when we have a plan for our money

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.910 
order when we have a plan for our money
we<00:00:40.210> notice<00:00:40.600> our<00:00:40.809> money<00:00:41.050> actually<00:00:41.589> starts

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
we notice our money actually starts

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.250 
we notice our money actually starts
working<00:00:42.399> for<00:00:42.579> us<00:00:42.670> which<00:00:42.940> is<00:00:42.969> a<00:00:43.329> good<00:00:43.600> thing<00:00:43.659> but

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
working for us which is a good thing but

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.139 
working for us which is a good thing but
it<00:00:44.499> can't<00:00:44.739> be<00:00:44.889> hard<00:00:45.190> because<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:45.699> have<00:00:45.909> an

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
it can't be hard because we have an

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.200 
it can't be hard because we have an
irregular<00:00:46.600> income<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:48.039> the<00:00:48.370> first<00:00:48.760> step<00:00:48.909> in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
irregular income so the first step in

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.969 
irregular income so the first step in
handling<00:00:49.749> and<00:00:49.929> irregular<00:00:50.319> income<00:00:50.739> is

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
handling and irregular income is

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.709 
handling and irregular income is
actually<00:00:51.670> knowing<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.089> months<00:00:52.449> that<00:00:52.479> our

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
actually knowing the months that our

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.689 
actually knowing the months that our
money<00:00:52.870> is<00:00:53.199> coming<00:00:53.769> in<00:00:54.039> which<00:00:54.339> is<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.489> good<00:00:54.639> thing

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
money is coming in which is a good thing

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.229 
money is coming in which is a good thing
so<00:00:55.120> what<00:00:55.959> we<00:00:56.139> do<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.409> we<00:00:57.100> keep<00:00:57.549> track<00:00:57.850> on<00:00:58.149> a

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
so what we do is we keep track on a

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.239 
so what we do is we keep track on a
chart<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:59.170> money<00:00:59.350> that<00:00:59.559> we<00:00:59.649> have<00:00:59.829> coming<00:01:00.100> in
