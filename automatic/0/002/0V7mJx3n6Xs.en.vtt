as<00:00:52.309> me<00:00:52.489> that<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.850> game<00:00:53.059> was<00:00:53.270> just<00:00:53.330> a<00:00:53.540> little

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
as me that the game was just a little

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.549 
as me that the game was just a little
too<00:00:53.960> depressing

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
too depressing

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.460 
too depressing
and<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.190> made<00:00:55.370> no<00:00:55.550> sense<00:00:55.820> at<00:00:56.090> all<00:00:56.120> no<00:00:56.900> no<00:00:57.290> it

and it made no sense at all no no it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.470 
and it made no sense at all no no it
made<00:00:57.680> sense<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.310> game<00:00:58.490> is<00:00:58.670> all<00:00:58.850> about<00:00:58.880> Mickey

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
made sense the game is all about Mickey

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.140 
made sense the game is all about Mickey
screwing<00:00:59.930> up<00:01:00.080> his<00:01:00.230> magical<00:01:00.890> world<00:01:01.150> forgotten

I<00:01:04.640> thought<00:01:04.940> Mickey<00:01:05.210> was<00:01:05.509> epic<00:01:05.900> enough<00:01:06.440> about

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
kind of annoyed that the game really

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.639 
kind of annoyed that the game really
didn't<00:01:43.700> feel<00:01:43.880> like<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.240> Disney<00:01:44.660> type<00:01:44.929> game<00:01:45.319> and

all let's talk about the mission
objectives<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.300> really<00:02:08.660> did<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.110> kind<00:02:09.410> of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
objectives I really did like to kind of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.290 
objectives I really did like to kind of
open<00:02:09.709> mission<00:02:10.340> objectives<00:02:10.819> they<00:02:10.940> give<00:02:11.150> you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
open mission objectives they give you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.850 
open mission objectives they give you
there<00:02:11.630> were<00:02:11.720> often<00:02:11.900> multiple<00:02:12.260> mission

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
there were often multiple mission

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.589 
there were often multiple mission
objectives<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.610> could<00:02:13.760> do<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:14.480> do

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
objectives that you could do I really do

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.760 
objectives that you could do I really do
like<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.900> fact<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.290> these<00:02:15.410> mission

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
like the fact that these mission

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.620 
like the fact that these mission
objectives<00:02:16.280> often<00:02:16.580> had<00:02:16.760> two<00:02:17.030> ways<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.420> doing

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
objectives often had two ways of doing

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.360 
objectives often had two ways of doing
it<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.230> either<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.620> take<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> easy<00:02:19.069> route

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
it so either you can take the easy route

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.000 
it so either you can take the easy route
or<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.849> hard<00:02:20.060> route<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.140> good<00:02:21.440> route<00:02:21.740> in

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
or the hard route and the good route in

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.540 
or the hard route and the good route in
the<00:02:22.190> bad<00:02:22.430> route<00:02:22.819> same<00:02:23.300> thing<00:02:23.569> well<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.140> mean<00:02:24.550> you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
the bad route same thing well I mean you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.910 
the bad route same thing well I mean you
gotta<00:02:25.819> have<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.569> some

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
gotta have like some

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.610 
gotta have like some
you<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.940> depend<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.530> example

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
you have to depend on like for example

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.190 
you have to depend on like for example
in<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.220> beginning<00:02:31.390> there's<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> character<00:02:33.020> and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
in the beginning there's a character and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.110 
in the beginning there's a character and
a<00:02:33.260> treasure<00:02:33.560> chest<00:02:33.680> they<00:02:34.280> tell<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> which<00:02:34.910> one

a treasure chest they tell you which one
to<00:02:35.270> choose

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
to choose

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.630 
to choose
right<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> moral<00:02:36.709> choice<00:02:36.950> all<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
right it's a moral choice all the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.860 
right it's a moral choice all the
choices<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.060> make<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.420> game<00:02:38.450> actually

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
choices you make in the game actually

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.270 
choices you make in the game actually
matter<00:02:39.440> because<00:02:39.860> there<00:02:40.010> are<00:02:40.130> multiple

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
matter because there are multiple

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.949 
matter because there are multiple
endings<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.120> game<00:02:41.390> which<00:02:41.720> means

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
endings to this game which means

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.620 
endings to this game which means
replayability<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.950> very<00:02:43.160> high<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.760> chose<00:02:44.330> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
replayability is very high I chose the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.340 
replayability is very high I chose the
treasure<00:02:44.990> chest<00:02:45.709> you're<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.850> evil<00:02:47.060> sometimes

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.630 

now<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.410> whole<00:02:51.650> gimmick<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.070> this<00:02:52.220> game<00:02:52.430> was

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
now the whole gimmick of this game was

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.160 
now the whole gimmick of this game was
that<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.880> could<00:02:53.030> shoot<00:02:53.240> paint<00:02:53.570> out<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:54.110> a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
that you could shoot paint out of a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.860 
that you could shoot paint out of a
magic<00:02:54.560> paintbrush<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.520> redraw<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.090> world<00:02:56.510> in

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
magic paintbrush to redraw the world in

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.020 
magic paintbrush to redraw the world in
some<00:02:57.170> places<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.590> worlds<00:02:57.980> became<00:02:58.370> unpainted

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
some places the worlds became unpainted

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.940 
some places the worlds became unpainted
and<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.660> had<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.959> repaint<00:03:00.350> them<00:03:00.560> what'd<00:03:00.860> you

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and you had to repaint them what'd you

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.680 
and you had to repaint them what'd you
think<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.220> gimmick<00:03:01.700> one<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.360> sounds

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
think of that gimmick one that sounds

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.100 
think of that gimmick one that sounds
manly<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.380> two<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.489> can<00:03:04.850> repaint<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.930> an

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
manly and two you can repaint it an

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.830 
manly and two you can repaint it an
unpainted<00:03:06.880> depending<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.239> puzzle<00:03:08.690> that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
unpainted depending on the puzzle that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.490 
unpainted depending on the puzzle that
you<00:03:09.110> have<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.220> was<00:03:10.489> creative<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.690> guess<00:03:11.810> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
you have to do it was creative I guess I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.530 
you have to do it was creative I guess I
do<00:03:12.890> agree<00:03:13.250> with<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.610> but<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.090> think<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:14.420> is

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
do agree with you but I think this is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
do agree with you but I think this is
another<00:03:14.720> instance<00:03:14.959> where<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.680> would<00:03:15.860> have

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
another instance where it would have

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.290 
another instance where it would have
been<00:03:16.070> better<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.430> play<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.760> whole<00:03:16.910> game<00:03:17.120> in

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
been better to play the whole game in

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.870 
been better to play the whole game in
like<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.480> colorful<00:03:18.110> world<00:03:18.320> what<00:03:18.950> do<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.280> mean<00:03:19.550> I

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
like a colorful world what do you mean I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.490 
like a colorful world what do you mean I
think<00:03:20.180> if<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.600> game<00:03:20.780> didn't<00:03:21.140> look<00:03:21.260> so

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
think if the game didn't look so

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.199 
think if the game didn't look so
depressing<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.100> paint<00:03:22.550> gimmick<00:03:22.910> would<00:03:23.090> have

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
depressing that paint gimmick would have

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.790 
depressing that paint gimmick would have
been<00:03:23.300> more<00:03:23.510> fun<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.200> enemies<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> game

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
been more fun the enemies in the game

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.710 
been more fun the enemies in the game
were<00:03:25.190> fun<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.580> play<00:03:25.790> against<00:03:26.300> like<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
were fun to play against like the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.210 
were fun to play against like the
missions<00:03:27.019> itself<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.709> lot<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.070> enemies

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
missions itself a lot of the enemies

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.009 
missions itself a lot of the enemies
could<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.730> defeated<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.300> two<00:03:29.510> different<00:03:29.870> ways

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
could be defeated in two different ways

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.319 
could be defeated in two different ways
either<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.739> can<00:03:31.010> use<00:03:31.040> paint<00:03:31.489> thinner<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.150> rub

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
either you can use paint thinner to rub

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.509 
either you can use paint thinner to rub
them<00:03:32.510> out<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.810> existence<00:03:33.320> or<00:03:33.799> splash<00:03:34.280> them

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
them out of existence or splash them

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.009 
them out of existence or splash them
with<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> bunch<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.060> paint<00:03:35.329> and<00:03:35.540> they'll<00:03:35.870> be

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
with a bunch of paint and they'll be

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.690 
with a bunch of paint and they'll be
your<00:03:36.170> friend<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.829> help<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.160> out<00:03:37.280> against<00:03:37.549> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
your friend and help you out against the

your friend and help you out against the
other<00:03:37.850> enemies<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.570> did<00:03:38.900> like<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.260> aspect<00:03:39.590> of

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
other enemies I did like that aspect of

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.530 
other enemies I did like that aspect of
the<00:03:39.890> game<00:03:40.100> since<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.610> kind<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:40.910> changed<00:03:41.269> up<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
the game since it kind of changed up the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.449 
the game since it kind of changed up the
way<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.750> battle<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.230> bad<00:03:42.500> guys<00:03:42.799> since<00:03:43.310> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
way you battle the bad guys since the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.069 
way you battle the bad guys since the
enemies<00:03:43.790> were<00:03:43.910> never<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.239> hard<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.570> beat<00:03:44.810> it

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
enemies were never that hard to beat it

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.930 
enemies were never that hard to beat it
kept<00:03:45.350> them<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.650> not<00:03:45.860> nee<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> fighting<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.910> a

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
kept them a not nee of the fighting to a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.420 
kept them a not nee of the fighting to a
lesser<00:03:47.299> extent<00:03:47.329> however<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.680> worst<00:03:48.890> enemy<00:03:49.370> in

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
lesser extent however the worst enemy in

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.690 
lesser extent however the worst enemy in
the<00:03:49.519> game<00:03:49.549> is<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.420> camera<00:03:51.019> it's<00:03:51.320> truly<00:03:52.100> awful

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
the game is the camera it's truly awful

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.009 
the game is the camera it's truly awful
there<00:03:53.060> were<00:03:53.150> plenty<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.510> times<00:03:53.720> where<00:03:53.930> you

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
there were plenty of times where you

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.720 
there were plenty of times where you
would<00:03:54.140> just<00:03:54.260> die<00:03:54.500> because<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:55.040> bad<00:03:55.250> camera

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
would just die because of bad camera

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.910 
would just die because of bad camera
angles<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.390> can't<00:03:56.690> control<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.200> camera<00:03:57.680> but

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
angles you can't control the camera but

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.259 
angles you can't control the camera but
it<00:03:58.010> shouldn't<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.400> been<00:03:58.459> as<00:03:58.640> hard<00:03:58.880> as<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.120> was

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
it shouldn't have been as hard as it was

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.270 
it shouldn't have been as hard as it was
to<00:03:59.480> get<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.660> good<00:03:59.900> camera<00:04:00.380> angle<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.739> play<00:04:00.950> I

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
to get a good camera angle to play I

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.640 
to get a good camera angle to play I

just<00:04:21.229> say<00:04:21.380> rent<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.950> one<00:04:22.190> I'm<00:04:22.280> really<00:04:22.460> torn

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
just say rent this one I'm really torn

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.700 
just say rent this one I'm really torn
on<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.330> don't<00:04:23.450> really<00:04:23.780> think<00:04:23.870> it's<00:04:24.169> worth<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.500> buy

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
on I don't really think it's worth a buy

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.740 
on I don't really think it's worth a buy
but<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.220> think<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:25.580> better<00:04:25.760> than<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> rent<00:04:26.360> so

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
but I think it's better than a rent so

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.240 
but I think it's better than a rent so
this<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.020> one<00:04:27.169> of<00:04:27.260> those<00:04:27.320> times<00:04:27.620> where<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:27.890> can't

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
this is one of those times where I can't

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.340 
this is one of those times where I can't
pigeonhole<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.000> into<00:04:29.450> a<00:04:29.479> buy<00:04:29.750> or<00:04:30.050> rent

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
pigeonhole it into a buy or rent

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.010 
pigeonhole it into a buy or rent
category<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.400> should<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:31.850> call<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.360> print

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
category so should I call this a print

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.430 
category so should I call this a print
or<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.380> Rai<00:04:33.860> no<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.640> can't<00:04:35.120> do<00:04:35.300> that<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.780> gotta<00:04:36.169> pick

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.770 
or a Rai no I can't do that I gotta pick
one<00:04:36.650> fire<00:04:37.010> rent<00:04:37.460> I'd<00:04:37.880> say<00:04:38.120> there<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.450> just

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.740 
enough content to worthy a buy but I
wait<00:04:41.430> until<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.760> comes<00:04:41.970> down<00:04:42.120> in<00:04:42.330> price<00:04:42.540> till

wait until it comes down in price till

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.110 
wait until it comes down in price till
about<00:04:42.930> 20<00:04:43.320> or<00:04:43.500> $30
