for<00:00:10.460> natural<00:00:10.880> science<00:00:11.210> video<00:00:11.420> we<00:00:11.630> will<00:00:11.720> be

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
for natural science video we will be

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.360 
for natural science video we will be
showing<00:00:12.080> you<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:12.350> chemical<00:00:12.920> reaction

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
showing you the chemical reaction

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.750 
showing you the chemical reaction
between<00:00:13.490> water<00:00:14.000> and<00:00:14.270> dish<00:00:14.660> soap<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:15.170> pepper

between water and dish soap and pepper

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.519 
between water and dish soap and pepper
here<00:00:16.760> we<00:00:16.910> have<00:00:17.119> two<00:00:17.390> bowls<00:00:17.660> of<00:00:17.900> water<00:00:18.140> with

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
here we have two bowls of water with

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.269 
here we have two bowls of water with
nothing<00:00:18.800> else<00:00:19.189> in<00:00:19.520> them<00:00:20.650> next<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:21.980> grind

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
nothing else in them next we grind

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.730 
nothing else in them next we grind
peppercorns<00:00:23.119> which<00:00:23.990> will<00:00:24.230> lie<00:00:24.380> on<00:00:24.410> the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
peppercorns which will lie on the

peppercorns which will lie on the
surface<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.400> water<00:00:25.640> since<00:00:26.029> we'll<00:00:26.210> place

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
surface of the water since we'll place

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.870

one<00:00:45.589> of<00:00:45.710> us<00:00:45.830> will<00:00:46.040> put<00:00:46.250> dishwasher<00:00:47.150> soap<00:00:47.420> on

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
one of us will put dishwasher soap on

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.100 
one of us will put dishwasher soap on
our<00:00:47.960> index<00:00:48.260> finger<00:00:49.089> while<00:00:50.089> another<00:00:50.390> will<00:00:50.839> not

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.020 

next<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:54.440> touch<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.920> surface<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.549> the<00:00:55.790> water

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
next you touch the surface of the water

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.180 
next you touch the surface of the water
in<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.479> middle<00:00:56.659> of<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.019> bowls<00:00:57.260> using<00:00:58.040> our

in the middle of the bowls using our

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.180 
in the middle of the bowls using our
index<00:00:58.640> fingers<00:00:59.059> one<00:00:59.870> having<00:01:00.229> soap<00:01:00.500> on<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.739> the

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
other not Kabam as you can see in the

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.679 
other not Kabam as you can see in the
bowl<00:01:12.799> with<00:01:13.010> soap<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.700> pepper<00:01:13.939> has<00:01:14.210> moved<00:01:14.539> to

bowl with soap the pepper has moved to

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.080 
bowl with soap the pepper has moved to
the<00:01:14.810> edges<00:01:15.109> of<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.320> bowl<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.369> does<00:01:16.609> not<00:01:16.789> with

the edges of the bowl and does not with

the edges of the bowl and does not with
the<00:01:17.210> other<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:19.250> because<00:01:19.549> soap<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:20.119> made

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
the other this is because soap is made

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.380 
the other this is because soap is made
of<00:01:20.869> super<00:01:21.409> fat<00:01:21.829> scents<00:01:22.219> which<00:01:22.430> are<00:01:22.609> compounds

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
of super fat scents which are compounds
