it mustn't have any gas in it then it

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.050 
it mustn't have any gas in it then it
was<00:01:15.380> was<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.860> really<00:01:16.100> leaking<00:01:16.460> he<00:01:16.580> told<00:01:16.820> me<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
gas gauge didn't work but he put ten

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.460 
gas gauge didn't work but he put ten
gallons<00:01:18.950> in<00:01:19.100> here<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.490> could<00:01:19.970> smell<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.270> gas<00:01:21.229> as

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
gallons in here I could smell the gas as

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.190 
gallons in here I could smell the gas as
a<00:01:21.500> trip<00:01:21.770> went<00:01:21.979> on<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.310> 110<00:01:22.970> oxygen<00:01:23.690> didn't

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
a trip went on but a 110 oxygen didn't

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.280 
a trip went on but a 110 oxygen didn't
uh<00:01:24.280> didn't<00:01:25.280> drip<00:01:25.460> down<00:01:25.670> no<00:01:25.850> no<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.450> pans<00:01:26.990> catch

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
uh didn't drip down no no the pans catch

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.430 
uh didn't drip down no no the pans catch
everything<00:01:27.560> oh<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.850> know<00:01:29.090> why<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.170> fuel

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
everything oh you know why it's a fuel

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.670 
everything oh you know why it's a fuel
cell<00:01:30.710> oh<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:32.479> all<00:01:32.600> absorbed<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.380> in

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
cell oh so it's all absorbed in this in

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.029 
cell oh so it's all absorbed in this in
the<00:01:33.830> cell<00:01:34.100> itself<00:01:34.490> oh<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.450> okay<00:01:35.720> yeah

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
the cell itself oh is that it okay yeah

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.219 
the cell itself oh is that it okay yeah
so<00:01:37.039> if<00:01:37.550> I<00:01:37.700> could<00:01:37.910> patch<00:01:38.179> that<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.570> think<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:38.990> I

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
so if I could patch that I think it's I

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.380 
so if I could patch that I think it's I
think<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:39.590> good<00:01:39.800> okay<00:01:42.910> I'll<00:01:43.910> get<00:01:44.030> some<00:01:44.179> rags

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
think it's good okay I'll get some rags

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.150 
think it's good okay I'll get some rags
all<00:01:44.780> right<00:01:44.899> thanks<00:01:45.289> you<00:01:45.530> need<00:01:45.679> brake<00:01:45.920> clean

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
all right thanks you need brake clean

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.060 
all right thanks you need brake clean
that<00:01:46.850> would<00:01:46.940> be<00:01:47.000> good<00:01:47.179> okay<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.470> driver<00:01:48.770> said

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
that would be good okay the driver said

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.529 
that would be good okay the driver said
he<00:01:49.160> smelled<00:01:49.399> some<00:01:49.640> gas<00:01:49.820> we<00:01:50.090> looked<00:01:50.270> underneath

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
he smelled some gas we looked underneath

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.630 
he smelled some gas we looked underneath
and<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.840> was<00:01:50.960> dripping<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.130> jacked<00:01:52.490> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
and it was dripping so I jacked the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.190 
and it was dripping so I jacked the
Cobra<00:01:52.970> up<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.330> found<00:01:53.539> out<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.840> there's

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
Cobra up and found out that there's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.990 
Cobra up and found out that there's
actually<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.649> small<00:01:55.190> little<00:01:55.520> hole<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.909> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
actually a small little hole in the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.940 
actually a small little hole in the
bottom<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.479> gas<00:01:56.630> tank<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.710> one<00:01:57.860> of

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
bottom of the gas tank it's in one of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
bottom of the gas tank it's in one of
the<00:01:58.009> very<00:01:58.220> corners<00:01:58.759> where<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.060> probably<00:01:59.210> was

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
the very corners where it probably was

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.270 
the very corners where it probably was
laying<00:01:59.899> on<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.080> floor<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.740> just<00:02:00.920> wore<00:02:01.130> out

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
laying on the floor and it just wore out

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.550 
laying on the floor and it just wore out
after<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> while<00:02:01.850> maybe<00:02:02.509> scraping<00:02:03.140> over<00:02:03.259> some

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
after a while maybe scraping over some

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.620 
after a while maybe scraping over some
some<00:02:04.310> curbs<00:02:04.880> or<00:02:05.119> something<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.569> that

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
some curbs or something like that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.359 
some curbs or something like that
whatever<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.590> hopefully<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> one<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
whatever so hopefully a one of the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.910 
whatever so hopefully a one of the
drivers<00:02:10.759> say<00:02:10.880> they<00:02:11.030> have<00:02:11.180> some<00:02:11.420> jb<00:02:11.810> weld<00:02:12.019> so

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
drivers say they have some jb weld so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.170 
drivers say they have some jb weld so
we're<00:02:13.010> gonna<00:02:13.100> put<00:02:13.340> some<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.549> that<00:02:13.640> stuff<00:02:13.760> down

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
we're gonna put some of that stuff down

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.729 
we're gonna put some of that stuff down
there<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.630> hopefully<00:02:15.200> that'll<00:02:15.410> stop<00:02:15.709> the

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
there and hopefully that'll stop the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.220 
there and hopefully that'll stop the
leak<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.640> fuel<00:02:16.910> cell<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:18.049> pretty

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
leak it's a fuel cell so it's pretty

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.080 
leak it's a fuel cell so it's pretty
safe

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
safe

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.380 
safe
