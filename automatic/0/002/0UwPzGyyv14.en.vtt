have to be a 7th chord but it's a little

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
have to be a 7th chord but it's a little
easier<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> notes<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.500> spread<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.860> like

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
was teaching at that time I I had a

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.050 
was teaching at that time I I had a
piano<00:02:33.560> studio<00:02:33.950> called<00:02:34.250> piano<00:02:34.430> universities

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
piano studio called piano universities

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.620 
piano studio called piano universities
so<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.450> named<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.470> straddle<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.670> taught<00:02:38.510> it

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
so I named it the straddle and taught it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.390 
so I named it the straddle and taught it
to<00:02:38.660> my<00:02:38.840> students<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.500> then<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:40.160> kind<00:02:40.280> of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
to my students and then that kind of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.550 
to my students and then that kind of
spread<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:41.030> lot<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.660> other<00:02:41.750> piano<00:02:42.140> teachers

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
spread a lot of other piano teachers

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.860 
spread a lot of other piano teachers
picked<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.160> up<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.490> so<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:44.120> generally<00:02:44.450> known

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
picked it up and so it's generally known

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.050 
picked it up and so it's generally known
now<00:02:45.110> as<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.560> straddle<00:02:46.010> but<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.700> came<00:02:46.850> from

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
now as the straddle but it came from

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.030 
now as the straddle but it came from
that<00:02:47.120> two<00:02:47.450> by<00:02:47.660> two<00:02:47.720> technique<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.800> patty

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
that two by two technique that patty

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.750 
that two by two technique that patty
played<00:02:49.400> way<00:02:50.060> back<00:02:50.270> years<00:02:50.990> ago<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.520> it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
played way back years ago and so it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.730 
played way back years ago and so it
rightfully<00:02:53.540> should<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.140> called<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.500> patty

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
rightfully should be called a patty

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.420 
rightfully should be called a patty

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.949 
McCoy to buy to straddle but in any case
that's<00:02:58.880> how<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.239> done<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.600> that's<00:02:59.690> how<00:02:59.900> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
that's how it's done and that's how the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.970 
that's how it's done and that's how the
name<00:03:00.320> where<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.310> name<00:03:01.520> came<00:03:01.760> from<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.980> it's

name where the name came from and it's
it's<00:03:04.310> very<00:03:04.550> useful<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.060> breaking<00:03:05.420> up<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.690> chord

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
it's very useful in breaking up a chord

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.720 
it's very useful in breaking up a chord
and<00:03:06.260> getting<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:06.920> kind<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.280> sound<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.640> course

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and getting that kind of sound of course

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.260 
and getting that kind of sound of course
it<00:03:07.880> be<00:03:08.000> done<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.330> any<00:03:08.450> rhythm

there but it's the same idea so let's do

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.490 
there but it's the same idea so let's do
it<00:03:19.700> slow<00:03:20.000> together<00:03:20.270> let's<00:03:20.480> take<00:03:20.540> say<00:03:21.110> D<00:03:21.290> minor

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
it slow together let's take say D minor
