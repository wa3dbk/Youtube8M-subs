example has finally arrived and not at
all<00:00:29.710> in<00:00:29.829> the<00:00:29.890> manner<00:00:30.040> I<00:00:30.099> expected<00:00:30.579> but<00:00:31.029> before

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
all in the manner I expected but before

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.639 
all in the manner I expected but before
we<00:00:31.329> start<00:00:31.540> let<00:00:31.720> me<00:00:31.750> contextualize<00:00:32.200> the

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
we start let me contextualize the

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.200 
we start let me contextualize the
discussion<00:00:33.070> we<00:00:33.399> were<00:00:33.520> originally<00:00:34.030> going<00:00:34.149> to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
discussion we were originally going to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.670 
discussion we were originally going to
approach<00:00:34.450> this<00:00:34.660> topic<00:00:34.840> much<00:00:35.200> like<00:00:35.380> we<00:00:35.470> did<00:00:35.590> the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
approach this topic much like we did the

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.470 
approach this topic much like we did the
first<00:00:35.890> two<00:00:36.040> diversity<00:00:36.489> episodes<00:00:36.880> finding<00:00:37.420> a

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
first two diversity episodes finding a

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.910 
first two diversity episodes finding a
good<00:00:37.600> example<00:00:37.899> character<00:00:38.380> from<00:00:38.530> some<00:00:38.739> game

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
good example character from some game

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.440 
good example character from some game
talking<00:00:39.340> about<00:00:39.640> why<00:00:39.730> that<00:00:39.880> character<00:00:40.210> works

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
talking about why that character works

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.790 
talking about why that character works
what<00:00:40.750> makes<00:00:40.930> them<00:00:41.079> meaningful<00:00:41.500> why<00:00:41.739> this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
what makes them meaningful why this

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.319 
what makes them meaningful why this
medium<00:00:42.190> would<00:00:42.309> benefit<00:00:42.609> from<00:00:42.670> more<00:00:42.969> like<00:00:43.149> them

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
medium would benefit from more like them

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.150 
medium would benefit from more like them
and<00:00:43.539> so<00:00:43.660> on<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:43.960> we<00:00:44.379> could<00:00:44.530> still<00:00:44.679> do<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:44.949> but

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
and so on and we could still do that but

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.459 
and so on and we could still do that but
then<00:00:45.550> we<00:00:45.730> realized<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.420> rather<00:00:46.780> obvious<00:00:47.199> fact

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
then we realized the rather obvious fact

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.979 
then we realized the rather obvious fact
that<00:00:47.559> we<00:00:48.010> already<00:00:48.160> did<00:00:48.399> that<00:00:48.550> twice<00:00:49.210> our

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
that we already did that twice our

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.389 
that we already did that twice our
argument<00:00:50.410> still<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.679> same<00:00:50.859> he<00:00:51.160> could<00:00:51.280> take

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
argument still the same he could take

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.979 
argument still the same he could take
our<00:00:51.519> sexual<00:00:51.820> diversity<00:00:52.059> topic<00:00:52.600> swap

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
our sexual diversity topic swap

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.290 
our sexual diversity topic swap
sexuality<00:00:53.769> for<00:00:53.980> race<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.789> overall<00:00:54.999> point

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
sexuality for race and the overall point

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.910 
sexuality for race and the overall point
would<00:00:55.449> remain<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.780> same<00:00:55.960> there's<00:00:56.530> no<00:00:56.679> sense

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
would remain the same there's no sense

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.619 
would remain the same there's no sense
in<00:00:57.010> turning<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.429> series<00:00:57.699> into<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> mad<00:00:58.179> lib<00:00:58.390> so

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
in turning this series into a mad lib so

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.000 
in turning this series into a mad lib so
I<00:00:58.809> think<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.170> might<00:00:59.260> be<00:00:59.289> more<00:00:59.559> worth<00:00:59.710> our<00:00:59.890> time

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
I think it might be more worth our time

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.739 
I think it might be more worth our time
to<00:01:00.309> broaden<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.760> discussion<00:01:01.179> from<00:01:01.359> racial

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
to broaden the discussion from racial

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.509 
to broaden the discussion from racial
diversity<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.469> race<00:01:02.679> and<00:01:02.920> games<00:01:03.159> in<00:01:03.399> general

today<00:01:04.239> we'll<00:01:04.449> be<00:01:04.540> talking<00:01:04.690> about<00:01:04.930> LA<00:01:05.350> noire

today we'll be talking about LA noire
now<00:01:06.159> I'll<00:01:06.370> readily<00:01:06.730> admit<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.150> la<00:01:07.300> noir

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
now I'll readily admit that la noir

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.180 
now I'll readily admit that la noir
isn't<00:01:07.960> perfect<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.650> running<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.070> shooting
