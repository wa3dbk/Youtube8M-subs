up<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.430> switchboard<00:00:07.069> 3com<00:00:10.309> slits<00:00:11.309> boards

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
up in a switchboard 3com slits boards

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.010 
up in a switchboard 3com slits boards
went<00:00:12.059> well<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:13.730> have<00:00:14.730> very<00:00:15.090> very<00:00:15.719> nice

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
went well for you have very very nice

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.110 
went well for you have very very nice
metals<00:00:16.590> inside<00:00:16.980> these<00:00:17.280> boards<00:00:20.120> switchboards

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
metals inside these boards switchboards

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.690 
metals inside these boards switchboards
you<00:00:21.420> know<00:00:21.630> they<00:00:21.870> use<00:00:22.140> them<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.700> industrial

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
you know they use them in industrial

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:35.940 
you know they use them in industrial
spots<00:00:24.360> so

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:46.310 

get<00:00:36.950> nice<00:00:37.190> high<00:00:37.490> grade<00:00:37.820> boards<00:00:38.330> in<00:00:38.540> them

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.630 

transformers<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.650> capacitors<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.460> see

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
transformers and capacitors and you see

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.130 
transformers and capacitors and you see
these<00:00:51.790> yellow<00:00:52.950> capacitors<00:00:53.950> on<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.280> board

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
these yellow capacitors on the board

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.100 
these yellow capacitors on the board
that's<00:00:56.700> tantalum<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.420> get<00:01:01.660> enough<00:01:01.989> of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
that's tantalum then you get enough of

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.260 
that's tantalum then you get enough of
those<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.620> can<00:01:02.800> get<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:06.610> guessing<00:01:07.180> about

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
those you can get and I'm guessing about

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.700 
those you can get and I'm guessing about
close<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.200> 300<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.830> pound<00:01:09.040> for<00:01:09.640> those<00:01:09.820> today<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
close to 300 a pound for those today so

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.260 
close to 300 a pound for those today so
what<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:11.950> do<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.250> I'm<00:01:12.820> going<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.030> take<00:01:13.119> a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
what I do is I'm going to take a

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
what I do is I'm going to take a
screwdriver<00:01:14.700> push<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.880> on<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.090> side<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.360> it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
screwdriver push it on the side of it

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.130 
screwdriver push it on the side of it
just<00:01:17.830> flip<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:20.340> collect<00:01:21.340> all<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.700> those<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
of 10 bits look what I pretty much do up

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:07.190 
of 10 bits look what I pretty much do up
 those<00:01:53.830> off

time so if you ever come across these

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:41.020 
time so if you ever come across these
boards<00:02:32.840> i<00:02:34.840> would<00:02:35.840> say<00:02:36.110> scrap<00:02:36.620> up<00:02:40.030> and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
boards i would say scrap up and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.650 
boards i would say scrap up and
scrapping<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:42.200> some<00:02:42.380> money<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:47.350> towards<00:02:48.350> a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
scrapping get some money for towards a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.970 
scrapping get some money for towards a
pretty<00:02:50.660> decent<00:02:51.080> step<00:02:51.590> on<00:02:51.860> them<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:56.980> rest

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
pretty decent step on them so just rest

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.490 
pretty decent step on them so just rest
of<00:02:58.280> them<00:02:58.400> off<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:58.970> i<00:02:59.210> get<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.660> board<00:03:00.080> at<00:03:00.350> it
