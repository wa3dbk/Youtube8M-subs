to keep it from touching any of the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.759 
to keep it from touching any of the
capacitors<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.700> short<00:03:39.700> out<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.850> console<00:03:40.390> and

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
capacitors to short out the console and

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.590 
capacitors to short out the console and
as<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.950> already<00:03:42.400> saw<00:03:42.670> under<00:03:43.060> there<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.269> had

as you already saw under there I had
tape<00:03:44.370> protecting<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> original<00:03:45.880> points<00:03:46.410> so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
tape protecting the original points so

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.530 
tape protecting the original points so
that's<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.920> um<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.940> can<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.269> hundred

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
that's it um you can have a hundred

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.460 
that's it um you can have a hundred
twenty<00:03:50.019> millimeter<00:03:50.560> fan

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
twenty millimeter fan

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.580 
twenty millimeter fan
or<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:53.540> notice<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.900> biggest<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.290> probably

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
or you notice the biggest you probably

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.190 
or you notice the biggest you probably
want<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.330> also<00:03:56.450> get<00:03:56.630> like<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.810> fifty

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
want you can also get like a fifty

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.440 
want you can also get like a fifty
millimeter<00:03:57.620> or<00:03:57.830> even<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.160> smaller<00:03:58.520> one<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.300> you

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
millimeter or even a smaller one and you

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.960 
millimeter or even a smaller one and you
can<00:03:59.600> actually<00:03:59.720> fit<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:00.290> in<00:04:00.500> there<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.880> you

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
can actually fit it in there so you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.330 
can actually fit it in there so you
don't<00:04:02.120> have<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.330> cut<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.570> hole<00:04:02.660> in<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.050> case<00:04:03.340> but

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
don't have to cut a hole in the case but

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.120 
don't have to cut a hole in the case but
either<00:04:04.490> way<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:04.910> using<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.240> 12-volt<00:04:05.690> fan

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
either way it's using a 12-volt fan

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.100 
either way it's using a 12-volt fan
source<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.520> that's<00:04:08.210> what<00:04:08.360> you<00:04:08.450> can<00:04:08.630> use<00:04:08.870> you

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
source and that's what you can use you

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.310 
source and that's what you can use you
can<00:04:09.230> also<00:04:09.320> use<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.740> DVD<00:04:10.130> tray<00:04:10.490> but<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:12.080> sucks
