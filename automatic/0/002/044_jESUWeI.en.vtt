quality of it I it surprised me that it
is<00:01:04.439> quite<00:01:04.619> good<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.960> when<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.049> feeling<00:01:07.409> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is quite good but when I'm feeling it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
is quite good but when I'm feeling it
I'm<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.860> sure<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.340> it'll<00:01:08.490> wear<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.180> not

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I'm not sure if it'll wear out or not

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
I'm not sure if it'll wear out or not
since<00:01:10.350> um<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.340> definitely<00:01:11.729> feel<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
since um you can definitely feel that it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
since um you can definitely feel that it
printed<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.840> since<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> printed<00:01:13.920> on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
printed on there since it is printed on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.260 
printed on there since it is printed on
American<00:01:14.520> Apparel<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:17.250> could<00:01:17.729> wear<00:01:18.150> out

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
American Apparel so it could wear out

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.850 
American Apparel so it could wear out
eventually<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.590> worried

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
eventually and that's what I'm worried

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
eventually and that's what I'm worried
about<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.310> haven't<00:01:20.490> worn<00:01:20.670> them<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> can't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
about but I haven't worn them so I can't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.429 
about but I haven't worn them so I can't
confirm<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> does<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:24.439> hoping

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
confirm if it does or not but I'm hoping

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.910 
confirm if it does or not but I'm hoping
that<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> doesn't<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:27.229> but<00:01:28.229> overall<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.619> think

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that it doesn't so but overall I think

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.380 
that it doesn't so but overall I think
there<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.100> pretty<00:01:29.670> good<00:01:29.820> quality<00:01:30.030> shirts
