00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I do this with kindergarten up through

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
I do this with kindergarten up through
second<00:01:02.430> grade<00:01:02.960> my<00:01:03.960> second<00:01:04.229> graders<00:01:04.500> are

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
second grade my second graders are

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.750 
second grade my second graders are
pretty<00:01:04.769> familiar<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.430> we'll<00:01:05.580> only

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
pretty familiar with it so we'll only

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.010 
pretty familiar with it so we'll only
say<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> once<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.510> twice

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
say it once or twice

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
say it once or twice
I<00:01:07.049> thought<00:01:07.560> tell<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> take<00:01:08.369> their<00:01:08.549> hand

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
I thought tell them to take their hand

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
I thought tell them to take their hand
like<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.270> kind<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.780> make<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> snake<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
we kind of move it around and our think

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.179 
we kind of move it around and our think
it's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:12.930> kiss<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.439> cheek<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189

likes<00:01:16.350> snake<00:01:16.770> kisses<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:18.090> our<00:01:18.390> other<00:01:18.570> hand

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
likes snake kisses then our other hand
