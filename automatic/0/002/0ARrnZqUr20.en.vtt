plus a steal at $249.99 but it seems

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.399 
plus a steal at $249.99 but it seems
fairly<00:01:50.549> priced<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.630> big<00:01:51.899> question<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
fairly priced the big question is

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.630 
fairly priced the big question is
whether<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.860> worth<00:01:53.040> spending<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.490> extra

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the speakers via a USB I think I'd

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
the speakers via a USB I think I'd
probably<00:02:10.470> spend<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> extra<00:02:11.250> $50<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
probably spend the extra $50 on the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
probably spend the extra $50 on the
newer<00:02:12.209> model<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> tend<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.200> go

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
newer model but I tend to go

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.900 
newer model but I tend to go
