hi<00:00:13.799> my<00:00:13.950> name's<00:00:14.129> Jason<00:00:14.400> Robards<00:00:14.760> I'm<00:00:15.180> from<00:00:15.480> text

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
hi my name's Jason Robards I'm from text

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.300 
hi my name's Jason Robards I'm from text
when<00:00:15.990> t1<00:00:16.110> and<00:00:17.029> this<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.390> d3<00:00:18.990> oh<00:00:19.259> and<00:00:19.650> you're

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
when t1 and this is d3 oh and you're

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.580 
when t1 and this is d3 oh and you're
probably<00:00:20.550> asking<00:00:20.759> what<00:00:21.450> what<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.169> Wallace

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
probably asking what what this Wallace

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.409 
probably asking what what this Wallace
is<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:22.950> about<00:00:23.250> well<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
is all about well this is a

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.380 
is all about well this is a
non-newtonian<00:00:25.320> fabric<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:27.119> how<00:00:27.360> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
non-newtonian fabric and how a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.780 
non-newtonian fabric and how a
non-newtonian<00:00:27.989> fabric<00:00:28.529> works<00:00:28.739> is<00:00:29.509> very<00:00:30.509> soft

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
non-newtonian fabric works is very soft

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.110 
non-newtonian fabric works is very soft
very<00:00:32.790> soft<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.960> upon<00:00:34.260> impact<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
very soft but upon impact so if I was to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
very soft but upon impact so if I was to
punch<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:38.219> goes<00:00:38.460> rock-hard<00:00:38.940> now<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.399> good

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
punch it it goes rock-hard now a good

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
punch it it goes rock-hard now a good
way<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.670> demonstrating<00:00:42.269> that<00:00:42.539> is<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.109> I<00:00:43.230> take

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
way of demonstrating that is if I take

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.860 
way of demonstrating that is if I take
this<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:45.230> I<00:00:46.519> put<00:00:47.519> my<00:00:47.640> finger<00:00:48.059> around<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this and I put my finger around here and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319 
this and I put my finger around here and
I'd<00:00:49.079> say<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> axe<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:50.609> if<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.089> like<00:00:51.269> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
I'd say the axe now if I go like this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
I'd say the axe now if I go like this
I'm<00:00:51.989> gonna<00:00:52.079> chop<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.499> pinger<00:00:52.769> off<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.160> not

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I'm gonna chop the pinger off so I'm not

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
I'm gonna chop the pinger off so I'm not
going<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.429> do<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:54.019> so<00:00:55.019> if<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.499> hit<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
going to do that so if I hit now my

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.819 
going to do that so if I hit now my
finger<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:57.179> a<00:00:57.210> solid<00:00:57.629> lump<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.929> steel<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
finger with a solid lump of steel and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.029 
finger with a solid lump of steel and
break<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.249> finger<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> d3o

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
break my finger but because of the d3o

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.780 
break my finger but because of the d3o
it's<00:01:03.769> absorbing<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.980> dissipating<00:01:05.730> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it's absorbing and dissipating the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's absorbing and dissipating the
energy<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> only<00:01:07.830> fabric<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
energy so this is the only fabric in the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
energy so this is the only fabric in the
world<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.170> does<00:01:10.350> absorb

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
world that actually really does absorb

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.070 
world that actually really does absorb
and<00:01:11.070> dissipate<00:01:11.159> impact<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.870> what<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:15.080> d3

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and dissipate impact so what we do is d3

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.290 
and dissipate impact so what we do is d3
oh<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:17.010> clever<00:01:17.280> guy<00:01:17.490> called<00:01:17.760> Richard<00:01:18.060> Palmer

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
oh very clever guy called Richard Palmer

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.070 
oh very clever guy called Richard Palmer
took<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.410> non-newtonian<00:01:20.370> fabric<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.240> turn

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
took this non-newtonian fabric and turn

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
took this non-newtonian fabric and turn
it<00:01:22.260> into<00:01:22.410> a<00:01:22.530> solid<00:01:22.950> state<00:01:23.190> fabric<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it into a solid state fabric which is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.090 
it into a solid state fabric which is
now<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.440> format<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.910> hit<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
now in this format so now if I hit this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
now in this format so now if I hit this
this<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> same<00:01:29.760> impact<00:01:30.240> properties<00:01:30.780> as

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this has the same impact properties as

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.160 
this has the same impact properties as
this<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.010> what<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.370> do<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.840> solid

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this and what we do is we take the solid

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530 
this and what we do is we take the solid
state<00:01:34.380> fabric<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.760> now<00:01:35.910> integrate<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
state fabric and we now integrate it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.250 
state fabric and we now integrate it
into<00:01:36.690> all<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> our<00:01:37.370> mobile<00:01:38.370> phone<00:01:38.760> cases<00:01:39.260> and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
into all of our mobile phone cases and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.470 
into all of our mobile phone cases and
what<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> does<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.580> offers<00:01:41.730> real<00:01:42.090> impact

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
what that does is it offers real impact

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.800 
what that does is it offers real impact
protection<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.580> see<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.120> on<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
protection so you can see here on the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.420 
protection so you can see here on the
orange<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.260> can<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.620> see<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.010> orange<00:01:47.250> on

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
orange you can just see the orange on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.570 
orange you can just see the orange on
the<00:01:47.460> inside<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> case<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:50.220> OP<00:01:50.430> is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
the inside of the case so now this OP is

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.350 
the inside of the case so now this OP is
really<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.940> protection

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
really in protection

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.270 
really in protection
so<00:01:52.750> when<00:01:52.870> you<00:01:52.990> hit<00:01:53.140> your<00:01:53.290> phone<00:01:53.590> it's<00:01:53.980> being

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
so when you hit your phone it's being

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.370 
so when you hit your phone it's being
absorbed<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.970> dissipating<00:01:55.630> just<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.200> this

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
absorbed and dissipating just like this

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.080 
absorbed and dissipating just like this
soft<00:01:56.860> bone<00:01:57.820> impact<00:01:58.210> it's<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:59.020> rock-hard<00:02:00.090> so

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
soft bone impact it's going rock-hard so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.210 
soft bone impact it's going rock-hard so
we're<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.840> only<00:02:02.050> case<00:02:02.260> manufacturer<00:02:02.980> in<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
we're the only case manufacturer in the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.520 
we're the only case manufacturer in the
world<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.640> actually<00:02:03.760> used<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.570> real<00:02:04.930> impact

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
world that actually used a real impact

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.380 
world that actually used a real impact
protection<00:02:05.830> fabric<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.910> inner<00:02:07.060> core<00:02:07.360> of

our<00:02:07.630> products<00:02:08.050> now<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.860> look<00:02:09.130> at<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.340> other

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
our products now you look at the other

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.190 
our products now you look at the other
competitors<00:02:09.850> out<00:02:10.270> there<00:02:10.330> they're<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:10.750> using

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
competitors out there they're just using

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.920 
competitors out there they're just using
PC<00:02:11.800> which<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.760> lot<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> time<00:02:13.300> polycarb

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
PC which a lot of the time polycarb

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.350 
PC which a lot of the time polycarb
cracks<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.980> when<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> drop<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.880> it's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
cracks so when you drop it it's

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.510 
cracks so when you drop it it's
absorbing<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.620> increasing<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
absorbing and actually increasing the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.970 
absorbing and actually increasing the
energy<00:02:18.670> onto<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.360> phone<00:02:19.570> device<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.680> actually

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
energy onto the phone device so actually
