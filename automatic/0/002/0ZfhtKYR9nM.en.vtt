them I think at this stage in my life

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.420 
them I think at this stage in my life
this<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:10.790> just<00:01:11.259> where<00:01:12.259> I<00:01:12.290> should<00:01:12.409> be<00:01:12.799> I<00:01:13.070> think

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
this is just where I should be I think

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.130 
this is just where I should be I think
the<00:01:13.549> stakes<00:01:13.790> are<00:01:14.030> higher<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.479> think<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.990> we're

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
the stakes are higher I think that we're

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.170 
the stakes are higher I think that we're
at<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.350> time<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:16.040> our<00:01:16.189> country<00:01:16.250> when<00:01:16.759> I<00:01:16.790> think<00:01:17.090> we

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
at a time in our country when I think we

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.510 
at a time in our country when I think we
need<00:01:17.420> people<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:18.290> get<00:01:18.590> involved<00:01:19.219> that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
need people to get involved that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.160 
need people to get involved that
otherwise<00:01:20.119> might<00:01:20.450> not<00:01:20.479> have<00:01:20.659> gotten<00:01:20.899> involved

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
otherwise might not have gotten involved

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.139 
otherwise might not have gotten involved
and<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:21.799> think<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.399> look<00:01:22.700> at<00:01:22.850> our<00:01:22.969> history
