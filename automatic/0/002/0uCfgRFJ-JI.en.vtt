00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.410
 more than ten years 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.539
 in the end the draw 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.659
 all fair 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.659
 if you look at his clients a march against injustice 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.890
 in France we were in place a series of breaks situation and 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.720
 several opportunities before 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.220
 but good place in the polls 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.720
 the difference 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.349
 listen plan large volumes 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 the dam tonight we move slowly 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 these purchases are very critical 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.910
 fly a little less now we are 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 he is still alert 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.090
 here we go again slowly but we advance 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 on stage it's nice 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.290
 salvation will pass by there 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.260
 home games 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.910
 we have a complicated match 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 polanski that makes them outside 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.590
 considering this match 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 however the two minutes 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.580
 point that does not pay anymore 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.530
 the discussion will focus 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820
 tomorrow we always conclude Tunisian theater 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.940
 concentrating 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.290
 we take a point that's all 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.580
 in the oven contained a work denied that will happen 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.390
 we had been predicted a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.650
 the four weeks because it is clear that we would have echoes for me 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.520
 you still have dille 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.290
 in the old hall 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.470
 not that I think we're doing well 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.050
 it is for these two half winds in these moments we have been to 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 sides of m 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.140
 this contract against lille and today we make a good challenge mode 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.120
 think very beefy it's constant in France to take this goal 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.910
 what is it to each of us 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.590
 cci 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.670
 we'll say it's a bit but mostly because it's good 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.920
 armed elements remained the same treatment 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 the one that pushed us 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.740
 besides the one following me that lissandro kivu 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 federer has reached his sad and pathetic 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.290
 vertical 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.630
 in detail look for it for us 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.040
 but as happy as by skype 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.279
 any child subject 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.639
 it is true that it is done 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 to a little frustration 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:17.289
 good match against a very good second 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.239
 in a stable 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.239
 well we take this goal the beat torrent 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.019
 a second france first nation 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.529
 raise our game level 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.249
 I had a lot of opportunities 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.249
 a serious act 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:40.839
 but it's part of the game 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.839
 with some success tonight 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.469
 finally half-time it's safe 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.469
 and then to fatima 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.479
 but we did not do it has no price 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.399
 I had very few opportunities 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.789
 great reporter 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.089
 it's like that since 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.059
 because everyone is concerned
