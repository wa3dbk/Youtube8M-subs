 Your hands are painted with the matrimonial henna 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.430
 You found the man of your dreams.

 My beautiful bride, the most beautiful in the world. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.400
 Take her on a litter 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.550
 When our eyes met for the first time 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.170
 I fell in love with you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.760

 Devote in your love these two words: 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.610
 Earth and Paradise 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.910
 Believe in my promises 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.200
 Heavens and Earth proclaim 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.160
 That there is no other like you 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.410
 Do not do this magic 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.470
 I will not fall for this 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.960
 Stop with the false words 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.110
 Let the pure hearts meet 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.870

 I pray, please, God forgive me. 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.170
 For all my prayers are for you. 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.720
 Oh my love, you know. 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.170
