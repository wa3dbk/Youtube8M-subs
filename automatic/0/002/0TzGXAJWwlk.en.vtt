00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
me make my letter a and it's just the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.470 
me make my letter a and it's just the
top<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:10.910> supposed<00:03:11.240> to<00:03:11.330> be<00:03:13.209> wider<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
top and it's supposed to be wider on the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.170

top and skinnier on the bottom there I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.550 
top and skinnier on the bottom there I
think<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.840> would<00:03:21.020> look<00:03:21.170> good<00:03:22.270> now<00:03:23.270> step<00:03:24.050> 2<00:03:24.319> is

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
think that would look good now step 2 is

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.580 
think that would look good now step 2 is
to<00:03:24.590> take<00:03:25.069> this<00:03:25.400> little<00:03:25.790> piece<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:29.500> can't<00:03:30.500> me

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
to take this little piece out can't me

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.229 
to take this little piece out can't me
punch<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.220> piece<00:03:31.550> out<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.790> we're<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.150> to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239

put<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.600> right<00:03:35.780> at<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.620> top<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.100> skirt

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.860 

yeah

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
yeah

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.430 
yeah
next<00:03:48.560> we<00:03:48.650> put<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.830> top<00:03:49.130> on<00:03:49.600> right<00:03:50.600> through<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
next we put the top on right through the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.750 
next we put the top on right through the
stick<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:53.769> then<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.950> last<00:03:55.130> thing<00:03:55.340> we<00:03:55.459> do<00:03:55.580> is

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
stick and then the last thing we do is

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.000 
stick and then the last thing we do is
we<00:03:55.940> cut<00:03:56.239> out<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.780> funny<00:03:57.200> part<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:57.739> there's<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
we cut out the funny part so there's a

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.759 
we cut out the funny part so there's a
head<00:03:59.530> arms<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.080> head<00:04:06.290> would<00:04:06.410> go<00:04:06.440> on<00:04:06.680> the

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
head arms so the head would go on the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.229 
head arms so the head would go on the
very<00:04:06.980> top<00:04:08.709> head<00:04:09.709> arms<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:10.360> shoes<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:13.239> think

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
very top head arms and shoes I think

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.509 
very top head arms and shoes I think
that<00:04:14.780> when<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.049> put<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.350> head<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:15.650> it's<00:04:16.400> getting

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
that when I put a head on it's getting

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.650 
that when I put a head on it's getting
like<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.760> little<00:04:17.000> funny<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.329> I'm<00:04:17.390> going<00:04:17.600> to

actually<00:04:18.280> make<00:04:19.280> this<00:04:19.609> part<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.120> little<00:04:20.299> bit

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
actually make this part a little bit

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.210 
actually make this part a little bit
skinnier<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:24.380> we<00:04:24.470> go<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.800> looks<00:04:24.830> more

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
skinnier there we go that looks more

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.900

like<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.460> dress

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:41.230 

and<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.060> arms<00:04:33.540> oh<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:37.590> lastly<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.220> shoes
