00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.890
 we do the lifting of the lines 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.970
 we'll say to have a little carry the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.610
 visual information and analyze it in the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.030
 office a series of photos is taken 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:35.310
 which did not get them directly but 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.900
 I've seen different shots with the camera and 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.970
 in one of the shots commanded not 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.060
 I had seen I could not see to appreciate 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.370
 nothing that there is anything strange in 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.440
 reality demanded 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 the air engineer and he has been able 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.059
 appreciate we would say when the view on 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.070
 detail how was there something weird 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.199
 we have the images and they write well 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.260
 it looked like a flying object 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.260
 identified 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.510
 when he sends me by mail to the photos 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.120
 I open it because the gift I wanted to see 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.190
 where the line was going to come and then 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.490
 when I look at the distance in the photo 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.720
 you could see the object that had a shape 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.230
 so apparently like an object 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 unidentified flyer a flying saucer 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.990
 and the broad then with the computer 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.700
 using the zoom I'll expand and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.430
 well you could tell it was an object 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.490
 totally solid in the doubt that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.979
 it could be for example a cloud I see the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.140
 another photo that he also takes out 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.240
 with 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.880
 a time interval should be 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.560
 about a minute then 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.960
 after minutes later the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.510
 object then that photo did not appear in 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.790
 the first one appeared which this one 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.340
 showed that it was not a cloud because it 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.130
 I could have disappeared this later if 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.150
 I have entered the internet and I have seen photos 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.150
 very similar 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.120
 at three in the afternoon there was no 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.110
 cloud 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.270
 but a totally clear day 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.130
 then I go I see it to the photo 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.820
 well then we share it between 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.560
 we 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.280
 and then everything has been shared that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.890
 it's really normal until now 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.300
 true that he had never believed but 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.580
 Seeing this picture apparently 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.580
 it seems that something there 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 then it disappears it's like I know 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.580
 It is not low immediately 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.580
 I get a little scared
