also some people complain about lack of
energy<00:00:30.890> okay<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.610> go<00:00:33.030> through<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.329> with

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
energy okay we all go through it with

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.080 
energy okay we all go through it with
every<00:00:34.110> diet<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.739> go<00:00:34.950> through<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.850> care

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
every diet we go through it I don't care

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
every diet we go through it I don't care
if<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.360> low-fat<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> go

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
if it's low-fat we all kind of go

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
if it's low-fat we all kind of go
through<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.219> our<00:00:38.520> bodies<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
through because our bodies have to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
through because our bodies have to
adjust<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> change<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.800> were<00:00:40.860> doing

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
adjust to the change that we were doing

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
adjust to the change that we were doing
to<00:00:41.550> her<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.629> basically<00:00:43.200> going

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to her to it it's basically going

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.729 
to her to it it's basically going
through<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> shot<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.879> hey<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.750> gotta<00:00:46.020> figure

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
through a shot like hey we gotta figure

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
through a shot like hey we gotta figure
out<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.160> she's<00:00:47.430> doing<00:00:47.730> different<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.329> got

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
out what she's doing different it's got

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.110 
out what she's doing different it's got
to<00:00:48.570> change<00:00:48.600> into<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> new<00:00:49.680> cycle<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.460> things

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to change into the new cycle of things

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.229 
to change into the new cycle of things
worse<00:00:51.329> feel<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> receiving<00:00:52.590> um<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.940> if

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
worse feel that it's receiving um but if

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.619 
worse feel that it's receiving um but if
you<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.079> end<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:56.039> low<00:00:56.640> energy<00:00:57.090> stage

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
you do end up in that low energy stage

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
you do end up in that low energy stage
and<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> introduction<00:01:00.859> have
