00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
you the truth but I would get them all

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.759 
you the truth but I would get them all
uneven<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.849> then<00:03:02.079> you'd<00:03:03.079> have<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.409> cut<00:03:03.650> it

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
uneven and then you'd have to cut it

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.130 
uneven and then you'd have to cut it
down<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.370> make<00:03:04.640> them<00:03:04.940> even<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.629> it<00:03:05.690> wasn't<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
down to make them even and it wasn't the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.750 
down to make them even and it wasn't the
size<00:03:06.349> that<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.650> had<00:03:06.769> intended<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.280> begin<00:03:07.430> with

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
size that I had intended to begin with

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.360 
size that I had intended to begin with
so<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.659> solves<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.230> problem<00:03:09.620> for<00:03:09.829> me<00:03:09.980> love

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
and while that works just fine this is

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.220 
and while that works just fine this is
extremely<00:03:38.660> fast<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.889> actually<00:03:41.139> makes<00:03:42.139> a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
extremely fast and it actually makes a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.250 
extremely fast and it actually makes a
very<00:03:42.349> consistent<00:03:43.030> cake<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.480> yarn<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.079> like

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
very consistent cake of yarn and I like

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.089 
very consistent cake of yarn and I like
the<00:03:45.410> fact<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.680> they're<00:03:45.889> shaped<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.519> cakes

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
the fact that they're shaped in cakes

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.569 
the fact that they're shaped in cakes
like<00:03:49.099> this<00:03:49.599> because<00:03:50.599> they<00:03:50.959> sit<00:03:51.410> flat<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.190> then

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
like this because they sit flat and then

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.030 
like this because they sit flat and then
I'll<00:03:52.699> roll<00:03:52.879> all<00:03:53.060> around<00:03:53.530> it's<00:03:54.530> just<00:03:54.650> pretty

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
I'll roll all around it's just pretty

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.720 
I'll roll all around it's just pretty
handy<00:03:55.430> dandy<00:03:55.609> I<00:03:55.940> always<00:03:56.900> put<00:03:57.230> my<00:03:57.410> yarn<00:03:57.739> labels

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
handy dandy I always put my yarn labels

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.819 
handy dandy I always put my yarn labels
in<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.120> center<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.049> can<00:04:00.319> pull<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.709> and

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
in the center so I can pull it out and

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.059 
in the center so I can pull it out and
see<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.459> know<00:04:01.549> what<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.849> is<00:04:02.620> once<00:04:03.620> they<00:04:03.859> get

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
see you know what it is once they get

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.460 
see you know what it is once they get
smaller<00:04:04.879> though<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.629> usually<00:04:06.079> like<00:04:06.199> like<00:04:06.349> this

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
smaller though I usually like like this

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.740 
smaller though I usually like like this
one<00:04:06.680> still<00:04:06.919> has<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.250> label<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.910> but<00:04:08.359> once<00:04:08.629> I

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
one still has the label in it but once I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.289 
one still has the label in it but once I
start<00:04:09.019> wearing<00:04:09.260> them<00:04:09.470> down<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:10.430> don't<00:04:10.970> bother

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
start wearing them down I don't bother

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.839 
start wearing them down I don't bother
to<00:04:11.480> keep<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.959> label<00:04:12.349> it<00:04:12.889> just<00:04:13.160> becomes<00:04:13.549> more

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
to keep the label it just becomes more

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.849 
to keep the label it just becomes more
cumbersome<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.419> bulky<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.379> know<00:04:15.530> because

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
cumbersome and bulky you know because

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.469 
cumbersome and bulky you know because
it's<00:04:16.039> a<00:04:16.160> smaller<00:04:16.459> thing<00:04:16.849> and<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.120> labels

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
it's a smaller thing and the labels

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.659 
it's a smaller thing and the labels
still<00:04:17.690> big<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:18.139> know<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:18.799> just<00:04:19.070> usually

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
still big you know so I just usually

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:20.879 
still big you know so I just usually
toss<00:04:19.880> it

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
toss it

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.219 
toss it
so<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.699> heard<00:04:21.909> this<00:04:22.120> partial<00:04:22.599> scheme<00:04:22.900> of

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
so I heard this partial scheme of

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.820 
so I heard this partial scheme of
vanna's<00:04:23.770> choice<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> need<00:04:24.759> to<00:04:25.060> cake<00:04:25.419> I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
vanna's choice that I need to cake I

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.290 
vanna's choice that I need to cake I
mean<00:04:26.830> it's<00:04:26.979> fun<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:27.580> really<00:04:27.789> not<00:04:27.939> falling

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
mean it's fun it's really not falling

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.270 
mean it's fun it's really not falling
apart<00:04:28.629> and<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.319> know<00:04:29.439> if<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.740> was<00:04:29.949> still

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
apart and you know if I was still

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.730 
apart and you know if I was still
working<00:04:30.580> on<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> project<00:04:31.719> I<00:04:31.960> probably<00:04:32.229> wouldn't

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
working on a project I probably wouldn't

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.589 
working on a project I probably wouldn't
bother<00:04:32.949> doing<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:33.789> since<00:04:33.969> my<00:04:34.120> project

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
bother doing it but since my project

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.020 
bother doing it but since my project
with<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:34.900> is<00:04:35.080> finished<00:04:35.590> I'm<00:04:36.280> gonna<00:04:36.520> take<00:04:36.789> it

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
with this is finished I'm gonna take it

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.300 
with this is finished I'm gonna take it
so<00:04:37.960> here's<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.560> way<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.710> do<00:04:38.860> it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
so here's the way I do it

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.189 
so here's the way I do it
I<00:04:39.340> find<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.150> end<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.569> I<00:04:40.629> drop<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.990> on<00:04:41.050> the

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
I find the end and I drop it on the

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.369 
I find the end and I drop it on the
ground<00:04:41.439> and<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:43.270> need<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.719> put<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.110> through

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
ground and you need to put it through

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.980 
ground and you need to put it through
this<00:04:44.949> yarn<00:04:45.370> guide<00:04:45.729> so<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.509> see<00:04:46.719> better

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.149 

all<00:04:49.990> right<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.199> we<00:04:50.319> start<00:04:50.620> with<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.860> yarn

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
all right so we start with the yarn

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.429 
all right so we start with the yarn
guide<00:04:51.490> now<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.419> course<00:04:52.599> you<00:04:52.870> could<00:04:53.050> just

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
guide now of course you could just

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.580 
guide now of course you could just
thread<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.610> through<00:04:54.759> like<00:04:55.029> that<00:04:55.439> but<00:04:56.439> it's

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
thread it through like that but it's

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.320 
thread it through like that but it's
made<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:57.009> such<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.279> way<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:57.909> can<00:04:58.120> just

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
made in such a way that you can just

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.600 
made in such a way that you can just
loop<00:04:58.629> it<00:04:58.810> around<00:04:58.870> twice<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:01.090> it's<00:05:01.270> through

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
loop it around twice and it's through

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.119 
loop it around twice and it's through
I'm<00:05:03.610> gonna<00:05:03.759> say<00:05:03.909> that<00:05:04.060> again<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:08.740> loop<00:05:08.979> it

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
I'm gonna say that again you loop it

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.980 
I'm gonna say that again you loop it
around<00:05:09.219> twice<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:13.120> there<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.389> it's<00:05:13.629> a<00:05:13.810> pretty

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
around twice and there it it's a pretty

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.600 
around twice and there it it's a pretty
handy<00:05:14.199> dandy<00:05:14.500> huh<00:05:16.319> okay<00:05:17.319> so<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.620> next<00:05:17.860> step<00:05:18.250> is

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
handy dandy huh okay so the next step is

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.140 
handy dandy huh okay so the next step is
you<00:05:19.360> put<00:05:19.539> it<00:05:19.629> onto<00:05:19.779> the<00:05:20.080> bow<00:05:20.259> under<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.150> the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
you put it onto the bow under and the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.969 
you put it onto the bow under and the
way<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.509> I<00:05:22.599> do<00:05:22.659> it<00:05:22.960> is<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.110> always<00:05:23.349> look<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.800> see

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
way that I do it is I always look to see

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.059 
way that I do it is I always look to see
which<00:05:24.129> end<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:24.639> dipping<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.419> lowest<00:05:26.069> when

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
which end is dipping the lowest when

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.300 
which end is dipping the lowest when
it's<00:05:27.219> facing<00:05:27.460> the<00:05:27.789> back<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.800> slits<00:05:30.129> right

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
it's facing the back so the slits right

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.149 
it's facing the back so the slits right
here<00:05:30.759> it<00:05:31.419> fits<00:05:31.779> through<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.379> just<00:05:32.440> snap<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.039> on

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
here it fits through you just snap it on

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.619 
here it fits through you just snap it on
in<00:05:33.339> there<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:35.669> yeah<00:05:36.669> this<00:05:36.969> is<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.240> right<00:05:37.419> way

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
in there but yeah this is the right way

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.089 
in there but yeah this is the right way
you<00:05:37.960> see<00:05:38.110> how<00:05:38.229> that's<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.560> little<00:05:38.740> bit<00:05:38.889> lower

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
you see how that's a little bit lower

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.089 
you see how that's a little bit lower
than<00:05:39.490> that<00:05:40.080> okay<00:05:41.080> so<00:05:41.139> that's<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.650> way<00:05:41.800> I

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
than that okay so that's the way I

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.839 
than that okay so that's the way I
started<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:42.759> want<00:05:43.000> this<00:05:43.300> in<00:05:43.569> closest<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.759> be

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
started I want this in closest is to be

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.510 
started I want this in closest is to be
the<00:05:45.969> beginning<00:05:46.089> in<00:05:46.509> and<00:05:46.690> that's<00:05:46.839> to<00:05:47.050> be<00:05:47.169> the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
the beginning in and that's to be the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.300 
the beginning in and that's to be the
extra<00:05:48.520> in<00:05:48.750> then<00:05:49.750> I<00:05:49.870> hold<00:05:50.139> it<00:05:50.409> right<00:05:50.560> here<00:05:50.620> for

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
extra in then I hold it right here for

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.059 
extra in then I hold it right here for
tension<00:05:52.120> sake<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.750> just<00:05:53.080> spin<00:05:55.889> and<00:05:56.889> you<00:05:57.039> can

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
tension sake and just spin and you can

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.070 
tension sake and just spin and you can
go<00:05:57.219> really<00:05:57.520> fast<00:05:57.789> you<00:05:58.029> can<00:05:58.210> go<00:05:58.330> as<00:05:58.389> fast<00:05:58.689> as<00:05:59.020> you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
go really fast you can go as fast as you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.939 
go really fast you can go as fast as you
want<00:05:59.500> to<00:06:00.150> as<00:06:01.150> long<00:06:01.210> as<00:06:01.599> your<00:06:01.750> yarn<00:06:02.050> is<00:06:02.439> feeding
