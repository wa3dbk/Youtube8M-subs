00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
or not at all you just see the potential

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and soloqueue that's the first step you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.830 
and soloqueue that's the first step you

that time when you can just kind of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
that time when you can just kind of
experiment<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.220> find<00:01:11.909> stuff<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.360> your

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
champion a lot you need to figure out

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
champion a lot you need to figure out
what<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> team<00:01:16.799> comps<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.850> work

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
around with them after a while teams

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
around with them after a while teams
usually<00:01:20.189> figure<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.299> strengths<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
usually figure out like the strengths of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
usually figure out like the strengths of
the<00:01:22.110> champion<00:01:22.470> Brom<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.490> everyone<00:01:24.060> thought

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the champion Brom was everyone thought

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
the champion Brom was everyone thought
he<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.780> great<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
he was not that great it's not but the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
he was not that great it's not but the
more<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> time<00:01:26.490> goes<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.909> people<00:01:27.240> recognized

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
more the time goes on people recognized

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.319 
more the time goes on people recognized
that<00:01:28.200> Brahmas<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.100> insanely<00:01:29.790> good

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that Brahmas actually insanely good

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
that Brahmas actually insanely good
I<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.590> hard<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.130> bring<00:01:32.310> in

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I don't think it's that hard to bring in

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.999 
I don't think it's that hard to bring in
a<00:01:32.520> new<00:01:32.549> champ<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.200> harder<00:01:34.890> for

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
a new champ it's more like harder for

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
a new champ it's more like harder for
the<00:01:35.130> enemy<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.520> they're<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:35.820> prepared<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the enemy if they're not prepared for

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.390 
the enemy if they're not prepared for
what<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> chamber<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.770> lot<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
what the chamber is you can do a lot of

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
what the chamber is you can do a lot of
picks<00:01:38.640> you'll<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.939> doing<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.240> scrims<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
picks you'll be doing in scrims and you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.929 
picks you'll be doing in scrims and you
have<00:01:39.990> confidence<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> screams<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.549> then

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
have confidence and screams but then

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.160 
have confidence and screams but then
again<00:01:42.030> teams<00:01:42.509> play<00:01:42.720> different<00:01:42.990> instagrams

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
again teams play different instagrams

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.730 
again teams play different instagrams
you're<00:01:44.130> off<00:01:44.909> meta<00:01:45.329> innovative<00:01:45.869> pick<00:01:46.079> could<00:01:46.590> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're off meta innovative pick could be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.380 
you're off meta innovative pick could be
working<00:01:46.950> only<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.149> kinda

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
working only because of that you kinda

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
working only because of that you kinda
just<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> lot<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> faith<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.860> be

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
just have to have a lot of faith and be

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
just have to have a lot of faith and be
