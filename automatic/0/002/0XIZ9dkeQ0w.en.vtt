properly set inside your fingers in this

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.650 
properly set inside your fingers in this
particular<00:02:50.220> bike<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.880> three<00:02:51.180> fingers

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
particular bike is three fingers

slightly loose can't get four fingers in

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.980 
slightly loose can't get four fingers in
there<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.100> little<00:02:56.130> too<00:02:56.430> tight<00:02:56.460> so<00:02:56.990> that's

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
there it's a little too tight so that's

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.640 
there it's a little too tight so that's
what<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.200> go<00:02:58.380> by

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
leave the house I will bump the air

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.180

the issues outfit about 17 to 20 pounds
in<00:03:50.030> reason<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.690> when<00:03:52.080> we<00:03:52.140> get<00:03:52.260> to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
in reason I do this is when we get to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.680 
in reason I do this is when we get to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
toolbox you go straight to the tires

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.980 
toolbox you go straight to the tires
they've<00:03:59.760> got<00:03:59.910> too<00:04:00.060> much<00:04:00.180> air<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:00.450> them<00:04:00.660> anyway

gives you a little better traction but

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.750 
gives you a little better traction but
just<00:04:26.530> makes<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.830> lot<00:04:26.979> quicker<00:04:27.160> when<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:27.520> get<00:04:27.669> to

the other things that we do before we
leave<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.449> house<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:37.930> check<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:39.100> water<00:04:39.340> in

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
the radiators very important if you run

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
I've already said you check the air

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.830 
I've already said you check the air
pressure<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.389> tires

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
pressure in the tires

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.409 
pressure in the tires
one<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.889> first<00:05:24.010> things<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.700> you<00:05:25.180> do

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
one of the first things that you do

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.969 
one of the first things that you do
you're<00:05:26.080> handling<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.560> is<00:05:26.680> going<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.860> be<00:05:26.950> a

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
you're handling this is going to be a

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.290 
you're handling this is going to be a
lot<00:05:27.220> better<00:05:27.430> if<00:05:27.580> you've<00:05:27.700> got<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.030> correct

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
lot better if you've got the correct

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.510 
lot better if you've got the correct
amount<00:05:28.630> of<00:05:28.690> air<00:05:28.810> pressure<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.289> tires

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
amount of air pressure and the tires

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.040 
amount of air pressure and the tires
next<00:05:30.880> thing<00:05:31.000> I<00:05:31.060> do<00:05:31.180> is<00:05:31.270> bleed<00:05:31.450> the<00:05:31.570> forks<00:05:31.930> on

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
next thing I do is bleed the forks on

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.210 
next thing I do is bleed the forks on
this<00:05:32.169> particular<00:05:32.380> bike<00:05:32.710> we've<00:05:32.919> got<00:05:33.099> the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
this particular bike we've got the

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.150 
this particular bike we've got the

this does you press just simply press
the<00:05:38.169> button<00:05:38.200> now<00:05:38.590> let's<00:05:38.889> see<00:05:39.760> any<00:05:39.880> pressure

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
the button now let's see any pressure

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.260 
the button now let's see any pressure
this<00:05:40.690> built<00:05:40.990> up<00:05:41.139> in<00:05:41.289> the<00:05:41.380> forks<00:05:41.760> let<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.910> let

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
this built up in the forks let the let

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.270 
this built up in the forks let the let
the<00:05:43.389> pressure<00:05:43.599> off<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.990> forks<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.590> bike<00:05:45.099> will

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
the pressure off the forks the bike will

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.830 
the pressure off the forks the bike will
handle<00:05:45.580> a<00:05:45.639> lot<00:05:45.760> better<00:05:46.030> it'll<00:05:46.360> ride<00:05:46.599> a<00:05:46.630> lot

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
handle a lot better it'll ride a lot

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.900 
handle a lot better it'll ride a lot
better<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.440> have<00:05:48.160> less<00:05:48.370> problem<00:05:48.760> with

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
better and you have less problem with

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.420 
better and you have less problem with
the<00:05:49.000> fork<00:05:49.240> seals<00:05:51.539> next<00:05:52.539> thing<00:05:52.690> we<00:05:52.840> do<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.430> check

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
the fork seals next thing we do is check

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.850 
the fork seals next thing we do is check
to<00:05:54.460> check<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.120> play<00:05:55.389> on<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.960> clutch<00:05:56.200> the

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
to check the play on the clutch the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.589 
to check the play on the clutch the
collection<00:05:57.280> needs<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.729> have<00:05:57.910> some<00:05:58.389> free

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
collection needs to have some free

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.839 
collection needs to have some free
playing<00:05:58.870> if<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.950> don't<00:06:00.099> have<00:06:00.220> any<00:06:00.370> free<00:06:00.580> play

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
playing if you don't have any free play

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.520 
playing if you don't have any free play
what<00:06:01.330> you're<00:06:01.450> guessing<00:06:01.810> this<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.139> the<00:06:02.169> clutch

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
what you're guessing this is the clutch

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.990 
what you're guessing this is the clutch
he's<00:06:02.710> going<00:06:02.889> to<00:06:02.950> split<00:06:03.220> costs<00:06:03.700> maybe<00:06:03.880> while

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
he's going to split costs maybe while

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.409 
he's going to split costs maybe while
you're<00:06:04.120> on<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.300> track<00:06:05.729> your<00:06:06.729> clutch<00:06:07.090> is<00:06:07.270> going

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
you're on the track your clutch is going

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.730 
you're on the track your clutch is going
to<00:06:07.479> overheat<00:06:07.780> you're<00:06:08.169> going<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:08.349> burn<00:06:08.590> the

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
to overheat you're going to burn the

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.700 
to overheat you're going to burn the
friction<00:06:09.130> discs<00:06:09.310> up<00:06:10.260> cause<00:06:11.260> lots<00:06:11.530> of<00:06:11.650> problems

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
friction discs up cause lots of problems

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.290 
friction discs up cause lots of problems
and<00:06:12.310> you're<00:06:12.610> not<00:06:12.760> going<00:06:12.880> to<00:06:12.940> be<00:06:13.060> getting<00:06:13.150> the

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
and you're not going to be getting the

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.260 
and you're not going to be getting the
power<00:06:13.539> out<00:06:13.690> of<00:06:13.720> the<00:06:13.870> bike

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
power out of the bike

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.500 
power out of the bike
should<00:06:14.570> be<00:06:14.720> so<00:06:15.760> always<00:06:16.760> check<00:06:16.940> your<00:06:17.180> clutch

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
should be so always check your clutch

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
the bike a little bit it'll lean it out

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.360 
the bike a little bit it'll lean it out
to<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.170> point<00:06:36.380> they<00:06:36.590> can<00:06:36.770> overheat<00:06:37.220> because

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
to the point they can overheat because

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.510 
to the point they can overheat because
some<00:06:37.850> problems<00:06:38.240> there

you've got enough fuel in the tank and
from<00:06:46.700> there<00:06:46.970> it's<00:06:47.180> pretty<00:06:47.240> much<00:06:47.660> cracked

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
from there it's pretty much cracked
