00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260 
when I first saw that the module Express

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.410 
when I first saw that the module Express
I<00:00:07.470> said<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.890> know<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.730> they've<00:00:08.970> come<00:00:09.180> up<00:00:09.210> with

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
I said you know now they've come up with

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.850 
I said you know now they've come up with
something<00:00:09.750> we've<00:00:09.990> been<00:00:10.020> needing<00:00:10.350> for<00:00:10.620> quite<00:00:10.830> a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
something we've been needing for quite a

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.369 
something we've been needing for quite a
while<00:00:11.780> what<00:00:12.780> really<00:00:13.459> caught<00:00:14.459> my<00:00:14.730> eye<00:00:14.760> was<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
while what really caught my eye was the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.340 
while what really caught my eye was the
fact<00:00:16.620> that<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.190> had<00:00:17.970> lost<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.480> help<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> in

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
fact that I had lost some help and in

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.980 
fact that I had lost some help and in
the<00:00:19.560> middle<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.010> summer<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.750> saw<00:00:21.750> how

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the middle of one summer and saw how

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.800 
the middle of one summer and saw how
vulnerable<00:00:22.320> i<00:00:22.770> was<00:00:23.040> to<00:00:23.490> having<00:00:24.420> helpful

vulnerable i was to having helpful
around<00:00:24.870> the<00:00:25.050> module<00:00:25.470> builders<00:00:25.860> and<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:27.060> was

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
around the module builders and that was

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.210 
around the module builders and that was
actually<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.810> deciding<00:00:28.620> factor<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.040> whether

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
actually the deciding factor on whether

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
just send two machines to the field

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.970 
just send two machines to the field
alone<00:00:42.079> that<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.409> a<00:00:43.530> great<00:00:43.739> accomplishment

to keep right up with just the two
people<00:00:50.999> and<00:00:51.239> picking<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.319> cotton<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.800> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
people and picking the cotton it is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.009 
people and picking the cotton it is
actually<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.640> cut<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.359> labor<00:00:54.569> down<00:00:54.839> to

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
actually just cut the labor down to

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.380 
actually just cut the labor down to
almost<00:00:55.140> nothing<00:00:55.319> but<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.609> module<00:00:56.969> Express

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
almost nothing but the module Express

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.610 
almost nothing but the module Express
system<00:00:58.319> has<00:00:59.300> has<00:01:00.300> fit<00:01:00.539> our<00:01:01.319> criteria<00:01:01.530> by

system has has fit our criteria by

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.290 
system has has fit our criteria by
eliminating<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> machinery<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
eliminating a lot of machinery in the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.139 
eliminating a lot of machinery in the
field<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:07.500> eliminated<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.700> lot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:10.040> expense

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149

as<00:01:12.149> far<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> module<00:01:13.049> builders<00:01:13.380> Bo<00:01:13.590> buddies

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
as far as the module builders Bo buddies

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
as far as the module builders Bo buddies
and<00:01:14.219> we<00:01:14.880> had<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> pretty<00:01:15.360> efficient<00:01:15.810> thing

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and we had a pretty efficient thing

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.280 
and we had a pretty efficient thing
going<00:01:16.409> honestly<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.810> has<00:01:19.020> shown

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
going honestly but this this has shown

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.529 
going honestly but this this has shown
me<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.719> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> much<00:01:22.350> more

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
me that that it is it is a much more

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.469 
me that that it is it is a much more
profitable<00:01:24.539> situation<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.680> far<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.130> yes<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
profitable situation as far as yes is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.319 
profitable situation as far as yes is

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
my G buildings Bobo prada would have

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.149 
my G buildings Bobo prada would have
picked<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.909> three<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.359> them<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.770> it's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
picked about three of them so it's

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.639 
picked about three of them so it's
amazing<00:02:05.789> that<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.689> two<00:02:06.960> cotton<00:02:07.350> pickers

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
amazing that I take two cotton pickers

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
amazing that I take two cotton pickers
and<00:02:07.679> pick<00:02:08.100> up<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.759> field<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> field

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and pick up go from field to field

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.059 
and pick up go from field to field
doesn't<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.850> simple<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.739> Machine

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
doesn't it it's that simple the Machine

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.920 
doesn't it it's that simple the Machine
finished<00:02:14.580> his<00:02:14.700> field<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.330> dumped<00:02:15.599> its<00:02:15.720> last

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
finished his field and dumped its last

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.170 
finished his field and dumped its last
module<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.769> go

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
module and go

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.670 
module and go
to<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.390> next<00:02:17.569> field<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.260> there's<00:02:18.379> only<00:02:18.500> a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to the next field and there's only a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.130 
to the next field and there's only a
pickup<00:02:19.069> following<00:02:19.609> it<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.719> was

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
pickup following it and that was

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.580 
pickup following it and that was
probably<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.849> biggest<00:02:23.170> dramatic<00:02:24.170> difference

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
probably the biggest dramatic difference

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.789 
probably the biggest dramatic difference
in<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.060> whole<00:02:26.209> system<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.500> struck

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
in in the whole system that that struck

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.550 
in in the whole system that that struck
me<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:28.310> first<00:02:28.579> time<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:28.879> moved<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:30.379> been

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
me the first time we moved and it's been

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.240 
me the first time we moved and it's been
very<00:02:30.829> pleasant<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.719> I<00:02:32.719> sure<00:02:33.620> don't<00:02:33.769> miss<00:02:34.040> all

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
very pleasant and I sure don't miss all

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.140 
very pleasant and I sure don't miss all
that<00:02:34.280> activity<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.810> especially<00:02:36.349> on<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> end

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
that activity and especially on the end

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.940 
that activity and especially on the end
speedy<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.389> fast<00:02:38.659> with<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.139> module<00:02:39.500> Express

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
speedy and fast with the module Express

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.679 
speedy and fast with the module Express
probably<00:02:40.579> about<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.730> minute<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.389> minute<00:02:41.420> and

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
probably about a minute to a minute and

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.020 
probably about a minute to a minute and
a<00:02:41.780> half<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.290> you're<00:02:42.500> you're<00:02:43.310> gone<00:02:43.519> after<00:02:43.819> you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
a half and you're you're gone after you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.490 
a half and you're you're gone after you
unload<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.389> mod<00:02:44.569> you<00:02:44.750> you're<00:02:45.019> back<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.409> the

unload the mod you you're back in the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.770 
unload the mod you you're back in the
field<00:02:45.680> picking<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.849> I<00:02:46.879> think<00:02:47.329> it's<00:02:47.510> better

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
field picking that I think it's better

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.039 
field picking that I think it's better
than<00:02:48.650> where<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.159> built<00:02:49.700> one<00:02:50.030> there<00:02:50.359> because

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
than where you built one there because

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.830 
than where you built one there because
you're<00:02:51.500> not<00:02:51.650> packed<00:02:52.069> in<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.120> dirt<00:02:53.359> quite<00:02:53.689> as

you're not packed in the dirt quite as

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.659 
you're not packed in the dirt quite as
hard<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.319> it<00:02:54.439> makes<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.859> easier<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
hard and it makes it easier on the

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.349 
hard and it makes it easier on the
trucks<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.659> pick<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.109> up<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:58.159> transport<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.329> the

one high end or whatever and we have had

one high end or whatever and we have had
we<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.549> had<00:03:22.729> real<00:03:22.970> good<00:03:23.209> luck<00:03:23.419> doing<00:03:23.629> that

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
we have had real good luck doing that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.430 
we have had real good luck doing that
and<00:03:24.109> had<00:03:24.290> had<00:03:24.739> very<00:03:24.799> very<00:03:25.549> few<00:03:26.389> small<00:03:26.840> modules

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
and had had very very few small modules

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.409 
and had had very very few small modules
and<00:03:28.299> haven't<00:03:29.299> had<00:03:29.389> to<00:03:29.540> pull<00:03:29.720> out<00:03:29.750> at<00:03:30.590> all<00:03:30.769> I

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
and haven't had to pull out at all I

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.800 
and haven't had to pull out at all I
thought<00:03:32.419> maybe<00:03:32.479> that<00:03:33.169> when<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:35.090> would<00:03:35.269> unload

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
thought maybe that when we would unload

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.819 
thought maybe that when we would unload
them<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.139> you<00:03:36.409> with<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.459> being<00:03:37.669> exposed<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.829> win

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
them on you with it being exposed to win

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.710 
them on you with it being exposed to win
on<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.159> very<00:03:40.430> windy<00:03:40.790> day<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.389> would<00:03:41.540> lose<00:03:41.659> a

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
on a very windy day that we would lose a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.009 
on a very windy day that we would lose a
lot<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.109> cotton<00:03:42.530> that's<00:03:43.189> not<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.549> case<00:03:44.019> you

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
lot of cotton that's not the case you

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.110 
lot of cotton that's not the case you
definitely<00:03:45.319> lose<00:03:45.620> more<00:03:46.009> with<00:03:46.759> a<00:03:46.790> conventional

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
definitely lose more with a conventional

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.780 
definitely lose more with a conventional
six<00:03:47.599> Road<00:03:47.810> dumping<00:03:48.229> into<00:03:48.409> a<00:03:48.590> bow<00:03:48.769> buggy<00:03:49.069> and

six Road dumping into a bow buggy and

six Road dumping into a bow buggy and
then<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.030> bow<00:03:50.269> buggy<00:03:50.599> into<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.349> month<00:03:51.590> you
