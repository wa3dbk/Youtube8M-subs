a fully reversible push chair as well

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.890 
a fully reversible push chair as well
now<00:00:18.580> initially<00:00:18.880> as<00:00:19.180> you<00:00:19.300> can<00:00:19.450> see<00:00:19.599> we<00:00:19.750> have<00:00:19.869> got

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
now initially as you can see we have got

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.960 
now initially as you can see we have got
a<00:00:20.050> rain<00:00:20.259> cover<00:00:20.470> on<00:00:20.710> here<00:00:21.009> doesn't<00:00:21.610> go<00:00:21.700> over<00:00:21.880> the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
a rain cover on here doesn't go over the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.819 
a rain cover on here doesn't go over the
whole<00:00:22.180> hood<00:00:22.450> but<00:00:22.750> it<00:00:22.840> does<00:00:22.989> actually<00:00:23.169> zip<00:00:23.590> on

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
whole hood but it does actually zip on

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.729 
whole hood but it does actually zip on
the<00:00:23.890> inside<00:00:24.550> and<00:00:24.910> that<00:00:25.689> just<00:00:26.020> attaches<00:00:26.529> like

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
the inside and that just attaches like

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.120 
the inside and that just attaches like
so<00:00:27.099> so<00:00:27.369> just<00:00:27.579> releasing<00:00:28.119> that<00:00:28.239> part<00:00:28.599> on<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
so so just releasing that part on it

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.830 
so so just releasing that part on it
does<00:00:30.399> look<00:00:30.669> like<00:00:30.880> it's<00:00:31.149> a<00:00:31.239> little<00:00:31.360> bit<00:00:31.570> fiddly

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
does look like it's a little bit fiddly

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.450 
does look like it's a little bit fiddly
but<00:00:32.110> once<00:00:32.320> you<00:00:32.410> get<00:00:32.500> used<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.800> doing<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:33.220> it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
but once you get used to doing it it's

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.700 
but once you get used to doing it it's
actually<00:00:33.610> quite<00:00:33.910> easy<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.510> do<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:35.440> then<00:00:35.530> that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
actually quite easy to do and then that

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.150 
actually quite easy to do and then that
just<00:00:35.739> attaches<00:00:36.550> on<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:36.820> side<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:39.010> it

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
just attaches on the side and how it

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.189 
just attaches on the side and how it
attaches<00:00:39.489> underneath<00:00:40.090> it's<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:40.899> a<00:00:40.989> press

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
attaches underneath it's just a press

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.840 
attaches underneath it's just a press
turd<00:00:41.440> underneath<00:00:41.589> and<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.219> secures

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
turd underneath and that secures

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.069 
turd underneath and that secures
underneath<00:00:43.239> where<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.539> foot<00:00:43.719> rest<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
underneath where the foot rest is so

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.590 
underneath where the foot rest is so

change<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.140> look<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
change the look of it you can do that to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.520 
change the look of it you can do that to
release<00:01:57.399> your<00:01:58.000> upright<00:01:58.600> or<00:01:59.020> your<00:01:59.170> recline

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
release your upright or your recline

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.410 
release your upright or your recline
position<00:02:00.039> it's<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.609> hand<00:02:00.850> hold<00:02:01.149> on<00:02:01.299> the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
position it's just a hand hold on the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.090 
position it's just a hand hold on the
back<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.840> should<00:02:02.079> squeeze<00:02:02.409> in<00:02:02.649> two<00:02:02.799> gray

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
back and that should squeeze in two gray

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.950 
back and that should squeeze in two gray
parts<00:02:03.490> together<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.509> will<00:02:04.659> allow<00:02:04.929> that

on here and uniquely the way that it

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.820 
on here and uniquely the way that it
works<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:13.000> normally

we<00:02:13.890> go<00:02:14.040> down<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.550> wheel<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.940> do<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.210> there

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
we go down to the wheel and do it there

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.560 
we go down to the wheel and do it there
it's<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.530> with<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.520> slides<00:02:18.210> and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
it's not with this it just slides and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
it's not with this it just slides and
it's<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.020> two<00:02:19.230> great<00:02:19.620> buttons<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.190> are

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it's just the two great buttons that are

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640 
it's just the two great buttons that are
on<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> side<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:21.630> allow<00:02:21.870> us<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.230> swivel

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
on the side will allow us to have swivel

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.100 
on the side will allow us to have swivel
wheels<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.330> lock<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.660> off<00:02:24.810> just

pressing that straighten up your wheels
and<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.710> will<00:02:28.860> lock<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.130> off

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and that will lock that off

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and that will lock that off
automatically

those<00:02:30.780> swivel<00:02:31.170> wheels<00:02:31.380> will<00:02:31.620> use<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.040> for

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
those swivel wheels will use that for

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.010 
those swivel wheels will use that for
when<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:32.490> around<00:02:32.610> stores<00:02:33.210> but<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.930> we're

suspension you've also got an added

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.050 
suspension you've also got an added
feature<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:49.950> well<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.430> I've<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.790> one

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
feature on here as well and I've got one

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.199 
feature on here as well and I've got one
and<00:02:51.330> two<00:02:51.720> positions<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.550> extra<00:02:53.550> suspension

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and two positions for extra suspension

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.780 
and two positions for extra suspension
now<00:02:55.140> initially<00:02:55.470> you'll<00:02:55.800> have<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.280> one<00:02:56.580> one

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
now initially you'll have it on one one

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.400 
now initially you'll have it on one one
we've<00:02:56.910> got<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> lighter<00:02:57.450> weight<00:02:57.750> child<00:02:58.140> in

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
we've got a lighter weight child in

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.530 
we've got a lighter weight child in
there<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:59.310> when<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.910> actually<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.360> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
there but when we do actually have a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.000 
there but when we do actually have a
slightly<00:03:00.900> heavier<00:03:01.170> child<00:03:01.680> or<00:03:01.830> if<00:03:01.890> you're

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
slightly heavier child or if you're

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.400 
slightly heavier child or if you're
going<00:03:02.130> over<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.490> really<00:03:03.030> rough<00:03:03.209> ground<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
going over that really rough ground and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.110 
going over that really rough ground and
what<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:04.920> turn<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.640> round<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
what you do is just turn that round and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.330 
what you do is just turn that round and
what<00:03:06.330> will<00:03:06.450> happen<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.560> gives<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.040> much

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
what will happen is it gives you much

sturdier suspension so again an extra
little<00:03:11.340> feature<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.970> might<00:03:12.000> not<00:03:12.420> find

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
little feature that you might not find

and releasing off with the blue will

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.310 
and releasing off with the blue will
then<00:03:27.239> allow<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.840> maneuver<00:03:28.769> off<00:03:29.100> again<00:03:30.320> now

I<00:03:31.590> did<00:03:31.830> say<00:03:32.010> earlier<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:33.150> reversible<00:03:33.810> and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
I did say earlier it's reversible and

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.229 
I did say earlier it's reversible and
it's<00:03:34.980> really<00:03:35.340> easy<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.790> grey<00:03:36.000> button

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
it's really easy it's the grey button

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.810 
it's really easy it's the grey button

there don't have to press them both
together<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.600> want<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.410> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
together but if you want to you can and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.030 
together but if you want to you can and
then<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.489> lifting<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.000> whole<00:03:42.239> thing<00:03:42.540> up

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
then just lifting the whole thing up

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.860 
then just lifting the whole thing up
turning<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.160> round<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.730> will<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.600> go<00:03:45.780> around

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
turning it round it will just go around

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.030 
turning it round it will just go around
the<00:03:46.080> other<00:03:46.170> way<00:03:47.720> initially<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:49.470> as<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> tip

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
the other way initially just as a tip

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.640 
the other way initially just as a tip
when<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.910> are<00:03:51.090> putting<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.810> put<00:03:52.050> one<00:03:52.290> side

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
when you are putting it in put one side

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.340 
when you are putting it in put one side
in<00:03:52.920> first<00:03:53.160> because<00:03:54.150> what<00:03:54.360> will<00:03:54.510> happen<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:55.019> it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
in first because what will happen is it

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.530 
in first because what will happen is it
will<00:03:55.590> fold<00:03:55.890> down<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.519> being<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
will fold down with that being on the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.600 
will fold down with that being on the
unit<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.380> if<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.650> make<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.280> looks<00:03:59.519> like

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
unit so if I make that so looks like

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.330 
unit so if I make that so looks like
it's<00:03:59.910> squashed<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.450> slightly<00:04:01.310> easing<00:04:02.310> that

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
it's squashed in slightly easing that

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.060 
it's squashed in slightly easing that
part<00:04:02.820> over<00:04:03.090> we'll<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:04.019> make<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.380> nice<00:04:04.800> and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
part over we'll just make that nice and

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.479 
part over we'll just make that nice and
easy<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.760> pop<00:04:05.940> into<00:04:06.269> position<00:04:07.340> now<00:04:08.340> as

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
easy for you to pop into position now as

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.370 
easy for you to pop into position now as
I've<00:04:08.610> already<00:04:08.760> said<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.360> will<00:04:09.660> fold<00:04:09.959> down<00:04:10.080> with

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
I've already said it will fold down with

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.470 
I've already said it will fold down with
your<00:04:10.500> seat<00:04:10.709> unit<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.820> I'm<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.269> take

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
your seat unit on but I'm going to take

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.030 
your seat unit on but I'm going to take
it<00:04:12.660> off<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.930> make<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.230> slightly<00:04:13.470> easier<00:04:13.920> for

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
it off to make it slightly easier for

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.920 
it off to make it slightly easier for
you<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.280> see<00:04:14.459> how<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.820> goes<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.360> just<00:04:15.570> removing

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
you to see how it goes so just removing

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.430 
you to see how it goes so just removing
that<00:04:20.330> right<00:04:21.330> we're<00:04:21.870> going<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.020> do<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> folding

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
that right we're going to do the folding

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.790 
that right we're going to do the folding
down<00:04:22.710> part<00:04:23.039> i've<00:04:23.810> got<00:04:24.810> locked<00:04:25.050> off<00:04:25.260> wheels<00:04:25.560> I

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
down part i've got locked off wheels I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.230 
down part i've got locked off wheels I
suggest<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.520> your<00:04:26.789> wheels<00:04:26.970> locked

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
suggest that you have your wheels locked

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.540 
suggest that you have your wheels locked
off

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
off

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.399 
off
because<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:27.849> is<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.000> free-standing<00:04:28.300> unit<00:04:29.199> once

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
because it is a free-standing unit once

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.430 
because it is a free-standing unit once
we<00:04:29.620> folded<00:04:30.039> it<00:04:30.190> down<00:04:30.690> now<00:04:31.690> remember<00:04:32.199> how<00:04:32.379> we

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
we folded it down now remember how we

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.980 
we folded it down now remember how we
adjusted<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.099> handle<00:04:33.430> up<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.699> down<00:04:33.960> when<00:04:34.960> I

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
adjusted the handle up and down when I

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.439 
adjusted the handle up and down when I
got<00:04:35.319> drop<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.650> handle<00:04:36.009> down<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:37.060> whole<00:04:37.240> thing

got drop the handle down the whole thing

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.420 
got drop the handle down the whole thing
starts<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.870> go<00:04:37.990> down<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.470> also<00:04:38.620> shows<00:04:38.979> you<00:04:39.159> red
