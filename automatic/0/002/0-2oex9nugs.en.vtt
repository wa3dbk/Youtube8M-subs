I'm<00:00:04.940> sure<00:00:05.540> everybody<00:00:05.930> wants<00:00:06.080> to<00:00:06.200> know<00:00:06.319> how<00:00:06.380> to

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
I'm sure everybody wants to know how to

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:47.180 
I'm sure everybody wants to know how to
develop<00:00:06.859> and<00:00:07.220> enhance<00:00:07.309> their<00:00:07.729> speed

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 

basically<00:00:48.190> what<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.430> like<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:48.730> do<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:49.090> practice

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
basically what I like to do is practice

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.200 
basically what I like to do is practice
basic<00:00:50.710> rudiments<00:00:51.040> such<00:00:51.430> as<00:00:51.610> singles<00:00:52.030> doubles

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
basic rudiments such as singles doubles

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.619 
basic rudiments such as singles doubles
and<00:00:52.629> paradiddles<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:54.010> long<00:00:54.129> periods<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.489> time

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and paradiddles for long periods of time

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.000 
and paradiddles for long periods of time
repetitiously<00:00:55.629> not<00:00:56.170> only<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.590> drums<00:00:56.800> but

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
repetitiously not only on the drums but

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.890 
repetitiously not only on the drums but
also<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.670> surfaces<00:00:58.239> with<00:00:58.420> little<00:00:58.690> or<00:00:58.870> no

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
also on surfaces with little or no

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.770 
also on surfaces with little or no
rebound<00:00:59.440> such<00:01:00.250> as<00:01:00.370> pillows<00:01:00.670> also<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.420> like<00:01:01.750> to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
rebound such as pillows also I like to

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.869 
rebound such as pillows also I like to
practice<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.350> sticks<00:01:02.830> that<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.610> little

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
practice with sticks that a little

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.310 
practice with sticks that a little
heavier<00:01:04.210> than<00:01:04.300> what<00:01:04.510> I<00:01:04.540> usually<00:01:04.930> play<00:01:05.110> with

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
heavier than what I usually play with

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.440 
heavier than what I usually play with
such<00:01:05.920> as<00:01:06.070> marching<00:01:06.430> band<00:01:06.610> sticks<00:01:06.910> this<00:01:07.300> will

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
such as marching band sticks this will

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.999 
such as marching band sticks this will
help<00:01:07.600> build<00:01:07.810> up<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.020> strength<00:01:08.530> within<00:01:08.830> your

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
help build up the strength within your

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.980 
help build up the strength within your
wrist<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.520> arms<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.300> also<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:10.840> like<00:01:10.960> to

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
wrist and arms and also I like to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.820 
wrist and arms and also I like to
stretch<00:01:11.320> too

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
stretch too

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.020 
stretch too
it<00:01:12.040> kind<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.490> helps<00:01:12.729> out<00:01:12.850> with<00:01:12.970> the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
it kind of helps out with the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.880 
it kind of helps out with the
flexibility<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.900> all<00:01:14.110> plays<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> role<00:01:14.680> and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
flexibility it all plays a role and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.920 
flexibility it all plays a role and
developing<00:01:15.670> your<00:01:15.790> speed<00:01:16.060> let's<00:01:16.509> talk<00:01:16.690> about<00:01:16.810> a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
developing your speed let's talk about a

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.380 
developing your speed let's talk about a
technique<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:18.009> also<00:01:18.250> applies<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.090> building

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
technique that also applies to building

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.389 
technique that also applies to building
speed<00:01:19.600> call<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.229> molar<00:01:20.410> technique<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:21.070> learned

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
speed call the molar technique I learned

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.889 
speed call the molar technique I learned
this<00:01:21.490> technique<00:01:21.700> from<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.420> drummer<00:01:22.660> by<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
this technique from a drummer by the

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.440 
this technique from a drummer by the
name<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.350> Jim<00:01:23.680> Chapin<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.340> very<00:01:24.970> good<00:01:25.149> friend<00:01:25.390> of

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
name of Jim Chapin a very good friend of

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.969 
name of Jim Chapin a very good friend of
mine<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.869> purpose<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.380> Moller<00:01:26.560> technique

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
mine the purpose of the Moller technique

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.430 
mine the purpose of the Moller technique
is<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.430> help<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.700> play<00:01:27.880> faster<00:01:28.450> for<00:01:29.140> longer

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
is to help you play faster for longer

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.620 
is to help you play faster for longer
periods<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.770> time<00:01:29.830> with<00:01:30.640> more<00:01:30.850> power<00:01:31.119> more

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
periods of time with more power more

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.230 
periods of time with more power more
efficiently<00:01:32.170> using<00:01:32.920> less<00:01:33.250> energy<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.850> so

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
efficiently using less energy and so

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.999 
efficiently using less energy and so
practicing<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.320> technique<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.890> definitely

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
practicing this technique is definitely

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.499 
practicing this technique is definitely
going<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.460> help<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.759> with<00:01:36.970> building<00:01:37.300> speed

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
going to help you with building speed

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.450 
going to help you with building speed
basically<00:01:38.500> it's<00:01:38.710> fairly<00:01:38.920> simple

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
basically it's fairly simple

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.830 
basically it's fairly simple
the<00:01:39.610> Moeller<00:01:39.789> technique<00:01:39.880> consists<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.630> three

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
the Moeller technique consists of three

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.040 
the Moeller technique consists of three
strokes<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.860> first<00:01:42.100> stroke<00:01:42.399> is<00:01:42.930> called<00:01:43.930> the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
strokes the first stroke is called the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.180 
strokes the first stroke is called the
whipping<00:01:44.440> stroke<00:01:44.649> that's<00:01:44.830> why<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:44.979> like<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
whipping stroke that's why I like the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.980 
whipping stroke that's why I like the
karlon<00:01:45.520> it's<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.820> Down<00:01:46.030> stroke<00:01:46.360> basically<00:01:46.869> what

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
karlon it's a Down stroke basically what

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.630 
karlon it's a Down stroke basically what
you<00:01:47.110> want<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.289> try<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.500> do<00:01:47.709> is<00:01:47.920> develop<00:01:48.280> a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you want to try to do is develop a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.249 
you want to try to do is develop a
waving<00:01:49.300> motion<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.780> your<00:01:49.899> hand

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
waving motion in your hand

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.949 
waving motion in your hand
in<00:01:50.459> one<00:01:51.459> single<00:01:51.700> motion<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:52.539> is<00:01:52.720> going<00:01:52.899> to

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
in one single motion this is going to

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.169 
in one single motion this is going to
allow<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.709> be<00:01:54.130> free<00:01:54.459> and<00:01:54.640> also<00:01:54.970> play<00:01:55.149> with

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
allow you to be free and also play with

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:03.320 
allow you to be free and also play with
more<00:01:55.509> power<00:01:55.750> without<00:01:56.140> using<00:01:56.770> as<00:01:56.920> much<00:01:57.340> energy

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.550 

make<00:02:04.330> sure<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.599> get<00:02:04.720> this<00:02:04.869> whipping<00:02:05.080> action

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
make sure you get this whipping action

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.749 
make sure you get this whipping action
it's<00:02:05.679> very<00:02:05.830> important<00:02:08.069> ok<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.220> second<00:02:09.580> stroke

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
it's very important ok the second stroke

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's very important ok the second stroke
is<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.270> tap<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:17.080> third<00:02:17.319> stroke<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
is a tap and the third stroke is the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.910 
is a tap and the third stroke is the
upstroke<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.840> usually<00:02:20.260> generated<00:02:20.380> from<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
upstroke is usually generated from the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.370 
upstroke is usually generated from the
elbow<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.569> once<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:22.630> put<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.870> together<00:02:22.959> it

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
elbow and once you put it together it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.870 
elbow and once you put it together it
comes<00:02:23.680> out<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.099> triple<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.520> pretty<00:02:24.730> much

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
comes out to be triple it's pretty much

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.550 
comes out to be triple it's pretty much
on<00:02:25.030> each<00:02:25.180> hand<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.170> I'm<00:02:26.260> going<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.440> demonstrate

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
on each hand so I'm going to demonstrate

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:44.320 
on each hand so I'm going to demonstrate
that<00:02:26.800> for<00:02:26.950> you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:03:00.350 

sango's<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.510> other<00:02:45.630> hand<00:02:59.270> put<00:03:00.270> them

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
sango's with other hand put them

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.110 
sango's with other hand put them
together<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.950> get<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.280> pretty<00:03:02.520> fast<00:03:02.820> single

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
together you get a pretty fast single

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:35.670 
together you get a pretty fast single
stroke<00:03:03.300> roll

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.340 

the<00:03:36.680> molar<00:03:36.890> technique
