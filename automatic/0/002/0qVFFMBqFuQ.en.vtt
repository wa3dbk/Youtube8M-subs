00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.760
 [Music] 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:17.980
 [Applause] 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:21.340
 ibeas for singing I have a system of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.890
 tutoring different novelty that we 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.169
 allows to speed up the work in the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 greenhouses of any kind 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.410
 product that we are cultivating so much 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.070
 pea bean tomato also we can 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.710
 use in grape crops that is very 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.320
 important for the tutor system at 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.410
 work for a system of a tape that 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.680
 allows us to tie much more 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.769
 versatile and much faster speeds us 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.050
 much more processes in crops 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.170
 of tomato in the box right now we're 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.570
 looking at it this system allows us to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.210
 when we do the manipulation of 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.370
 plant we do not have so much loss of 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.680
 bloom at the moment we have 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.790
 been running a tutor system to which 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.220
 it allows us to totally roll up the bush 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.100
 this tutorial system by changing the way 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.240
 of how you should tutor this system to me 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.360
 lets have 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 totally the green raffia that we have 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.149
 here in this tutor system 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.610
 totally free we do not have to do the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.409
 wrapping complete with normally what 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.259
 we do on the stem but this 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.960
 system allows us that the tutor ado 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.899
 we are held by a hook 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.119
 metallic and he is not going to move from the site 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.240
 where are we going to have directly the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.610
 tutor to this machine has some 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.549
 very important benefits in terms of 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:53.440
 management part is a machine that is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.229
 barely weighs a pound we're 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.229
 talking about 500 grams very easy for the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.509
 manipulation of women men or the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.549
 person who is doing the doctorate 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.860
 it's easy to learn this 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.470
 practically one person in 10 20 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.810
 minutes you take the practice to the system 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.120
 the tutor at one of the benefits that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.810
 has also is that he manages a tape 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.910
 which is biodegradable this allows us to 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.799
 that the tape in the course of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.069
 tutor system where we are 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.540
 speaking a period of 5 to 6 months 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.879
 the plant the ribbon is going to degrade 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.760
 then it is a tape that allows us not 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.370
 do not have pollution in the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.219
 greenhouses and this is a great help 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.620
 to the environment with a small 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.500
 click 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.950
 makes us the perfect subjection in the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.780
 tomato stem or cucumber stem or in 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 the same bean a person 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.620
 quietly in a minute you can have 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.260
 about 50 tutorates in a minute 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.280
 in one hand you kill us 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.950
 groove 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 we are structuring one by one and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.180
 having the person to practice 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.500
 necessary you can tutor around 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.500
 50 bushes
