00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 Today I explain to you again 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.330
 Roundabout on the B 2 with the new ones 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.090
 Lines in it have a little something in it 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.070
 the problem is always improved 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.750
 nor the radical way of driving of some 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.910
 they just rush too fast and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.939
 think that the race track but see 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.939
 even 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.820
 A roundabout on the highway 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.920
 with two lanes or more 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.490
 lane I can on two variants 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.080
 cruise 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.000
 first variant and that's just that 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.890
 Principle on the country road it applies 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 right-hand drive is the right one 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 lane I'm going now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.160
 take and round it all over 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.160
 rotate 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.690
 when entering you have to pay attention 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.650
 that nobody is there that no one is there 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.510
 it could also be that one after 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.420
 on the right can change in the vicinity 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.460
 of reinfahren stay on the right 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.070
 lane about 30 km h 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.820
 I 've got everyone around with mine 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.140
 look in the mirror can also like times 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.770
 an overtaking is he inner 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770
 lane 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 Of course, when driving out, pay attention 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.800
 that nobody is wrong and that I am 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.800
 brought out 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.640
 the second variant of the circle 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.460
 driven on the roundabout 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.530
 I take when, for example, if one 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.770
 slower in front of me, I take that 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.270
 left lane 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.340
 I could overtake under circumstances 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.010
 that it is not the moment at the moment 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.540
 but it is also use 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.450
 illustrate the whole look 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.790
 if one is in the circle there is also 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.860
 of course I wait until everything is free 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.110
 is free until both lanes are free 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.880
 if that's important then I'll switch right away 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.880
 on the left lane in the circle 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.910
 if I want to leave somewhere then 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.259
 of course you turn right over 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.050
 change there is the important the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.450
 traffic observation how to get there 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.450
 is irrelevant to see shaved 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.580
 and then I leave the circle again 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.140
 the safe variant is in every case 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.540
 the first variant 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.880
 I stay on the right side it is 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.830
 namely a misconception that if you are 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.180
 on the right lane is like 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.480
 leave circle at the next exit 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.960
 I have to go completely circle 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.550
 drive through 10 12 times no matter how many times 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.160
 the right side it applies on the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.820
 LadenstraÃŸe also the rechtsfahrgebot so 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.709
 I do not observe any human being there 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.690
 the right side if I want 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.600
 Of course, now over overhauling alternately 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.600
 no matter the color rider in the circle 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.820
 leave at the next exit here 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.420
 the most important thing with such 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.110
 node point at a roundabout is 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.730
 however, that I have the 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.680
 traffic observation not negligible 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.020
 I always have to know what is around me 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.300
 around what is left of me in the mirror 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.120
 to see what is possibly right next to 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.190
 me the whole with 30 km h 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.810
 You can see that very well 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.860
 can also use the lane with the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.330
 can change fans 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.130
 the most important is the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.660
 traffic observation and the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.860
 speed if I'm slow enough 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.380
 then I have everything under control 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.420
 including the traffic management there 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.580
 does anyone come in ? I change anyway 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.520
 after observation to the right 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.050
 facing 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.070
 and can the roundabout perfect 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.070
 leave without danger 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.080
 that 's it in a circle rather there 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.180
 there is really nothing to say 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.100
 I am in the innkreis and not at all over 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.910
 you can change to get out there 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.770
 a variant 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.270
 I stay one more round in the circle and 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.840
 at some point just change over that 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.840
 is working
