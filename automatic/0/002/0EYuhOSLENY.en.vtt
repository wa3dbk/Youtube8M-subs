00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.170
 good evening everyone 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 This time 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 I would like to introduce the 3ds ds software I have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:26.970
 First of all, click here Winning Eleven 3 d sutter 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.830
 Here it guesses operability is too little difficult 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:37.180
 I felt it was a boring game 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.180
 But the graphic was amazing because it was the first software I bought 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.780
 jal Dano at the time of the legendary Ocarina 3 d 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 Here is the story 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:54.400
 I really felt that what deeply interesting 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 The graphics are pretty pretty 3d 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.160
 Beneath I felt it there is a sense of realism 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.290
 Love Plus 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:10.510
 New minute class but 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.510
 It is a work on activation in 3ds ds as Love Plus series 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:19.430
 This is 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:23.290
 I received the impression that it is difficult to understand how to proceed 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.350
 Hey now suddenly the game is over 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.350
 I was disappointed but it was fun 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.560
 This is a popular monster hunter 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.580
 This has not played so much 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.090
 In wii u 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.579
 It means that you 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.579
 I want to play carefully from now on 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.229
 Mario kart line 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.990
 I was addicted at first , but I felt a little tired 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.319
 But if you say it floats, I think there will probably be more 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.710
 Super Mario 3d Land 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 Here too 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:22.880
 I enjoyed it a little 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.880
 Gradually and go according to the difficult course but 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.590
 Beneath rut is will come a little out 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.590
 But the number of 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.730
 It is fun to know the route 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.120
 New mind class 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 This is a game that enjoys a eye 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.450
 nemo 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:54.010
 It is difficult to write if it is 3less but maybe it is 3dsll 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.010
 MAY easy to write 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:07.760
 Forest How villa to animals that came out this is the game that I have also quite addicted 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.550
 It seems to have become the bestseller product in people interlocking 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.140
 that's all 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:19.220
 I'm nervous and explain 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.220
 There are places that are missing, but please understand
