00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.140
 because there is no regulation that obliges the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.400
 advertisements 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.709
 report exclusively 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.829
 about the product they sell 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.529
 and point 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.289
 because if there are advertisers 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.419
 and especially the big brands that sell more and advertise more 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.500
 they would have to stop doing this kind of ads 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.310
 in which the only message you receive is 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 you want to take the girl 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.890
 you wear this clothes you want to be smarter you drive that car you want 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.350
 look more powerful 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.790
 light that clock 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.630
 if we accept this 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.320
 We accept that the ads 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.940
 can be something other than information about the product of 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 information that educate and the community 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 yes what can 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.450
 frivolous and freely 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.000
 connect 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.540
 brands for products with Cuban qualities 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.110
 and what do we have 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 we have generations of people 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.159
 believing that we are what we have 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.050
 I want to be 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.130
 smart 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.300
 take you to the girl 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 and powerful buy the watch the clothes 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.570
 and the car 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410
 you do not have money to buy it 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410
 then you're nobody until you buy it 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.490
 mental confusion 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 spiritual vacuum 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.660
 exacerbated consumerism 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.850
 what are we surprised 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420
 a simple regulation 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.040
 announces something is coming what do you sell tell me about the product 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 no magic I did not sign no manipulation 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.909
 public information ura that goes to your product 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.950
 with this information 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.270
 we would learn 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.529
 we would know more and as we learn we would be choosing 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.529
 more and better and that 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:19.099
 would make a big difference without this information because we stay like 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.449
 let's go accelerated to crash at a speed of vertigo 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.629
 and to get to a point where in the end when this is already a sÃ¡lvese who 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.279
 can society 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.239
 let's think then 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.239
 we deserved it we are guilty 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.889
 you're not smarter powerful and you take the girl to buy those 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 products but to know 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:52.529
 and know about them having the information about them and then you go out and they suit you 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.159
 to you ohno
