00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.519
 hello, I'm chris, okay, we're here 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.170
 in a new video and this time I'm going to 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.030
 show a new template in which 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.400
 we will have all transfers to the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.490
 moment and also all the rookies already 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.490
 added in both free agents and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.230
 the teams are going to see it in the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.210
 description you have the link to see 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.580
 what data do you have to look for in prices 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.619
 there are four and also what data to look for in 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.619
 xbox one in the description very 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.150
 important the description always in 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.740
 play if they are four we are going to creator of 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.870
 templates to keep this 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.000
 template for us I recommend 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.039
 look for it every week to see if any 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.430
 new or not and so have it updated 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.140
 but to keep it that way I'm saved 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.579
 like to save certain templates for 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.390
 that they appear to me above whenever the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.149
 I am looking for it, I give it here to create a template 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.309
 will load the list and we will look for the 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.250
 that we are interested in right now 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.129
 we would give the triangle and look for it 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.399
 by and online then the online idea 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.710
 that we have to search for this case is 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.250
 the next in play are four 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 memories if you want to do it in x 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.990
 you have to use it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.960
 you have to look for it in the description 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.479
 easier 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.450
 we put this username we look for 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.570
 and we found three templates so in the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.159
 that we are interested in is the one above 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.680
 2015-2016 with all the rookies with 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.360
 all the novices and in news if 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 we see that there are 10 that every time there 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.440
 some change that goes up a new 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.450
 updated template because it adds a 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.610
 number with which for that reason I tell you that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.290
 check from time to time that you go 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.710
 entering and if that number has increased 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.890
 as the new template you may keep him 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.929
 we select the template that we want 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.149
 not that they download the template and 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.970
 here we keep it with the name that 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.020
 we like it better 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.240
 I put 15-16 rookies and so I know 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.549
 this template to refer it 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.549
 we keep and we will see for example 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.270
 in the knicks that we have here to port 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.730
 thing it's already here we have created it there 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.140
 You see we have also in Orlando 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.420
 we have sonia 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.780
 there you have also 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.760
 we have who else we have because we 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.700
 we go to minnesota timberwolves and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.680
 we are looking for card anthony towns so here 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.069
 we have also created we are going to 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.890
 lakers in law that we have for example to 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.750
 d'angelo russell with that number one and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.360
 for example if we go to agents 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.209
 free we have aldridge ellis and rondo 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.400
 and the biggest for players that have 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.620
 gone to the free agent market and that 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.540
 are they looking for a new team or their 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.720
 same team but to pay you something else 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.940
 we also go down here in this creator of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.430
 templates in free agents 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.790
 we'll see how there are players created here 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.220
 we have to do and osman we have here to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.010
 guillermo hernangÃ³mez spanish 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.230
 there you see it now it will load the image and 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.049
 also what most has called me the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.549
 attention also we have arinze onuaku 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.430
 from syracuse 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.489
 here we have the rejoinder we have for 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.640
 there data me and what interests us most 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.840
 daniel 10 is here and looks like 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.190
 much more than when 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.590
 2k had him the staff of Real Madrid 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.180
 I do not know if he became black as 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.160
 I think that it became 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.130
 black in the last year at 14 but 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.420
 and here we are seeing 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.680
 well done to me it seems a lot 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.230
 I do not know if with the latest updates 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.900
 they would change his face or not but good 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.690
 here we have it once we have the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.240
 we save it and we can use it 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.240
 while in my league we can use it in 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.340
 the big bucks my manager we can use in 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.350
 Quick game as you are going to see now is 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.050
 very simple in majer in the manager 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.780
 create a new custom template 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.180
 activated and it's going to appear up there 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.160
 15-16 rookies ice pick and play 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.560
 already with the teams with the rookies 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.450
 posts if you want to make a league 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.030
 exactly the same and if you want to play a 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.160
 match of the nba with some of your 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.980
 fast-game friends you give to 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.080
 triangle and you also load the template 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.590
 once loaded, you are going to see 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.180
 example in Orlando not in the knicks that 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.290
 is here because sporting is already the owner 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.910
 there you have it if you want to play with 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.650
 your friends and others can not 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.500
 play online you already know the templates of 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.810
 these can only be played offline but 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.460
 to make a may in the manager or so 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.600
 Well, I think it's pretty good in this 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.660
 summer time 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.270
 in the description if they are 4 and xbox one 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.650
 you have all the data there and every time 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.020
 that are updating will update 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.180
 in the forum of pressing or sports all 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.190
 the news so nothing if it has 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.340
 liked to like and favorites and we 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.340
 we see in the next video bye bye
