00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.120
 now we are near the second bush 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.610
 the year of vegetation on the bush we have developed 5 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.039
 ran for normal development to us 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.490
 enough to leave and we run 4 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.680
 grow 4 sleeves 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.720
 what preference should be given to escape 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.830
 We prefer to escape which 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.140
 develop more below the bottom here 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.380
 which develops from above just in 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.380
 this case is not weaker than we remove 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:42.140
 Now we left on the bush 4 escape 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:45.019
 preference was escape he was given those 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.789
 that grow with more than just not developed 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.609
 from the lower ear with little eyes 4 win 4 into 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.850
 future sleeves 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:59.359
 after a heavy rain the ground in the pit we 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.690
 loose to a depth of five to ten 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.690
 centimeters 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:14.240
 very important on chernozem on loam and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:18.200
 on heavy in the mini flock soil on the second 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.050
 year at us we see naughty to left in 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.270
 the size of the first year when we planted 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.300
 grape well we had 25 centimeters 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.810
 the first two years it persists in such 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.190
 same sizes contribute to laying 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.360
 lower main heel roots 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.490
 scattered roots in this case we have 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.490
 not observed and we have the opportunity 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 grow 4 escapes future sleeves knowing 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.570
 then we will easily make them 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.440
 sloping to ease our shelters 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.740
 the next years task 2 years to grow 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.560
 four strong escape and so they 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.590
 summoned at length enough for 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.010
 forming sleeves for this we remove 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 stepchildren during the summer and autumn either with 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.240
 the second half of August do 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.090
 potassium phosphate dressing for 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.700
 to make a good return 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.140
 in the second year allowed for 4 escape 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.650
 leave one inflorescence to check 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.650
 control grade
