00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.780 
attend equal balls and because those
very<00:03:54.930> sticky<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.650> i<00:03:55.680> will<00:03:56.780> put<00:03:57.780> as<00:03:58.140> with<00:03:58.790> olive

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
very sticky so i will put as with olive

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.620 
very sticky so i will put as with olive
oil<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:01.260> my<00:04:01.410> hand<00:04:01.650> or<00:04:01.890> any<00:04:02.280> type<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.580> olive<00:04:03.030> to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
oil in my hand or any type of olive to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.949 
oil in my hand or any type of olive to
prevent<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.380> dough<00:04:04.650> stick<00:04:05.070> my<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.730> my<00:04:05.850> head<00:04:06.060> so

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
prevent the dough stick my to my head so

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.060 
prevent the dough stick my to my head so
take<00:04:07.230> like<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.640> it's<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> first<00:04:09.000> one

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:22.099 

second<00:04:13.070> one

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.969 

so<00:04:22.770> good<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.460> bit<00:04:24.259> flower<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:28.229> i<00:04:28.439> put<00:04:28.770> here<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
so good a bit flower so i put here a

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.719 
so good a bit flower so i put here a
little<00:04:29.189> bit<00:04:29.340> slower<00:04:30.439> and<00:04:31.439> now<00:04:32.129> I'll<00:04:32.370> save<00:04:32.699> my

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
little bit slower and now I'll save my

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:44.910 
little bit slower and now I'll save my
dog

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.370 

so<00:04:45.920> we<00:04:46.100> can<00:04:46.310> make<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.640> as<00:04:46.820> close<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.840> circuit

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
so we can make it as close the circuit

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.550 
so we can make it as close the circuit
that<00:04:48.920> I'm<00:04:49.190> not<00:04:49.370> good<00:04:49.640> in<00:04:49.670> that<00:04:50.260> but<00:04:51.260> you<00:04:51.410> know

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
that I'm not good in that but you know

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.350 
that I'm not good in that but you know
just<00:04:52.960> little<00:04:53.960> bit<00:04:54.260> practice<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.190> he<00:04:56.030> can<00:04:56.240> do

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
just little bit practice and he can do

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:10.830 
just little bit practice and he can do
it

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.570 

so<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.100> will<00:05:12.340> be<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.639> first<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:17.580> very

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
so this is will be my first and very

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.550 
so this is will be my first and very
important<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.330> read<00:05:19.510> your<00:05:19.690> event<00:05:20.080> at<00:05:20.290> least

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
important to read your event at least

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.879 
important to read your event at least
for<00:05:21.490> 10<00:05:21.699> minutes<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.440> though<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.470> should<00:05:23.740> be

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
for 10 minutes and though it should be

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.810 
for 10 minutes and though it should be
at<00:05:24.570> 500<00:05:25.570> or<00:05:25.750> 550<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:28.120> when<00:05:28.990> you<00:05:29.110> bake<00:05:29.380> the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
at 500 or 550 and when you bake the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.510 
at 500 or 550 and when you bake the
bread<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:31.870> have<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.229> put<00:05:32.650> your<00:05:32.830> baking<00:05:33.310> sheet

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.920 
bread you have to put your baking sheet
as<00:05:34.320> close<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:35.470> can<00:05:35.740> to<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.120> fire<00:05:37.120> source<00:05:39.930> so

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
as close you can to the fire source so

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.920 
as close you can to the fire source so
i'll<00:05:41.290> make<00:05:41.590> an<00:05:41.710> example<00:05:42.130> out<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:43.090> my<00:05:43.419> door<00:05:43.660> I

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
i'll make an example out of my door I

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.050 
i'll make an example out of my door I
put<00:05:44.889> a<00:05:44.919> little<00:05:45.070> bit<00:05:45.370> flour<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:47.050> then<00:05:47.530> I<00:05:47.680> will

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
put a little bit flour and then I will

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.430 
put a little bit flour and then I will
you<00:05:49.060> don't<00:05:49.240> have<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.630> roll<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:50.370> dough<00:05:51.870> so<00:05:52.870> thin

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
you don't have to roll the dough so thin

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:02.950 
you don't have to roll the dough so thin
no<00:05:54.310> just<00:05:55.139> like<00:05:56.139> this

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.860 

that's<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:06.470> so<00:06:07.470> as<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:07.830> see<00:06:08.040> I<00:06:08.220> have<00:06:08.250> to<00:06:08.870> flat

that's it so as you see I have to flat

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.940 
that's it so as you see I have to flat
bread<00:06:10.350> here<00:06:10.680> and<00:06:11.060> now<00:06:12.060> time<00:06:12.660> to<00:06:12.960> bake<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.140> so
