over<00:00:58.920> time<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.340> finish<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> wear

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
over time that finish is going to wear

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.639 
over time that finish is going to wear
away<00:01:00.210> until<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> wood<00:01:01.230> surface

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
away until you get to the wood surface

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470 
away until you get to the wood surface
itself<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.730> surface<00:01:03.149> comes<00:01:03.359> in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
itself and as that surface comes in

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
itself and as that surface comes in
contact<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:04.080> moisture<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.559> water<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
contact with moisture in water so it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.399 
contact with moisture in water so it
starts<00:01:05.820> where<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.390> fade<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.840> eventually

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
starts where and fade and eventually

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
starts where and fade and eventually
it's<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> swell<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.250> crack<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:08.880> maybe

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it's going to swell and crack or maybe

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's going to swell and crack or maybe
even<00:01:09.150> splinter<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.439> utility<00:01:10.950> purposes

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
even splinter so for utility purposes

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
even splinter so for utility purposes

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
quite nice and I do like the fact that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.149 
quite nice and I do like the fact that
it's<00:01:46.200> rounded<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.740> not<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> get

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's rounded so you're not going to get

it's rounded so you're not going to get

I wish that the texture was a little bit
better<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.820> supposed<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.689> has<00:01:54.810> a

better it's supposed to it has a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600 
better it's supposed to it has a

it<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.030> wish<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.479> put<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:57.780> sort<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it I wish they put some sort of

it I wish they put some sort of
stippling<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
stippling on it so that you get more of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.359 
stippling on it so that you get more of
a<00:01:59.670> grip<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:00.930> okay<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.070> end<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.310> the

thick and with this kind of Steel you'll

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.420 
thick and with this kind of Steel you'll
notice<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.959> pretty<00:02:46.170> rigid<00:02:46.440> trying<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
notice here it's pretty rigid trying to

that much and that's a good thing with

cheaper knives where the blade flexes a
little<00:02:52.709> bit<00:02:52.829> more<00:02:53.130> you'll<00:02:53.370> notice<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.730> when

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
little bit more you'll notice that when

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280 
little bit more you'll notice that when
you're<00:02:53.970> cutting<00:02:54.209> especially<00:02:54.750> say<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.170> you're

vibrations will travel to the handle and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.720 
vibrations will travel to the handle and
you'll<00:03:01.500> start<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.799> lose<00:03:01.950> control<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.519> you

you'll start to lose control and you
ever<00:03:02.849> be<00:03:03.090> cutting<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.599> you'll<00:03:03.750> hit<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
ever be cutting and then you'll hit the

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.610 
ever be cutting and then you'll hit the
bone<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.829> slip<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.400> side

thanks<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.389> curve<00:03:33.690> when<00:03:34.530> you're<00:03:34.680> doing<00:03:34.920> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
thanks to this curve when you're doing a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.330 
thanks to this curve when you're doing a
long<00:03:35.579> cut<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.030> get<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.299> full<00:03:36.660> use<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
long cut you get the full use of the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.670 
long cut you get the full use of the
cutting<00:03:38.670> surface<00:03:38.850> because<00:03:39.569> of<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.870> curve<00:03:40.139> so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
cutting surface because of this curve so

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.319 
cutting surface because of this curve so
you<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.859> cut<00:03:41.069> from<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> middle<00:03:41.639> all<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:42.239> way

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
you can cut from the middle all the way

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:42.890 
you can cut from the middle all the way
to<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.600> end

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
to the end

some<00:03:43.319> blade<00:03:43.530> shapes<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.920> only<00:03:44.040> use<00:03:44.280> say<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
some blade shapes you only use say the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.640 
some blade shapes you only use say the
first<00:03:45.450> third<00:03:45.690> right<00:03:45.930> here<00:03:46.200> when<00:03:46.350> you're<00:03:46.470> doing

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
first third right here when you're doing

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.190 
first third right here when you're doing
some<00:03:46.829> cutting<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.850> thanks<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.359> this<00:03:48.480> curve<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
some cutting but thanks to this curve I

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.349 
some cutting but thanks to this curve I
get<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.799> make<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.069> nice<00:03:50.280> smooth<00:03:50.670> curve<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
get to make it a nice smooth curve and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.490 
get to make it a nice smooth curve and
this<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.540> work<00:03:51.780> when<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:51.989> was<00:03:52.230> cutting<00:03:52.470> through

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
this is work when I was cutting through

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.440 
this is work when I was cutting through
vegetables<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.609> different<00:03:53.910> types<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.299> meat

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
vegetables and different types of meat

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.770 
vegetables and different types of meat
like<00:03:54.810> beef<00:03:54.870> or<00:03:55.380> fish<00:03:55.410> when<00:03:55.889> I<00:03:55.920> was<00:03:56.130> at<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> camp

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
like beef or fish when I was at the camp

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.930 
like beef or fish when I was at the camp
also<00:03:57.780> it's<00:03:58.349> been<00:03:58.620> rigid<00:03:58.980> enough<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.549> I've

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
also it's been rigid enough so that I've

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.759 
also it's been rigid enough so that I've
been<00:04:00.090> able<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.359> cut<00:04:00.660> through<00:04:00.810> some<00:04:01.019> fairly

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
been able to cut through some fairly

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.379 
been able to cut through some fairly
thick<00:04:02.040> branches<00:04:02.370> about<00:04:02.609> as<00:04:03.000> thick<00:04:03.239> as<00:04:03.359> my

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
thick branches about as thick as my

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.960 
thick branches about as thick as my
thumb<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.079> no<00:04:04.560> problems<00:04:04.889> with<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.040> hollow

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
thumb so no problems with that hollow

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.629 
thumb so no problems with that hollow
ground<00:04:06.650> haven't<00:04:07.650> had<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.799> sharpen<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.190> yet

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
ground haven't had to sharpen it yet

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.490 
ground haven't had to sharpen it yet
despite<00:04:09.239> all<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.540> times<00:04:09.720> I've<00:04:09.930> been<00:04:09.959> using<00:04:10.260> it

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
despite all the times I've been using it

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.890 
despite all the times I've been using it
so<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:11.160> retains<00:04:11.430> his<00:04:11.609> edge<00:04:11.760> pretty<00:04:12.030> well<00:04:12.150> I've

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
so it retains his edge pretty well I've

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.970 
so it retains his edge pretty well I've
talked<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.200> other<00:04:13.349> friends<00:04:13.530> who<00:04:13.709> have<00:04:13.859> this

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
talked to other friends who have this

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
talked to other friends who have this
knife<00:04:14.160> as<00:04:14.310> well<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.549> they<00:04:14.609> say<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.880> pretty

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
knife as well and they say it's pretty

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.759 
knife as well and they say it's pretty
easy<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.359> sharpen<00:04:15.810> thanks<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> hollow

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
easy to sharpen thanks to the hollow

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.349 
easy to sharpen thanks to the hollow

you<00:04:19.139> definitely<00:04:19.500> can<00:04:19.650> use<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.979> for

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
you definitely can use this for

you definitely can use this for
technical<00:04:20.459> purposes<00:04:20.729> I<00:04:21.090> mean<00:04:21.239> when<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.419> look

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
technical purposes I mean when you look

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.050 
technical purposes I mean when you look
at<00:04:21.719> it's<00:04:21.870> pretty<00:04:22.019> wicked<00:04:22.289> blade<00:04:22.620> with<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.219> very

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
sharp tip but for utility purposes I

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.659 
sharp tip but for utility purposes I
think<00:04:26.699> it's<00:04:26.849> excellent<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.629> well<00:04:27.870> made<00:04:28.669> what

else can I say about this thing

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.129 
else can I say about this thing
oh<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.740> weight<00:04:32.180> that's<00:04:33.180> something<00:04:33.990> that's

oh the weight that's something that's

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.860 
oh the weight that's something that's
incredibly<00:04:34.879> surprising<00:04:35.879> is<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.389> weight<00:04:36.599> it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
incredibly surprising is the weight it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.969 
incredibly surprising is the weight it
is<00:04:37.370> 2.6<00:04:38.370> ounces<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.289> for<00:04:40.289> something<00:04:40.590> with<00:04:40.770> a

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
loop right here so there's no quick

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.909 
loop right here so there's no quick
attachment<00:05:31.319> you're<00:05:31.409> gonna<00:05:31.529> have<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.770> loop

there's no bottom attachment here so you

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.050
