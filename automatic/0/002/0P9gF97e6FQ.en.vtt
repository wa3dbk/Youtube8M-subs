 welcome and dear the viewers of 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.870
 androidworld.it today Friday 11 July 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.269
 2014 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 and these are the usual two minutes you go 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.580
 well but who i want to tease 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.580
 in fact they are never 2 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.270
 welcome friends from androidworld.it e 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.380
 welcome also to google because today there is 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.230
 I have it with you 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.000
 let's start with android wear i am maybe 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.039
 one of those who believed in the most in 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.960
 these watches with android 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.059
 the first models and honestly I do not 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.890
 want lg I do not want samsung 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.129
 they are not perhaps the maximum of 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.570
 beauty are still good 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.129
 in short, good previews of what 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.260
 could be the future of android 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.239
 were what sincerely leaves me 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.050
 little perplexed dear google but not you 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.329
 to take 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.280
 and the fact that everything is entirely in 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.570
 your hand wants to say so far android has 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.340
 had its strength also in the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.560
 personalization that so many manufacturers 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.630
 they knew how to make these 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.579
 devices will all be given to you 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.950
 updated by you and cannot be 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:10.009
 custom are you really really 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.110
 really really really sure you can 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.399
 let it be let's come to android tv 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.649
 another of those things that 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.670
 personally I was really waiting 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.510
 long since 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.549
 good concept good good concept 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.440
 the interface also good performance 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.200
 of what the device is anyway 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.870
 for developers you submitted but 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.970
 you couldn't get it to have on the market 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.880
 I want something ready right now 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.890
 google tv saying dates back to years ago 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 technology that is inside this box not 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.780
 it is certainly something futuristic and therefore 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.630
 because we still have to wait for so many e 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.040
 many other android months I am one 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.470
 of those who like looks I'll be 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.770
 sincerely I also like these 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.260
 circle and triangle square that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.270
 probably nobody likes me 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.460
 also like the fact that you finally have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.080
 wanted to release a preview of yours 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.159
 operating system what so far not 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.409
 we never would have done 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.360
 the thing that leaves me a bit perplexed of 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.759
 this preview is the fact that it changes 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.280
 both aesthetics but not announced 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.170
 no real killer features nothing 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 really new certainly under the hood 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.460
 there is so much I invite you 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.890
 analyze all ours 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.810
 insights on the subject but maybe missing 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.720
 that something extra that I would be 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.850
 waited by android but i'm pretty sure 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.280
 that will arrive in the autumn and finally 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.560
 we come from android car this too was 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.090
 it was one of the somewhat announced changes 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.620
 to be honest but he did me 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.450
 pleasure to see that it was then 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.370
 confirmed by the facts I know it's a bit 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.740
 early to talk soca a little early 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.480
 to judge the thing that really me 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.760
 puzzled by this you will go the car 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.100
 and that currently works with only one 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.110
 telephone via wired connection 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.420
 but I say that if there were more 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.130
 phones and if maybe we wanted to go 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 in a friend's car and both 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.810
 we wanted to share the data of our 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.430
 smartphone with the on-board system and if 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.710
 for example there was no one 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.430
 smartphone what would remain of this 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.430
 android car
