00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
don't get a lot of pressure though this

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.359 
don't get a lot of pressure though this
is<00:01:45.570> better<00:01:45.810> than<00:01:45.930> nothing

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.740 

but<00:01:50.939> yeah<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.509> basically<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:53.090> now<00:01:54.090> 190

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
but yeah that's basically it now 190

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
but yeah that's basically it now 190
well<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.679> did<00:01:55.859> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
well I did have a little bit of a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.149 
well I did have a little bit of a
catastrophe<00:01:56.810> no<00:01:57.810> long<00:01:58.020> ago<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> light<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
catastrophe no long ago the light that

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.490 
catastrophe no long ago the light that
came<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> system<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.869> broke<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
came with the system it broke the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.959 
came with the system it broke the
ballasts<00:02:01.770> broke<00:02:02.039> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.729> can't<00:02:02.939> really

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
ballasts broke and then you can't really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.029 
ballasts broke and then you can't really
amend<00:02:03.299> them<00:02:03.450> they're<00:02:03.810> sealed<00:02:04.319> in<00:02:04.469> these<00:02:04.590> units

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
amend them they're sealed in these units

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.550 
amend them they're sealed in these units
so<00:02:05.819> I<00:02:05.850> did<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.270> take<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.929> old<00:02:07.049> ballast<00:02:07.409> out

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
so I did this take the old ballast out

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.509 
so I did this take the old ballast out
and<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:09.179> Hudson<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.780> new<00:02:10.170> ta<00:02:10.830> tubes<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
and just Hudson to new ta tubes to the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.000 
and just Hudson to new ta tubes to the
size<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> original<00:02:12.330> housing<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.920> then

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
size of the original housing and then

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.570 
size of the original housing and then
swim<00:02:14.280> off<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.549> ballast<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.950> saved<00:02:17.220> me<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> lot<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
swim off to ballast it saved me a lot of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.830 
swim off to ballast it saved me a lot of
money<00:02:17.700> because<00:02:17.940> add<00:02:18.269> these<00:02:18.480> two<00:02:20.360> Bayou<00:02:21.360> units

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
money because add these two Bayou units

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.839 
money because add these two Bayou units
about<00:02:22.080> hundred<00:02:22.380> twenty<00:02:23.040> pound<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:23.579> South

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
about hundred twenty pound I think South

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.620 
about hundred twenty pound I think South
