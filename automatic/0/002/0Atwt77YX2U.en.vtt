00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.629
 let's make a bear and see if you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.980
 we put a bow we will have the bear 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.560
 well then let's do first what 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.560
 I feel and then the bond we start using 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.720
 brown brown fondant more clarito and 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.930
 black the black will be for the eyes and the 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.610
 snout well with the dark we do 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 a cylinder that we divide into five 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.710
 parts the last one is a bigger bowl 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.310
 with a part and a half we are going to do the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 head we knead between both hands to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.239
 avoid wrinkles in the fondant 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.239
 and so we make a little ball 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.250
 now we cut the other two parts and 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.220
 stockings we leave one whole for arms and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.290
 legs and with the other two 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.660
 let's make the body and the ears 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.090
 we separated a little for the ears and with 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.090
 the rest we make a kind of tear 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.700
 for the body now let's do the 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 legs that are like two balls 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.380
 small, slightly elongated 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.210
 now with our aesthetic but let's go 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.720
 You can use a toothpick so you can see 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.140
 some little lines on the feet as if they were 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.140
 the fingers 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.310
 with the piece that remains we make a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.830
 We divide the cylinder in half and 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.570
 we have to do both arms alone 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.430
 we have to put a little thinner a 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.680
 extreme and a little fatter the other than 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.490
 will go where the hand that we will do 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.490
 then the little fingers 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.230
 as our bear imitates a teddy 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.790
 stuffed animal with the tip of a toothpick 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.280
 our case of the here we do 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.620
 as well as if they were the stitching we do 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.850
 that in the gut we do it in the arm and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.850
 we will also do it in the head 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.880
 as well 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.310
 well we also make the other arm that 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.530
 also after recording the video I give myself 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.909
 account we see so little fingers 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.530
 I realize that I forgot to put the 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.560
 stitching to this one but good if it does not pass 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.560
 nothing 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.890
 we put it aside all this we're going 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.300
 sticking with a little cmc diluted with 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.590
 a little diluted fondant 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.120
 well then we take the ball of the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.240
 head we see also the stitching 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.790
 and we are going to hit him the little one that is 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.580
 as a color fondant rounds 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.350
 You see clearly and now with this one here 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.000
 let's make a small slit and the 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.500
 mouth we 're going to make it round 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.500
 because it is much easier and they are better 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 we also do with the here is the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.910
 basins of the eyes we make the basins 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.530
 so that the eyes as I have already told you 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.530
 other times we do not get stuck 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.420
 I'm going to support my little head so that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.040
 you see better I put him in a piece of 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.930
 fondant good now I do the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.510
 ears that are not more than two balls 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.880
 round with a slit in the center 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.880
 and I stick them to the sides of the head 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.239
 to put the head in the trunk now 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.910
 what I'm going to use is a toothpick with a 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.430
 stick or a hole you see me sticking out 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.690
 so much now I remove the short stick 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.459
 the tip I do not like to me that the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.800
 sticks have a tip and I'll return 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.180
 to nail and until I already stand out very 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.000
 little that will help me hold the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.360
 head if you do not want to put a toothpick 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.400
 puts a raw spaghetti and serves you the same 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.920
 well then we just have to put the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 snout with black fondant and eyes 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.390
 that is a little to the tito the snout and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.370
 now we put the little eyes that is best 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.739
 that are small that big because they 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.100
 they are much better, well, we already have 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.959
 to the boy to the bear you see to do to the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.560
 We do not have more to do the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.410
 tie for that we stretch fondant 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.450
 rose a small cylinder and now a 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.229
 we take it to the center and the other 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.229
 extreme too 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.979
 we already have at the base of the loop 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.129
 we put a small strip of fondant 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.349
 lateral and even our bow we give you a 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.360
 bit of shape and we put it to the 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.509
 You see how fast and how easy it is for us 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.189
 are these little eyes bear and is therefore 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.199
