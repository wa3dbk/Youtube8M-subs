00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.580
 the double two wing loop is 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.390
 one of the classics and embellished 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
 every tree 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.070
 you only need two loops 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.269
 bender incorporating band as well as some 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.269
 pins for fixing 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.339
 First, take the shorter of the two 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.769
 grind bender 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.999
 Cross your ends and lead it 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.999
 then in the middle together 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.309
 make the loop in the middle 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.669
 and fix it with the help of one 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.669
 pin 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.660
 place the resulting loop 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.620
 in the middle of the bandage and fasten 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.180
 Give them a simple flower 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.620
 important here is that the knot open 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 the back of the loop lies 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.920
 please do not forget the needle too 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.920
 remove 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.960
 proceed with the second one 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.409
 loop band now exactly like with the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.409
 first 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.789
 cross the ends 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.929
 Lead the band in the middle 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:30.369
 they make it together and get it 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.369
 then with a pin 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.180
 put the second loop on the 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.040
 back of the first one and knot it 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.150
 this with the bandage again on the band 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.150
 back together 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.530
 now they have a nice elegant 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.350
 sweep out your christmas tree 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 something special makes them knot 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.220
 At the end, simply wrap the band around 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.000
 one of the first around the loop on the tree 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.000
 to fix 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.750
 but 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.810
 we wish you a nice one 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.810
 christmas party 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.590
 Why
