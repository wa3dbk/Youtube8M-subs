if this was a root six this would be a

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.479 
if this was a root six this would be a
major<00:00:40.809> six<00:00:41.290> interval<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.860> this<00:00:45.070> is<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.250> minor

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
major six interval but this is a minor

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
sixths and sometimes major sixth if you

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.060 
sixths and sometimes major sixth if you
take<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:07.700> notes<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.330> are<00:01:08.479> on<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.960> G<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.440> E

take the notes that are on the G and E
string<00:01:10.790> from<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:11.800> standard<00:01:12.800> C<00:01:13.100> bar<00:01:13.550> chord

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869

I'm<00:01:14.869> gonna<00:01:15.080> call<00:01:15.260> this<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.470> major<00:01:15.860> shape

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
I'm gonna call this the major shape

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.500 
I'm gonna call this the major shape
because<00:01:16.910> it's<00:01:17.600> got<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> major<00:01:18.050> 3rd<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
because it's got a major 3rd and the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.960 
because it's got a major 3rd and the
root<00:01:20.690> up<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.619> comes<00:01:24.619> from<00:01:24.970> ad

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
root up here and this comes from ad

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
root up here and this comes from ad
minor<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:27.500> next<00:01:27.830> one<00:01:28.450> we've<00:01:29.450> got<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.630> minor

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
minor the next one we've got a minor

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.880 
minor the next one we've got a minor
third<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.740> root<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.430> D<00:01:32.530> I'm<00:01:33.530> gonna<00:01:33.649> call

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
third and a root and D I'm gonna call

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.150 
third and a root and D I'm gonna call
this<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.220> minor<00:01:34.430> shape<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.770> if<00:01:37.640> we<00:01:37.820> do<00:01:37.940> sixths

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
this the minor shape so if we do sixths

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.359 
this the minor shape so if we do sixths
difficult<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.220> say<00:01:40.369> again<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:41.530> C<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:43.070> goes

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
difficult to say again in C it goes

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.109 
difficult to say again in C it goes
