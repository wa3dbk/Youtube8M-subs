hey guys Sonya here from tech respect

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.300 
hey guys Sonya here from tech respect
and<00:00:02.370> today<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:02.909> gonna<00:00:03.060> be<00:00:03.270> looking<00:00:03.510> at<00:00:03.899> the

the Samsung Galaxy s3 so let's get right

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:22.370 
the Samsung Galaxy s3 so let's get right
down<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.880> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.320 

all<00:00:23.380> right<00:00:23.529> so<00:00:23.830> I<00:00:23.859> have<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.490> regular<00:00:25.000> battery

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
all right so I have the regular battery

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.470 
all right so I have the regular battery
door<00:00:25.509> cover<00:00:25.779> here<00:00:26.289> for<00:00:26.770> comparison<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
door cover here for comparison to

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.890 
door cover here for comparison to
compare<00:00:28.869> with<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:30.390> metal<00:00:31.390> battery<00:00:31.750> door

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
compare with the metal battery door

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.450 
compare with the metal battery door
cover<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.470> as<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.829> can<00:00:33.040> see<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:35.530> not<00:00:35.980> sure<00:00:36.280> if

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
cover and as you can see I'm not sure if

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.369 
cover and as you can see I'm not sure if
you<00:00:36.580> can<00:00:36.850> see<00:00:37.120> but<00:00:37.330> this<00:00:37.600> is<00:00:37.840> quite<00:00:38.110> a<00:00:38.170> bit

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
you can see but this is quite a bit

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:47.369 
you can see but this is quite a bit
thicker<00:00:40.680> looking<00:00:41.680> from<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.430> back<00:00:42.839> and<00:00:44.070> top<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
thicker looking from the back and top it

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.479 
thicker looking from the back and top it
is<00:00:47.650> slightly<00:00:48.070> thicker<00:00:49.530> which<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.739> kind<00:00:51.400> of

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
is slightly thicker which is kind of

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.969 
is slightly thicker which is kind of
good<00:00:51.610> in<00:00:51.879> some<00:00:52.210> ways<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.780> kind<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.530> bad<00:00:53.710> in

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
good in some ways and kind of bad in

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.410 
good in some ways and kind of bad in
others<00:00:54.489> but<00:00:55.440> let's<00:00:56.440> just<00:00:56.739> slip<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:57.879> right<00:00:58.210> on

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
others but let's just slip this right on

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.759 
others but let's just slip this right on
to<00:00:58.750> my<00:00:58.989> galaxy<00:00:59.589> s3<00:00:59.949> here<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.690> you'll<00:01:02.680> notice

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
to my galaxy s3 here and you'll notice

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.000 
to my galaxy s3 here and you'll notice
that<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:04.350> surrounding<00:01:05.350> white<00:01:05.650> actually

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
that the the surrounding white actually

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.730 
that the the surrounding white actually
does<00:01:06.640> match<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.960> white<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.200> galaxy

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
does match the the white of the galaxy

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.310 
does match the the white of the galaxy
s3<00:01:12.159> here<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.360> material<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.140> white

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
s3 here but the material the white

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.499 
s3 here but the material the white
plastic<00:01:17.560> does<00:01:18.100> feel<00:01:18.520> slightly<00:01:18.939> different

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
plastic does feel slightly different

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.630 
plastic does feel slightly different
from<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.790> regular<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:23.070> polycarbonate<00:01:24.130> back

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
from the regular the polycarbonate back

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.550 
from the regular the polycarbonate back
the<00:01:25.630> original<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.170> mean<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.750> should<00:01:29.020> be<00:01:29.290> on

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
the original I mean so that should be on

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.460 
the original I mean so that should be on
it<00:01:29.890> does<00:01:30.130> going<00:01:30.490> much<00:01:30.700> easier<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.840> as<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.320> can

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
it does going much easier and as you can

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.950 
it does going much easier and as you can
see<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.890> thickness<00:01:33.280> actually<00:01:34.090> protects<00:01:34.720> the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
see that thickness actually protects the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.230 
see that thickness actually protects the
camera<00:01:35.500> now<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:35.890> camera<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.340> inside<00:01:36.790> not

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
camera now the camera is inside not

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.220 
camera now the camera is inside not
there's<00:01:38.140> no<00:01:38.340> hump<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.659> flash<00:01:40.900> and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
there's no hump there and the flash and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.620 
there's no hump there and the flash and
the<00:01:41.440> speaker<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.830> also<00:01:42.430> protected<00:01:43.000> which<00:01:43.510> is

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
the speaker is also protected which is

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.440 
the speaker is also protected which is
really<00:01:43.900> nice<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:45.460> thing<00:01:45.610> I'd<00:01:45.730> like<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.030> add<00:01:46.150> is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
really nice one thing I'd like to add is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.300 
really nice one thing I'd like to add is
that<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.230> does<00:01:47.920> make<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.850> foam<00:01:49.090> feel<00:01:50.310> quite

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
that this does make the foam feel quite

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.960 
that this does make the foam feel quite
a<00:01:51.340> bit<00:01:51.520> heavier<00:01:51.750> which<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.960> good<00:01:53.760> because<00:01:54.760> it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
a bit heavier which is good because it

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.230 
a bit heavier which is good because it
does<00:01:55.330> feel<00:01:55.570> more<00:01:55.600> solid<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.400> hand<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.940> I

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
does feel more solid in the hand and I

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.600 
does feel more solid in the hand and I
really<00:01:58.540> like<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.280> weight<00:02:00.460> is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
really like that and the weight is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.840 
really like that and the weight is
evenly<00:02:01.030> balanced<00:02:01.750> or<00:02:02.220> ultra<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> phone<00:02:03.610> so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
evenly balanced or ultra the phone so

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
evenly balanced or ultra the phone so
there's<00:02:04.060> no<00:02:04.270> heavier<00:02:04.810> part<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.680> for<00:02:06.340> cheap

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
there's no heavier part and for cheap

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.490 
there's no heavier part and for cheap
well<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:08.920> not<00:02:09.190> cheap<00:02:09.640> per<00:02:10.209> se<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.720> got<00:02:11.349> this

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
well it's not cheap per se I got this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.940 
well it's not cheap per se I got this
for<00:02:11.739> around<00:02:11.830> $11<00:02:12.790> which<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.680> right<00:02:14.680> about

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
for around $11 which is right about

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.220 
for around $11 which is right about
where<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.640> get<00:02:15.909> a<00:02:15.940> replacement<00:02:16.360> right

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
where you can get a replacement right

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.270 
where you can get a replacement right
about<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.530> amount<00:02:17.739> where<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.129> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
about the amount where you get the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.990 
about the amount where you get the
placement<00:02:18.849> battery<00:02:19.299> cover<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.440> original<00:02:21.000> but

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
placement battery cover the original but

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.930 
placement battery cover the original but
I<00:02:22.739> think<00:02:23.739> it's<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.980> great<00:02:24.190> addition<00:02:24.489> if<00:02:24.819> you

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
I think it's a great addition if you

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.570 
I think it's a great addition if you
like<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.330> brushed<00:02:25.659> aluminum

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
like the brushed aluminum

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.670 
like the brushed aluminum
look<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.830> metal<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:30.810> does<00:02:31.170> work<00:02:31.440> really

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
look and it is metal it does work really

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.440 
look and it is metal it does work really
well<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:33.240> for<00:02:33.900> data<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:35.450> interruptions

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
well and as for data and interruptions

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.350 
well and as for data and interruptions
does<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.080> actually<00:02:37.230> interrupt<00:02:37.980> with<00:02:41.360> data

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
does it actually interrupt with data

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.660 
does it actually interrupt with data
connectivity<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.200> let<00:02:44.190> me<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.640> over

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
connectivity but let me just go over

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.230 
connectivity but let me just go over
here<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.570> results<00:02:46.940> zoom<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.300> bit<00:02:50.240> get

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
here to my results zoom in a bit get

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.420 
here to my results zoom in a bit get
that<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.630> focus<00:02:52.020> there<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.010> go
