00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.510
 the pain 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.470
 all I had to bring was 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.300
 actually the sticks 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.920
 marinates and we then have a set 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.200
 to travel 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.309
 prepare the guitar and sit with the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.480
 how this was done 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.400
 it for much harmony can see what i am 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.190
 use and what I always bring with me 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.530
 someone took luggage super handy because yes 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.250
 check in luggage can be lost is that 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.180

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.180
 pieces where I use it 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.330
 is it two straight and 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.369
 with the hybrid put you can then urge you there 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.380
 put on you quickly and you hit the snow 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.880
 you can put a thick cut under it or 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.880
 just a very high of very aggressive 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.910
 metal is also handy for something 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.700
 more ticks get your kick out by one 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.590
 to use trigger you really put minute 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.729
 I have and you ca n't all have one 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.960
 use two for 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.759
 and what I also love is 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.340
 play along with looks 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.660
 so that you walk you or whatever 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.210
 just turn it on and then you can 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.340
 media manager ate you bet out again 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:41.780
 yes, I actually want much more there 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:44.390
 join the one for the two that I do 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.259
 had with me and I got that twitter 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.530
 bars 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.570
 your tractors and then in a different setting 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.180
 also use the catering and the snert 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.180
 rings and I still have the roland spd-sx 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.180

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.560
 experimenting the studio with 10 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.399

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.710
 x and that is yes I can do much more there 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.600
 than I do now so that's for me 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.320
 that is also an own kind of discovery 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.750
 I really want to be crazy about that discovery 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.900
 I think I also have such an external or extra 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.070
