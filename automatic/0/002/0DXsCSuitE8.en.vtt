what's<00:00:00.539> happening<00:00:00.870> my<00:00:00.960> body<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.319> busy<00:00:01.709> here

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
what's happening my body is busy here

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.050 
what's happening my body is busy here
and<00:00:02.129> today<00:00:02.399> I'm<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.639> show<00:00:02.790> you<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.030> to

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.510 
and today I'm going to show you how to
set<00:00:03.360> up<00:00:03.449> your<00:00:03.570> dxtory<00:00:04.350> so<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.160> can<00:00:05.370> record

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
set up your dxtory so you can record

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.169 
set up your dxtory so you can record
game<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.710> it<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.309> good<00:00:08.519> quality<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.940> guess

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
game and it to be good quality I guess

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.180 
game and it to be good quality I guess
so<00:00:09.660> let's<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.500> started

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
so let's get started

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.610 
so let's get started
the<00:00:11.700> first<00:00:11.969> tab<00:00:12.450> target<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.230> don't<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the first tab target you don't have to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.079 
the first tab target you don't have to
worry<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.400> will<00:00:14.610> start<00:00:14.849> filling

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
worry about that this will start filling

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.599 
worry about that this will start filling
up<00:00:15.299> once<00:00:15.630> you're<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.139> DirectX<00:00:16.980> or<00:00:17.190> open

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
up once you're in a DirectX or open

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.590 
up once you're in a DirectX or open
shell<00:00:18.050> game<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.590> obviously<00:00:20.400> every<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.270> is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
shell game so obviously every game is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.230 
shell game so obviously every game is
either<00:00:21.810> OpenGL<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:22.529> DirectX<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.430> should<00:00:24.210> be

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
either OpenGL or DirectX so should be

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.950 
either OpenGL or DirectX so should be
fine<00:00:24.480> there<00:00:26.060> overlay<00:00:27.060> settings<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.840> have

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
fine there overlay settings I just have

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
fine there overlay settings I just have
it<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.140> top<00:00:28.470> left<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> wherever

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it in top left you can have it wherever

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.800 
it in top left you can have it wherever
you<00:00:30.119> want

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you want

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.659 
you want
I<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.410> having<00:00:31.679> top<00:00:31.890> left<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.550> out

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I just having top left because it's out

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.240 
I just having top left because it's out
of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of the way and I can see it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
of the way and I can see it
folder<00:00:35.969> options<00:00:36.329> now<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.840> record<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.260> two<00:00:37.440> hard

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
folder options now I record two two hard

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.569 
folder options now I record two two hard
drives<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.460> way<00:00:39.649> it's<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> raid

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
drives this way it's kind of like a raid

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.470 
drives this way it's kind of like a raid
array<00:00:42.079> but<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.680> without<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.789> being<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.180> raid

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
array but with without it being a raid

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.979 
array but with without it being a raid
array<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.059> two<00:00:48.210> hard<00:00:48.450> drives<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
array so you put two hard drives in and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.729 
array so you put two hard drives in and
it<00:00:49.140> will<00:00:49.289> record<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:50.329> apart<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.690> drive<00:00:52.350> one

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it will record are apart to drive one

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.400 
it will record are apart to drive one
and<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:53.190> apart<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> drive<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.230> not

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and an apart to drive two so it's not

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.770 
and an apart to drive two so it's not
constantly<00:00:55.949> writing<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.300> drive<00:00:57.570> its

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
constantly writing to one drive its

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.229 
constantly writing to one drive its
first<00:00:58.620> second<00:00:58.920> first<00:00:59.070> second<00:00:59.430> kind<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.059> thing

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
first second first second kind of thing

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.130 
first second first second kind of thing
so<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:01.399> it's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.699> lot<00:01:02.879> faster<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.570> but

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so I'm it's a lot faster that way but

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.109 
so I'm it's a lot faster that way but
also<00:01:04.379> these<00:01:04.739> drives<00:01:05.100> are<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.489> fast<00:01:05.760> drives

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
also these drives are pretty fast drives

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
also these drives are pretty fast drives
anyway<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.460> helps<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.890> not

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
anyway so that also helps I do not

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.880 
anyway so that also helps I do not
recommend<00:01:11.990> recording<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> hard<00:01:13.500> drive

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
recommend recording to the hard drive

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
recommend recording to the hard drive
that<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:14.549> playing<00:01:14.909> from<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.470> will

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that you're playing from because it will

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
that you're playing from because it will
try<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> access<00:01:17.610> data<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> game<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> then

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
try to access data for the game and then

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
try to access data for the game and then
it'll<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.439> trying<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> write<00:01:20.100> data<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> UM

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it'll be trying to write data for the UM

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.530 
it'll be trying to write data for the UM
for<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> video<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.280> yeah<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> bad<00:01:24.360> idea

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
for the video so yeah that's a bad idea

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.340 
for the video so yeah that's a bad idea
and<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> slows<00:01:25.320> everything<00:01:25.950> down<00:01:26.900> our<00:01:27.900> hotkeys

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and it slows everything down our hotkeys

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.609 
and it slows everything down our hotkeys
I<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.829> delete<00:01:29.159> cuz<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.110> don't

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
I use delete cuz it's there and I don't

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.190 
I use delete cuz it's there and I don't
use<00:01:31.770> delete<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.250> anything<00:01:32.400> else<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> use<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
use delete for anything else so use it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
use delete for anything else so use it
for<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.770> hotkey<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.579> use<00:01:35.759> again

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
for the hotkey you can use again

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.109 
for the hotkey you can use again
whatever<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.689> want<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.710> use

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
whatever you want but I only use

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
whatever you want but I only use
start/stop<00:01:39.119> movie<00:01:39.659> capture<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.890> use

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
start/stop movie capture so I don't use

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.399 
start/stop movie capture so I don't use

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
up our movie I use the dxtory video

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
up our movie I use the dxtory video
codec<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.219> high<00:01:59.939> quality<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.990> don't

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
codec with the high quality and I don't

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
codec with the high quality and I don't
compress<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.180> medium

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
compress it in here you can use medium

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.300 
compress it in here you can use medium
quality<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.590> normal<00:02:04.950> hard<00:02:05.100> drives

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
quality if you have normal hard drives

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.150 
quality if you have normal hard drives
but<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.259> faster<00:02:07.259> spinning

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
but if you have like faster spinning

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.650 
but if you have like faster spinning
hard<00:02:08.280> drive<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:08.879> use<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.450> high

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
hard drive and you can use the high

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.150 
hard drive and you can use the high
quality<00:02:10.080> ones

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
quality ones

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.340 
quality ones
now<00:02:12.180> medium<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.450> high<00:02:13.510> quality<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.170> don't

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
now medium and high quality you don't

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.810 
now medium and high quality you don't
really<00:02:14.620> see<00:02:14.800> too<00:02:15.010> much<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.490> difference

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
really see too much of a difference

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.730 
really see too much of a difference
there<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.540> wouldn't<00:02:17.020> really<00:02:17.170> worry<00:02:17.470> if<00:02:17.650> you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
there so I wouldn't really worry if you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.150 
there so I wouldn't really worry if you
have<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> use<00:02:18.250> medium<00:02:18.700> i<00:02:19.620> recording<00:02:20.620> 30fps

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
have to use medium i recording 30fps

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.260 
have to use medium i recording 30fps
just<00:02:21.940> because<00:02:22.330> 30fps<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.590> where<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:24.640> at<00:02:24.850> now

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
just because 30fps is where it's at now

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.410 
just because 30fps is where it's at now
and<00:02:25.690> they're<00:02:25.810> not<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.310> 30fps<00:02:27.310> are<00:02:27.880> YouTube

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and they're not really 30fps are YouTube

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.480 
and they're not really 30fps are YouTube
caps<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.080> 30fps<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.920> when<00:02:30.160> I'm<00:02:30.280> using

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
caps it to 30fps and when I'm using

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.840 
caps it to 30fps and when I'm using
dxtory<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.330> tend<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:31.780> record<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.580> then

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
dxtory I tend to just record and then

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.240 
dxtory I tend to just record and then
render<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:34.630> upload<00:02:35.110> kind<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.770> thing<00:02:35.920> so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
render and then upload kind of thing so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.140 
render and then upload kind of thing so
yeah<00:02:37.120> 30<00:02:37.330> FPS<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.930> fine<00:02:38.320> but<00:02:39.100> if<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.460> wanted<00:02:39.910> if

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
yeah 30 FPS is fine but if you wanted if

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.170 
yeah 30 FPS is fine but if you wanted if
you<00:02:40.840> wanted<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.650> slow<00:02:42.160> things<00:02:42.400> down<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.760> could

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
you wanted to slow things down you could

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.080 
you wanted to slow things down you could
call<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.230> 60<00:02:44.830> or<00:02:44.950> 120<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.240> for<00:02:46.450> 30<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:48.070> do

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
call it 60 or 120 but I just for 30 I do

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.850 
call it 60 or 120 but I just for 30 I do
output<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.720> file<00:02:49.990> output<00:02:50.500> because<00:02:50.710> we

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
output to file output because we

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.070 
output to file output because we
obviously<00:02:51.010> want<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.640> file<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.300> file

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
obviously want to file and that file

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.690 
obviously want to file and that file
will<00:02:53.350> be<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.500> raw<00:02:53.830> cat<00:02:54.160> file<00:02:56.160> there's<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.340> rule

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
will be a raw cat file there's a rule

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.480 
will be a raw cat file there's a rule
cap<00:02:57.940> converter<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.560> re<00:03:00.070> render

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
cap converter that you just re render

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.120 
cap converter that you just re render
the<00:03:00.640> footage<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.360> recorded<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.800> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
the footage that you recorded and it's a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.790 
the footage that you recorded and it's a
lot<00:03:03.430> easier<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:04.120> way<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:05.110> once<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.500> record

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
lot easier that way so once you record

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.640 
lot easier that way so once you record
it<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:06.370> open<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.300> then<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.470> will

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
it you just open this and then you will

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.710 
it you just open this and then you will
have<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> recording<00:03:09.580> here<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.180> click<00:03:10.330> build

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
have a recording here you click build

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.050 
have a recording here you click build
and<00:03:11.080> then<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.650> builds<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.640> then<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.910> can

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and then it builds that and then you can

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.850 
and then it builds that and then you can
drag<00:03:13.930> into<00:03:14.290> your<00:03:14.590> editing<00:03:14.950> program

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
drag into your editing program

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.370 
drag into your editing program
these<00:03:17.860> ones<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.430> don't<00:03:18.640> have<00:03:18.970> ticked<00:03:19.390> because<00:03:19.810> I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
these ones I don't have ticked because I

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.820 
these ones I don't have ticked because I
don't<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.690> scaling<00:03:22.690> now<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.080> is<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.320> really

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
don't and scaling now this is a really

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.630 
don't and scaling now this is a really
cool<00:03:24.040> thing<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:25.020> play<00:03:26.020> in<00:03:26.080> 1080p<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:26.980> record<00:03:27.490> in

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
cool thing I play in 1080p but record in

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.950 
cool thing I play in 1080p but record in
720p<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.800> while<00:03:29.800> I'm<00:03:30.010> playing<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.430> 1080p<00:03:30.960> it

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
720p so while I'm playing in 1080p it

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.830 
720p so while I'm playing in 1080p it
down<00:03:32.560> scales<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.520> video<00:03:33.790> while<00:03:34.330> it's

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
down scales the video while it's

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.030 
down scales the video while it's
recording<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.740> 720p<00:03:36.370> which<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:37.000> awesome<00:03:37.770> so<00:03:38.770> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
recording to 720p which is awesome so I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.230 
recording to 720p which is awesome so I
record<00:03:39.490> in<00:03:39.580> 720p

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
record in 720p

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.400 
record in 720p
again<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.410> can<00:03:41.560> record<00:03:41.800> in<00:03:41.950> 1080<00:03:42.340> by<00:03:43.110> yeah<00:03:44.110> you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
again you can record in 1080 by yeah you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.610 
again you can record in 1080 by yeah you
don't<00:03:44.500> really<00:03:44.650> need<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.630> now<00:03:46.660> audio<00:03:47.020> this<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.410> a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
don't really need to now audio this is a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.440 
don't really need to now audio this is a
really<00:03:48.280> great<00:03:48.490> thing<00:03:48.670> about<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:49.060> program

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
really great thing about this program

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.050 
really great thing about this program
you<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.780> have<00:03:49.960> multiple<00:03:50.560> audio<00:03:51.310> inputs<00:03:51.850> and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
you can have multiple audio inputs and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.940 
you can have multiple audio inputs and
outputs<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:54.040> three<00:03:54.810> two<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:56.170> no<00:03:56.710> two
