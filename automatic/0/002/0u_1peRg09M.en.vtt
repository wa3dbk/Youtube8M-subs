00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.650 
think it's pretty cool um he was
supporting<00:04:49.460> about<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.610> chest<00:04:49.910> hair<00:04:50.150> here<00:04:50.390> so

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
supporting about a chest hair here so

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.700 
supporting about a chest hair here so
he's<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.870> little<00:04:51.500> bit<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.680> surly<00:04:52.070> beastly<00:04:52.640> man

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
he's a little bit of a surly beastly man

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.500 
he's a little bit of a surly beastly man
so<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.830> was<00:04:54.950> kind<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.160> interesting<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:56.360> could

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
so it was kind of interesting you could

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.120 
so it was kind of interesting you could
look<00:04:56.600> at<00:04:56.720> that<00:04:56.750> as<00:04:57.080> either<00:04:57.500> him<00:04:57.890> being

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
look at that as either him being

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.710 
look at that as either him being
infested<00:04:58.580> with<00:04:58.850> like<00:04:59.000> fleas<00:04:59.330> all<00:04:59.510> over<00:04:59.540> his

chest or its marts no chest hair so

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.810 
chest or its marts no chest hair so
that's<00:05:03.170> cool<00:05:03.380> his<00:05:04.190> muscles<00:05:04.490> are<00:05:04.520> pretty<00:05:04.730> well

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
that's cool his muscles are pretty well

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.230 
that's cool his muscles are pretty well
defined<00:05:04.910> I<00:05:05.510> think<00:05:06.230> he's<00:05:06.350> got<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.890> know<00:05:07.250> good

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
defined I think he's got you know good

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.200 
defined I think he's got you know good
good<00:05:08.810> mold<00:05:09.110> on<00:05:09.320> his<00:05:09.500> muscles<00:05:10.160> not<00:05:10.520> too<00:05:10.880> much<00:05:11.120> of

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
good mold on his muscles not too much of

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.640 
good mold on his muscles not too much of
the<00:05:11.270> complex<00:05:11.480> figure<00:05:12.110> something<00:05:12.440> she<00:05:12.530> when

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
the complex figure something she when

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.980 
the complex figure something she when
she<00:05:12.740> intricacy<00:05:13.550> he<00:05:14.420> does<00:05:14.540> have<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.780> white

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
she intricacy he does have the white

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.480 
she intricacy he does have the white
streaks<00:05:15.290> in<00:05:15.470> his<00:05:15.560> hair<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.070> I<00:05:16.130> do<00:05:16.190> think<00:05:16.430> that's

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
streaks in his hair so I do think that's

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.590 
streaks in his hair so I do think that's
pretty<00:05:16.730> well<00:05:16.910> done<00:05:17.120> he's<00:05:17.240> got<00:05:17.360> black<00:05:17.570> hair

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
pretty well done he's got black hair

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.570 
pretty well done he's got black hair
white<00:05:17.990> streaks

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580
