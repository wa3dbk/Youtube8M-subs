00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
either going with right down 25 degree

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
either going with right down 25 degree
angle<00:01:21.240> whatever<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> that

clear pipe coming out the side of the
tank<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> very<00:01:31.799> top<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> white

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
tank this is the very top to white

tank this is the very top to white
section<00:01:34.310> it's<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> white<00:01:35.700> cube<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
section it's the white cube then that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.440 
section it's the white cube then that
comes<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.520> tank

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.100 

and<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.770> year<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:46.020> you
