does<00:01:19.820> anything<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:24.140> actually<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.680> know<00:01:24.800> so

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
does anything it's actually you know so

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.140 
does anything it's actually you know so
i<00:01:25.340> guess<00:01:26.060> my<00:01:26.240> font<00:01:26.600> doesn't<00:01:26.960> like<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.350> l<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.970> it

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
i guess my font doesn't like the l so it

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.200 
i guess my font doesn't like the l so it
does<00:01:29.330> must<00:01:29.600> stay<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.960> salon<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:31.150> try<00:01:32.150> it

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
does must stay in the salon but try it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.740 
does must stay in the salon but try it
again<00:01:32.680> there<00:01:33.680> might<00:01:33.890> be<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.630> might<00:01:35.630> actually

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
again there might be a might actually

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.520 
again there might be a might actually
work<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.200> time<00:01:36.470> but<00:01:36.770> no<00:01:37.040> guarantees<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:39.320> does

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
work this time but no guarantees it does

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.690 
work this time but no guarantees it does
i<00:01:39.560> don't<00:01:39.860> think<00:01:40.009> that's<00:01:40.160> even<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.550> fix

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
i don't think that's even going to fix

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.350 
i don't think that's even going to fix
