gold production and the potential for it
to<00:00:55.920> peak<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.820> could<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.059> mean<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to peak what could this mean for the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
to peak what could this mean for the
price<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> metal<00:00:58.109> well<00:00:59.039> anytime<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.489> have

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
price of the metal well anytime you have

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.459 
price of the metal well anytime you have
a<00:00:59.670> supply<00:00:59.969> restriction<00:01:00.719> taking<00:01:01.050> place<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
a supply restriction taking place in the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.340 
a supply restriction taking place in the
capital<00:01:01.859> markets<00:01:02.280> prices<00:01:02.940> rise<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> think

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
capital markets prices rise so I think

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.620 
capital markets prices rise so I think
it's<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:05.010> positive<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.549> constructive

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
it's very very positive and constructive

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.969 
it's very very positive and constructive
because<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> world's<00:01:07.080> money<00:01:07.260> supply<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
because the world's money supply with

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
because the world's money supply with
quantitative<00:01:08.460> easing<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.630> these

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
quantitative easing and all these

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
quantitative easing and all these
different<00:01:09.930> countries<00:01:10.530> has<00:01:10.650> only<00:01:10.830> give<00:01:11.070> me<00:01:11.100> fat

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
