00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 two 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.900
 when you ask for telepizza you just want that 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.520
 llope telepizza the wait is over now 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.150
 we take you the new pizza three floors 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.950
 for 795 with antoine griezmann antoine 04 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 and the defeat against Real Madrid the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.310
 first part very even with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.450
 Many sample options for 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.620
 Advance a second game 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.410
 different I do not know how you have seen the 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.540
 party that I think we 've made a 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.520
 good first part 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 and then they put the goal before the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 rest and then in the second we have gone 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.810
 for all and then what is against is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.420
 they are very good 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.490
 maybe he has been key in the goal on the edge 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.780
 of the rest that has put in advantage to the 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.460
 real madrid then the divided bands 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.480
 have played more comfortable when the team 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.580
 above all he is doing well in the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.930
 first half if we were very comfortable 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.290
 us at the beginning and then the summer 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.230
 It is better to go into the break 0-0 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 that losing but well we gave everything 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.870
 they have been superior and so far 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.480
 think about the next game before a 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.040
 team so the slightest mistake is not 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.200
 pay they have not marked at the end 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 four goals must always be at 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 one hundred percent and will grant penalties for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.720
 have options against this kind of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.940
 teams if we knew that we had to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 make a great match 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.150
 in the collective and then on a personal level 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.900
 but good as I said 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.850
 superiors and now forget that match and 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.070
 rest I have six games left to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.510
 the end of the season must be done 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.080
 the last effort not to finish it well 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:53.480
 if now we will give everything in each match 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.520
 and get the point anywhere and 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.260
 Lalo everything to enter Europe 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 sergio cars or channels and finally 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.520
 feelings the defeat always hurts 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 but I do not know how I've seen the team does not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.360
 contributes well in the second and the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.010
 badri decision something superior I do not know what 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.910
 sensations remain of this match 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.880
 although it will not be after a 0 4 is very 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.590
 very painful no and well I think the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.390
 first part just like I had a 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.730
 tad more position but good I think 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.740
 I saw the comfortable team we were 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.540
 creating danger 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.010
 they always as above have they have 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.110
 very good players we have not had 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.950
 to put and put us ahead and I 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.530
 I think the game would have been 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 totally different it could not be and 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.400
 Finally, the potential they have 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.880
 up is great and good they have done 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.280
 four goals 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.740
 I already have the feeling at the end and after 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.780
 a 0-4 never for being good but that's 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.310
 that feeling that you have more or 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 less and the party and that in two 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.170
 sparkles escaped if hunger contrast 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.110
 of equipment usually happens that it seems that what 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.240
 you have already told you I think the key 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.400
 it would have been to get ahead 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.610
 we were comfortable defending and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.170
 well it would have cost a little more and 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.880
 Well, it came to you when you put them 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.400
 ahead at the end then to the counterattack they are 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.940
 very powerful and it was difficult that so 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.550
 meaning you personally good is more than 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.960
 the same is not for a 0-4 I think that 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.790
 nobody can feel good when it ends 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.140
 the match and well you have to look for 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.880
 forward and you have to win in shipping is the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.100
 next step there are not six games left 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.230
 came up the team is good since 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.090
 still with a considerable income to the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.980
 posts that do not give access to Europe the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.150
 team has that that position well 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.950
 consolidated but not trying 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.720
 step on the accelerator one last effort 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.830
 in these six days left for 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.710
 secure it 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.770
 yes yes the truth that the team I believe 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.960
 who has made a very good season 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.140
 and in addition he has had many parties very 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.760
 hard against very strong and good rivals 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.690
 I think I 've done a very long time 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.690
 good and finish the same
