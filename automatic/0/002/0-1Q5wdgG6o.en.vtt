00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.380
 I cut it in half as well as 2 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.369
 I donâ€™t know how many halves 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:58.329
 even the size of a small house will be 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.329
 interesting start it about 10 cm 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.270
 did so here's the part I welded on 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.160
 to hang 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.789
 the top burned squirrels here under the eight 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.799
 side here is such a corner means soot 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.459
 made bike lean 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:37.079

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.670
 fact God leaves it in order not to 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.849
 rolled over on a small with a slope 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 you can of course bend over the beans 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.599

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.510
 colored this cradle all doing here 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.620
 you can be done completely differently 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.870
 I have so it is more stupefied all sidushku 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.519
 I seldom raise and lower my soul like this 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.400
 she has her here I fell and well 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.900
 of course ugly now here under 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.410
 see the pedal here when it turns 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.609
 pedal yes that's left from a small 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.370
 clearance for legs so he let 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:27.209
 so as not to cling at first a little warmer 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.780
 brought up accustomed here 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.209
 the case is still a sitter here I blocked 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.549
 my grandfather here I have the keys often 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.459
 kept so here i did to sit 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.109
 to keep the cranberries stored and stored 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:52.590
 here's a mower style 55 to its so here 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:57.819
 I insert here and so quietly comes 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.849
 worth it here breathed out sticking nothing 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.250
 I drove everything is fine here mount I 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.819
 while on the shelves you need here soft 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.670
 some full do this also 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:15.069
 the figure can easily be removed 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:24.850
 I have attached at 2 but here is one corner 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:26.400
 yes I am quietly when unscrewing 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:34.510
 this corner is also 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:39.490
 quietly ancestor in humans like this 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.710
 here and do i corners like lu 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.260
 movable 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:53.440
 lectures eat when the slut was filmed 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:56.290
 more sweet 30 for 45 so here is the place for 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.860
 I have a pump calmly like this 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.160
 wrap here with a stick we connect it 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:10.960
 calmly vlazit all 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:16.060
 like it was just like you should have 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:20.500
 here you eat it means you produce it here 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.610
 This is done first key 17 yes 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.430
 I do not have a key for 17 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.720
 mites transition here so here I am 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.660
 unscrew now I quickly 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.330
 spins the income as I used to say 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:42.970
 it's not all 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.970
 there is this whole scheme like this water unscrewed 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.370
 just fell see bent because 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.830
 what is the central bolt here 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.439
 then I mean but it is rarely removed 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:06.199
 so here I am producing 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:11.469
 raise one seat because 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:18.830
 sidushka interfere here are your plans and slats 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:29.169
 so I almost took it off 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:29.169
 and so here is the shooting 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:56.120
 and here here here here here's a good pancake 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.720
 here is this bolt here it is bolted 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.070
 somehow was 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.070
 need to change here were the coach here and so 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:16.160
 calmly inserted this pipe 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:20.420
 on troubled bolts honed like that 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.830
 here it is inserted and all strengthening 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:27.770
 not the most difficult about not said difficult 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:32.960
 she put a man what a mess 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:36.470
 so I have enough to subscribe to my 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.860
 channel leave comments ask 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:42.400
 any questions to me 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.400
 I will try to answer all
