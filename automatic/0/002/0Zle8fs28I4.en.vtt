00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.899
 those and all of August it's draco 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.210
 so today for video two top 10 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.440
 so February 2, 2013 while it was a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.849
 big delay what I usually like 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.110
 well 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.790
 I should have done it to mid 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.230
 March and there we are at the end of the month 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.430
 we make it real good I was when 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 even do it what I tried each 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.630
 months to do so so ben I'm 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.699
 engaged I will do it but I still 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 seen as a great author and I do a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 big delay not functional is found 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.680
 still a lot knowing that bah that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 pass quickly so I apologize 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 and so I really try to do better 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 for the top I apologize again there we 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.640
 will start there are only cards 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
 Japanese for this cramped top with 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 drunk that I knew I was going there have 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 shaken legs in January 2013 there 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
 and the three were bash is swept 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 I want to say my part the news 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 cards so well we can say goodbye 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.710
 to the French and not that one because all 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.840
 the westerners eventually fired them 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 a young quarter time gasu assigns a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 year the Japanese completely dominates this 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.969
 100% top so we will start the 10th 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.229
 place with naked all iec this gift bluth 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.290
 Japanese factories so we want you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.960
 so note then for these pv then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.850
 that she gives to 170 since it's an ex 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 multiplied by 1.5 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.909
 seen that it's a legendary despite 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.340
 it's a bit logical visionex 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 it's x 25 and since it's a Japanese 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.009
 we also do x 25 what you want so 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.600
 when there are three points 25 th game I 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.909
 not going 55.5 a game I'm doing x 3 so 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.850
 one hundred and seventy times 3 it gives us 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.009
 500 this book here is 10th with his baby 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.680
 then 9th with some 10bp 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.450
 for the same reasons hartco of an ex 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920
 so when they are unpublished and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 generally it is by preference 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.820
 then the pokemon itself this 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.229
 pre-report of the map we are young I 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.399
 hardstyle do believe that despite the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.219
 match be very beautiful here up 9th 8th with 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.170
 six pv fire but god it's 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.000
 from there that I have three it's for me 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.820
 finally sounded out of the three who have to 510 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 p wc the most beautiful color series 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.380
 reap excuse me I think by by 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.470
 air of the courage of the father recalls ayex and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.500
 frankly she has a super 3d effect 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 beautiful frankly she ensures that's it 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.900
 then 7th cobalt family is so the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.980
 yes saw it there is 180 bp beats cost 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.360
 180 x 3 so that's 5 140 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.980
 so here is hop 7th 6th bira sinaï ex 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.770
 so cobalt equal but this is the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.410
 reference who plays so 5th is going to be 540 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:40.350
 and then we come to the top 5 so 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.959
 5th ouguiya iex with I know more 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.989
 how many low countries is 140 logically 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.940
 in 1491 180 x 3 is done is 140 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.230
 so here is his joy the preference one eye 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.170
 was 4th a new mpx 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.140
 so here's a peillex so at the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.870
 fourth place with 540 third bat 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.800
 still third in fact groudon iex 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.390
 with 540p so here is our moves 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.310
 in second place 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.320
 well it will change but in fact the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.580
 triolet the trion the trio will not change 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.220
 for the first three so after 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.690
 grognec his usual thirds 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.860
 artillery ex crowd art rest also 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.230
 second as usual then he he has 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.299
 seized no nonsense 680 since it is 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.890
 a lot arthaud crowd to do you have 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.280
 eyes I said to fairgrounds 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.209
 where 5 for the already has on people to 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.579
 points scored 5 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.610
 it's a Japanese x 25 and it's a 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.180
 art crowd so at x 2 and when there is 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.400
 a x 2 1 x 5 and other times five games 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.510
 there I was enough for the shot by four 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.410
 and that's 2680 pv now and 1st of 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.900
 top as usual so dracaufeu 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.660
 Chesnais who has promised since 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.340
 because she's done since 4/5 me who 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.130
 dominates almost half a year 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.380
 that it brings at least there so 160 bp at 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.290
 it's a Japanese x 1.25 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.250
 it's a chain nor brothers ayew 5 to a 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.900
 chain and when I speak it is yet 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.120
 nor hid himself and then predicted that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.919
 it's a shiny card an iphone la 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.430
 difference between a chagny card and a 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.019
 Oak 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.669
 a cat lice is the pokémon itself 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.320
 because there are janyk beagles are 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.299
 not very rare kind i was hosting the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.150
 secrets you chained aberrant level 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.770
 what is there already a map 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.660
 janis and x 2.5 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.919
 because the art and faith crowds and so 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.699
 so I left more raku each 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.759
 times viruses 5 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.460
 a Japanese x 1.25 and pollen 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:40.620
 himself genius this logic hood 5 which 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.210
 is authentic 4.25 and 160 x 4.5 it is 7 120 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.699
 yes that's a lot 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.130
 yes, that's the first time 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.340
 so we do for the recap of the trio so 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.860
 third group whose ex sees the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.580
 second part related and first hop 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.960
 here is charizard chain 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.990
 so here is a source they let themselves 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.340
 fall I ask it so has it on this we get 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.410
 let's see you later maybe 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.210
 for an opening or a video yet 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.039
 more important 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.870
 surely on my salary so here is so 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.289
 we leave each other and sweep everyone 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.289
 good week
