00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 We're talking about one more animal today. 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 wild programs and more really cool 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.130
 of the tiger usually when speaking of March 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.870
 goes since the first to train fifth 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 It's going to be you did not see the team there because 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.190
 It was where the time has had that he has 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.810
 in India has India in Russia has 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 several places where it is most 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.490
 easy to see is in India because it has already 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.730
 are well preserved it has several parks 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.859
 created to preserve the tiger 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.349
 and yet it is not so easy to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.780
 to meet people was one day is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.210
 morning in training in the park and a fact 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 interesting that there all the cases that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.670
 they enter the park have to take a guide 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 place and prove that everyone is already 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.059
 the hotels all the infrastructure that has 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.289
 around or is helping 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 generate employment for the population 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.760
 but it was cool that it suddenly arrived in a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.079
 lane in the middle of the park started 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 have a conditioning 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 nobody understands what's happening 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 I went to look I had a tiger sleeping in the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 middle of the road and was good to take away 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 photos of the kind that is all that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.250
 He stayed 40 minutes asleep and we 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.950
 waiting for him to get up before 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 he decided to walk and that enters the middle 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 of the bush but it was very exciting 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.700
 see a team closely I think today in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.310
 day there are only about 2,500 nature and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 while there are more than 20 thousand 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.659
 captivity in the world so it's a bug 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 who unfortunately is on the verge of 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.090
 extinction and with a privilege to be able to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.009
 I hope they will be preserved for our 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 children by law and also the streets there in the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.210
 the Japanese design already tense with this 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.720
 freedom dominated in the midst of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.149
 road we have two ounces a male 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.790
 dominant there an ounce that we see 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 regularly as you think you own the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 Let's just say so he's super 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.780
 Calm down , he's already sleeping in the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.969
 middle of the road and another one a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 born during the project was born of 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.659
 a mother who was already accustomed and he is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 super quiet with us but this does not 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.329
 is rule in wetland so we ounce 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.890
 an animal almost impossible to see 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.959
 This is a safari project so that the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.069
 can provide those moments 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.349
 for 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.359
 much more wonderful people week than 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.519
