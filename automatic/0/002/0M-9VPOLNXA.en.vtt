00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello to all this sex or gide and we get 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.970
 found today on day light for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.400
 another glitch where I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 how to duplicate objects so 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 objects that will allow you to have 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.730
 money the unlimited or mount your 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.480
 rank of survivors at most for that 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.970
 what you need 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.449
 you need the player's hideout and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 to have 999 times an object so no matter 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.460
 which 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 me what I advise you is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 to buy 1999 hook it costs 10 thousand 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.349
 maximum dollars 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.930
 so that's it if you said mindi $ 1000 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.020
 on you you buy 1999 hook you 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.540
 think again after when you have 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.629
 999 objects you go in the plant of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:49.160
 player you have on the object you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 press extra hero at the same time 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 grow heron at the same time that's it and at the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.219
 window that opens it goes away all 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.629
 you alone do not press anything 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.090
 exactly the same technique 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.980
 the previous video to duplicate a 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 weapon you go back to the hideout 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.210
 you have the menu that appears you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.299
 go on the object you want we are going 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.030
 say multiply for example explosive 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.640
 toxic I have only one jean 1999 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 I press triangle here that's it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.850
 especially works things do not work 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.009
 on the weapons of just on the objects 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.689
 for that with its base thanks to that one 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.290
 going to say you see for example I have that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.579
 a barras purse will do the hop trick 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.939
 I go to the hideout 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.909
 I am aiming for the stock market I press on triangle 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.119
 I get it back by pressing square gÃ©e 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.380
 999 purse 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.270
 it works for crates too 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.869
 humanitarian aid that allow us to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 your survival experience so 1999 which 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.090
 is humanity 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.860
 you go up oran 25 in one go so that's it 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.320
 that's it it's super convenient for 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.630
 have money to have your rank 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.979
 maximum from the beginning so that's it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 like that you are you have the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 best to row all and what to say of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.530
 more so that's perfect so I 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.840
 will keep you informed if the glitch has 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 been patched on the description of the video 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.230
 like that you will not have to look at a 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.970
 video for nothing you just have to read 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 the description you will know if the patches 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.489
 or not so here it was axis gide for 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.670
 for a glitch on dying leiter hi to 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.670
 all
