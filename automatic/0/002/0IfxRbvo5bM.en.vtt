00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 of the news that will arrive here for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.490
 people and this news happened in the series 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.529
 I'll show you the strange thing. 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 schwenck has undergone some modifications 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 color of his screen now a more screen 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.260
 dark more rock'n'roll nÃ© 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 we have two channels instead of one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.390

 reverb that was also added in the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.270
 circuit and so the switch dark suit 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 that cuts the high frequencies 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.899
 making the sound stay a little longer is a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.449
 subtle touch on the high frequencies I 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.420
 I would say it 's a bit like the technician 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 toni kant and he also has novelty 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
