00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:26.550
 i am girls today record the crazy tag 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 per button 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.759
 and I'm the questions here so let's go 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.730
 how much lipstick do you have in your 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.820
 collection 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.550
 today I have 56 lipsticks to my collection 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
 I just count on 53 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.180
 and I ended up undoing some 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 pastors who was accumulating much 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.329
 button 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.579
 and as we only have one mouth it is not worth 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.170
 It's worth having so much button like that. 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.410

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:14.400
 lives without goals and I stopped here 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.659

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 to raze 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.119
 What was the last button that you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.180

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.829
 I bought 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.430
 If this question is a lipstick you 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.650
 regretted having bought the lipstick that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.650
 I regretted having found 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.860
 this was the month of mac 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.200

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.819

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.870

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:13.730

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:16.820

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.480
 lipstick desire of the moment button that everyone 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:27.109

 I can live very well without lipstick 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.730
 the mother of a kiss for a person 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.030

 red and she really likes lipstick 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.989
 red and I think red is a 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:04.400
 color that suits her so much 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.109
