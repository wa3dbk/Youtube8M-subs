00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.510
 what worth that in terms of purchase 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.350
 rabobank has one 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.960
 well great 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.250

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.040
 world of difference 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.680
