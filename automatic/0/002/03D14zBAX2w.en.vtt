00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 vandalism or art here became this 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 question already answered these banksy 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.779
 has recognition and protection as a work of art 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 to get 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.380
 at the works of super the rocket is 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.670
 it's more difficult to protect with that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.240
 their artworks are easy 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.099
 remove 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.020
 that does not make them any less illegal 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.940
 but to the coveted booty of art 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.859
 robbers who use it to decorate their home 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.539
 that's why the two artists have to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.740
 regularly on their way to theirs 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.300
 to renew works of art 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.810
 We have the two on their tour 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 accompanied 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.370
 the result of the recent nighttime 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.960
 sepa used the rocket the third 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 Tor now has several hundred 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.870
 you agree rockets in hamburg 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.870
 distributed 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.400
 styrodur a hair foam of the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.760
 architects and craftsmen liked to use 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 becomes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.830
 for the two the perfect material one 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.180
 can work very small parts with it and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.180
 it is also weatherproof 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.640
 the rocket embodies for the boys 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.990
 core of street art rockets she was there 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.680
 insane picture somehow for 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.690
 pop culture so just so in the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 because she was not 70 years 60 years 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.799
 somehow everyone wanted to become astronaut 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.210
 that is just incredibly strong for us 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.880
 is symbol symbol for pop and from 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.440
 the freedom urge 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.119
 there is nowhere more space than in 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.979
 space especially in the hill and st 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.780
 Pauli is found in graffiti 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.759
 Stenzels to start the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.009
 different styles the goal of 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.979
 artist is always the same 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.660
 create space in public space, too 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.459
 when distributing art to strangers 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.440
 house walls is punishable 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.489
 the reaction is noticed by the audience 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.489
 different 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 So what are pleased that the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 the people that martin this very creative 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 and brave, I think that's fantastic 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.970
 but the rich owners 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.060
 we met a nice lady 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.940
 and made big worries about the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.129
 passers-by who could be hurt 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.799
 from the enemy rockets and they 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.659
 would then be for the damage for the 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.549
 health damages arise and 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.200
 That's why she took the weight off 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.079
 then hung up in her garage because she 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.069
 She did not like it very much and does not give it to you 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.079
 out again otherwise there was so far 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.989
 No problems, therefore, will be diligent 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.879
 further built as they are not fixed 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.319
 You have your workshop today 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.859
 buddies in the monkey house gallery 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.859
 come across 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.269
 When traveling, the rocket likes it 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.290
 equipment with and so hang the works 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:28.030
 Also in Berlin Vienna and Paris own 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.400
 there is also an exhibition and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.140
 the rockets arrive 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.159
 not just in cash 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.440
 art lovers but also at 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.180
 streetart hunters the works in 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.910
 Picking up the city and home 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.030
 take yes sometimes you go also tips 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.060
 Who did not say that visit 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.560
 We also like the people and 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.450
 actually already some to buy 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.180
 offered so often a whole so it is 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.319
 bizarre it's actually very much 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.569
 pity if one does what the 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.449
 public space and a lot of work purely 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.480
 so that then people out of ambition 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:07.099
 or out of self-interest or what the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.020
 things somehow 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.030
 no joke the guys get a tip 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.250
 get your rockets easily 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.049
 back has such a visit that she 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.380
 in action here with the camera 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.380
 arrested 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:47.160
 right out here replenishment is taken care of 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.360
 Here is just leaving a new copy 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.360
 the launcher
