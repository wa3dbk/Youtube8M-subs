00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:13.639
 ingrids week hello rostock first topic 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.910
 Guttenberg gives Seehofer a basket and 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.099
 does not come to csu-party day worried 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.750
 well, but the other side what 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.710
 brings what's the one if 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.179
 politician comes more or less rich 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.369
 but come and go immediately 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.679
 that's all in the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.290
 Politicians do not like that 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.980
 everyone is talking 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.240
 no why everyone wants but a 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.840
 to be authority 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.840
 Well, there is little sauce in the relationship 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.520
 it has to be a bit of a distance like that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.620
 always so she comes from the north 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.450
 That's practically in those trading year 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.910
 but the local left are okay 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.410
 next topic is a pianist 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.840
 a helene fischer considers for 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.570
 Relaxation worried in case of expulsion 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.000
 In addition I mean that is yes is one 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 hot topic is yes the system houses the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.350
 all now all the whole which is also the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420
 whole riot etc 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.780
 but the pliers go holly holy holy 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 right-wing radicals and everything were committed 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.350
 and why helene fischer is a woman 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:31.189
 blond hair has a following passage 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:33.049
 The wrong thing now is that 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.939
 question poses you must also conditionally 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.710
 we were there full power in it 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.439
 have beaten the police and 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.960
 everything on it and at once before that 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.630
 Cologne Cathedral sounds and there is one playing 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.819
 piano maker that was the people 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.380
 but there are not so brutal and 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.259
 so on that a camel plays 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.299
 practically 5000 or 6000 people on 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.429
 once it can practically calm down 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.429
 finished a great thing well 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.889
 the iss threatens a collision in space 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.319
 with space junk you will get to it 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.810
 what should that then how do the root act 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.539
 cause the collision of the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.700
 space junk should the danger he comes 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.340
 then seemed to prepare for the earth 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.650
 possible 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.940
 there does not come on the earth there is above 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.000
 into space etc 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.610
 at height in the stratosphere is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.580
 scrap everything that's handy there 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.890
 flies so it could be 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.780
 Coming to think about it is one thing 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.910
 just as a car will then find 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.860
 I'll be fine though 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.670
 next topic every sixth in 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.360
 Germany is affected by poverty 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.569
 why is it still when the economy 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.630
 if the whole production is everything 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.349
 stagnates when people on their 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.470
 dismissal 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:53.069
 say today today then they have today 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.260
 she stated i talked you talk 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.870
 again in between that fumble me 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.810
 he'll have another look like madonna 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.060
 Let's talk to a dog, please 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.629
 ingrid you have you always without skin 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.629
 rebuked 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.549
 you finally did not hit him 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:24.150
 then until next week this is not 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.120
 usually that's what I want to do 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.120
 that he cuts twice
