00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.540 

this<00:01:44.960> year<00:01:45.020> like<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.190> have<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.400> little

this year like you can you have a little

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.170 
this year like you can you have a little
curve<00:01:46.880> line<00:01:47.180> there<00:01:47.510> it's<00:01:48.460> way<00:01:49.460> more<00:01:49.490> streets

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
curve line there it's way more streets

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.160 
curve line there it's way more streets
capable<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:50.780> oriented<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.560> year<00:01:53.020> that's<00:01:54.020> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
capable and oriented this year that's a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.660 
capable and oriented this year that's a
big<00:01:54.380> step<00:01:54.620> up<00:01:54.800> right<00:01:55.010> there<00:01:55.220> like<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.580> way

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
big step up right there like the way

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.390 
big step up right there like the way
shuffles<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.390> around<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.750> backside<00:01:56.930> flip

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
shuffles out around the backside flip

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.219 
shuffles out around the backside flip
and<00:01:58.400> I<00:01:58.550> think<00:01:58.759> he<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.540> make<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.900> final

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
and I think he just to make it the final

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.780
