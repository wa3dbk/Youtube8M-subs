00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
seen that I am going to post a picture

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
seen that I am going to post a picture
with<00:00:37.230> him<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.219> other<00:00:38.250> Totoro<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.940> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
with him and the other Totoro that I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.220 
with him and the other Totoro that I
made<00:00:39.770> anyway<00:00:40.770> um<00:00:41.010> he<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.030> much<00:00:42.750> smaller<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
made anyway um he is much smaller and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680 
made anyway um he is much smaller and
has<00:00:43.500> less<00:00:44.370> markings<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> older<00:00:45.300> one

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
has less markings on the older one

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
has less markings on the older one
I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> markings<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.039> bigger<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.460> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I think the markings are bigger for this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.560 
I think the markings are bigger for this
one<00:00:47.730> too<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.829> eyes<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.340> used<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.329> same

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
one too and the eyes I used are the same

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
one too and the eyes I used are the same
ones<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.860> used<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> old<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.670> these

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
ones as I used for the old one these

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
ones as I used for the old one these
ones<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> ones<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.780> had<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> put<00:00:55.230> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
ones are the ones that you had to put in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
ones are the ones that you had to put in
before<00:00:55.649> closing<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> doll

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
before closing up the doll

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.670 
before closing up the doll
yeah<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
yeah and for for this one actually I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.969 
yeah and for for this one actually I
forgot<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:03.180> put<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> eyes<00:01:03.809> before<00:01:04.650> closing

forgot to put in the eyes before closing

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
forgot to put in the eyes before closing
so<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.420> had<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.409> open<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.070> back<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.700> um<00:01:09.650> yeah

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
so I had to open it back up and um yeah

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
so I had to open it back up and um yeah
put<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> eyes<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.090> yeah<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.600> forget<00:01:12.810> to

put on the eyes but yeah don't forget to
do<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> pain<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.700> redo<00:01:15.240> the

do that because it is a pain to redo the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.210 
do that because it is a pain to redo the
doll<00:01:15.689> after<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> finished<00:01:16.560> everything<00:01:17.009> and

kind<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> sticking<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.630> this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it is just a huge circle so I just made

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.859 
it is just a huge circle so I just made
that<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> sewed<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.030> him<00:01:36.390> before<00:01:36.570> I

that and then I sewed it on him before I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.460 
that and then I sewed it on him before I
did<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.250> part<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:39.869> found<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.140> easier

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
did this this part and I found it easier

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.700 
did this this part and I found it easier
to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.159> way<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> kind

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
to do that way because this one I kind

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
to do that way because this one I kind
of<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.950> tried<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> stretch<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.030> bit

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of just tried to stretch it a little bit

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.960 
of just tried to stretch it a little bit
more<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.280> take<00:01:47.280> most<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
more so that it would take most of it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.920 
more so that it would take most of it
most<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.380> front<00:01:49.649> part<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.600> because<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
most of the front part up because if it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.620 
most of the front part up because if it
doesn't<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.680> kind<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.189> looks<00:01:53.630> looks

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
doesn't do that it kind of looks looks

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
doesn't do that it kind of looks looks
like<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.960> lacking<00:01:55.170> over<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.009> side

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
like it's lacking over here on this side

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.429 
like it's lacking over here on this side
and<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.610> side<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> had<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and on this side so I had to kind of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
and on this side so I had to kind of
stretch<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.969> better

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
stretch it a little bit so it's better

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.569 
stretch it a little bit so it's better
to<00:02:00.570> sew<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.649> before<00:02:02.070> putting<00:02:02.430> this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
to sew this on first before putting this

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
to sew this on first before putting this
on<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.390> look<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
on because it could look kind of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.940 
on because it could look kind of
distorted<00:02:04.939> yeah<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.500> simple

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
distorted yeah so that is pretty simple

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
distorted yeah so that is pretty simple
it's<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> circle<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.950> have

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it's just like a circle and then I have

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.520 
it's just like a circle and then I have
the<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.030> ears

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
the the ears
it's<00:02:14.220> kind<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> short<00:02:15.120> stalk<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it's kind of like a short stalk here and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.330 
it's kind of like a short stalk here and
then<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.020> kind<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.260> goes<00:02:16.440> up<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> ball<00:02:17.070> kind
