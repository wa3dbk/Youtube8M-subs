doing an awesome job another person may
not<00:02:48.700> there<00:02:49.239> are<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.570> many<00:02:49.630> factors<00:02:49.780> to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
not there are so many factors to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.039 
not there are so many factors to
consider<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:52.269> know<00:02:52.360> what's<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> density<00:02:52.989> of

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
consider you know what's the density of

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.410 
consider you know what's the density of
the<00:02:53.140> wood<00:02:53.260> what's<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.830> conditions<00:02:54.280> outside

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the wood what's the conditions outside

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.910 
the wood what's the conditions outside
what's<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> technique<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.080> user<00:02:56.260> you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
what's the technique of the user you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.870 
what's the technique of the user you
know<00:02:57.010> maybe<00:02:57.280> they<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.489> don't<00:02:57.700> know<00:02:57.730> how<00:02:57.850> to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
know maybe they just don't know how to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.850 
know maybe they just don't know how to
chop<00:02:58.090> wood<00:02:58.120> very<00:02:58.360> good<00:02:58.600> I'm<00:02:59.080> not<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.350> best<00:02:59.530> you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
chop wood very good I'm not the best you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.530 
chop wood very good I'm not the best you
know<00:02:59.890> as<00:03:00.549> far<00:03:00.580> as<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.910> technique<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.390> me

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
know as far as the technique of me

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.539 
know as far as the technique of me
chopping<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.019> know<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.290> idea<00:03:02.440> behind<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.980> but

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
chopping I know the idea behind it but

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.949 
chopping I know the idea behind it but
sometimes<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.060> go<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.570> got<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.780> chop

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
sometimes you go to you got to chop

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.810 
sometimes you go to you got to chop
something<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.530> miss<00:03:05.739> your<00:03:06.190> fatigue<00:03:06.579> I'm

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
out here working for hours at a time

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.949 
out here working for hours at a time
sometimes<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.130> know<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.209> mean<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.600> miss<00:03:10.780> one

sometimes you know and I mean I miss one

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.289 
sometimes you know and I mean I miss one
so<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.230> missed<00:03:11.440> twice<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.519> not<00:03:12.640> chunking

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
so I missed twice and it's not chunking

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.580 
so I missed twice and it's not chunking
out<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.510> wood<00:03:13.660> as<00:03:13.810> nice<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.200> saw<00:03:14.380> someone

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
out the wood as nice as you saw someone

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.170 
out the wood as nice as you saw someone
else<00:03:14.769> do<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.670> hasn't<00:03:15.820> really<00:03:16.060> no

there<00:03:20.110> are<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.290> many<00:03:20.620> factors<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:21.370> are

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
there are so many factors that are

on<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.660> particular<00:03:55.840> product<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.920> that's<00:03:57.070> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
on that particular product so that's it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.370 
on that particular product so that's it
just<00:03:57.730> want<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:57.970> mention<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.210> real<00:03:58.450> quick<00:03:58.660> got

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
just want to mention that real quick got

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.990 
just want to mention that real quick got
some<00:03:59.500> other<00:03:59.620> blades<00:03:59.800> out<00:03:59.920> here<00:04:00.190> I'm<00:04:00.820> not<00:04:00.940> sure

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
some other blades out here I'm not sure

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000 
some other blades out here I'm not sure
from<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.420> film<00:04:01.660> at<00:04:01.750> all<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.110> like<00:04:02.710> doing<00:04:02.860> stuff

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
from the film at all I like doing stuff

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.890 
from the film at all I like doing stuff
like<00:04:03.100> this<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.520> I<00:04:03.610> think<00:04:03.820> what<00:04:04.420> happens<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:04.780> if

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
like this but I think what happens is if

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.470 
like this but I think what happens is if
I<00:04:04.990> film<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.500> know<00:04:06.220> 10<00:04:06.520> videos<00:04:06.910> just<00:04:07.240> like<00:04:07.330> this
