00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 before someone wants to sell them 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 I'm going to practice a different idea 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.210
 this comet that soma stern or also 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.080
 the c 2011 l 4 a comet that since 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 2011 we had talked and what is supposed 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.170
 will be the comet of the decade because 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.230
 because it is expected it may be 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.989
 visible and that we may be seeing 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.379
 during a good time this comet then 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.030
 in the sky not in the nights not yet 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.140
 you know what the level of the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.480
 brightness you have is or will happen very close 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 in quotation marks of the earth 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 approximately the same distance as 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.229
 we have from the earth to the sun 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 and the important thing is I will tell you more than 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.509
 everything is that it will be visibly 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.430
 interesting even if it was not very 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.479
 and bright to the naked eye 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.060
 I could observe you could even see 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.429
 with some small binocular videos 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 to a small and good telescope 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.610
 obviously the bigger the more 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 you can see much better for now from this 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.310
 comet that has been coming out in some 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.860
 media a little alarmist saying that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.049
 is going to get very close to the land and the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 calculation that I tell you is a calculation 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.849
 quite sure is a calculation that then 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.649
 have the sources let's say fairs and 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.140
 the calculation they have from the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.380
 distance from the earth to the sun so it's 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.539
 a distance quite large 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.939
 they have passed kites in fact at distances 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.799
 much smaller comets then 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.619
 considerably large even 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.539
 close or as close as what it is 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.989
 the distance from here to the moon 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.019
 there are other comments of which others 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.299
 rather steroids are not visible in 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.019
 this time this is visible because 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.989
 It has a small scene but when it is 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.709
 a rock without wake there is when you can 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.409
 be more dangerous because you can not see 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.620
 and it is that we are in an ocean in a 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.709
 kind of ocean that at some point 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.959
 then you hit something like for example if 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.030
 we were a small raft in the ocean 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.540
 well, something at some point we will play with 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.500
 some but with some debris not 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.430
 but normally this type of meteorites 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.060
 that falls on earth are very small 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.900
 at the time you are in the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.120
 earth facing an asteroid a 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.680
 little bigger then there we will be 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.319
 talking about who are going to take 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.769
 surely other measures for now the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.780
 sky is very little very little observed 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.310
 we do not have the feeling that there 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.750
 many telescopes around the world and 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.170
 everyone is watching the gas towards 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.950
 the sky the calculation that is had of 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.700
 how much percent of the sky is 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.810
 is observing is very minimal is less 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.209
 there is really little that is observing 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.329
 the sky that is very vast and because the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.970
 angles are so many do not and because also 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.919
 As I tell you, you have to remember that 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.739
 stones the rocks that do not have a wake 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.500
 they are not visible until that wake does not 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.659
 cover some star that you remember 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.450
 that she was she does not realize that 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.459
 something comes not something is covering that 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.180
 star and then when they sound the 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.400
 alarms and all this so then 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.650
 surely at some point in the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.700
 history of the human being we will face 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.790
 some 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.400
 and we'll see how it goes and what happens 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.849
 it really can be tomorrow can be 10 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 years 100 years 1000 years really do not know 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.940
 know so for now, we are 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.220
 documenting about this comet and good 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.919
 do not come to another catastrophic idea 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.330
 especially if this comet is enough 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:26.270
 quite not, it surely is 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.790
 it will simply be something worth seeing in 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.790
 the nights and to comment until then
