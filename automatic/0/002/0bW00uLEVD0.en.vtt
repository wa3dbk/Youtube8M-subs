00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
cheese knife we can't bump into this as
a<00:00:46.200> possibility<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.180> for

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
a possibility it's really good for

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
a possibility it's really good for
making<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.079> lemon<00:00:49.440> slices<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.980> garnishes

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.219 

and<00:01:24.930> forward<00:01:25.680> into<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.190> pitcher<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.110> said<00:01:28.110> we

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and forward into the pitcher I said we

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.780 
and forward into the pitcher I said we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.040 
and what another court and the sugar and
we'll<00:01:32.790> mix<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.180> Hanks<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:33.930> we're

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
we'll mix it up with Hanks or when we're

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:48.850 
we'll mix it up with Hanks or when we're
done<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.820> here's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.380> second<00:01:37.380> one

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.100 

there's<00:01:49.610> nothing<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.000> that<00:01:50.180> fresh<00:01:50.570> lemon

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
there's nothing like that fresh lemon

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.230 
there's nothing like that fresh lemon
juice<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.800> really<00:01:52.340> make<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.520> for<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.850> case<00:01:53.060> of

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
juice to really make it for a case of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.650 
juice to really make it for a case of
tree<00:01:53.620> I'm<00:01:54.620> go<00:01:54.710> ahead<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.220> cut<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.760> lemon<00:01:56.000> using

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
tree I'm go ahead and cut a lemon using

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.840 
tree I'm go ahead and cut a lemon using
that<00:01:56.780> cheese<00:01:57.080> knife<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.640> see<00:01:58.820> that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
that cheese knife so you can see that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.690 
that cheese knife so you can see that
this<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.600> little<00:01:59.780> bit<00:01:59.960> longer<00:02:00.110> blade<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.670> I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
this is a little bit longer blade so I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.030 
this is a little bit longer blade so I
think<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.210> makes<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> real<00:02:03.080> nice<00:02:03.260> if<00:02:03.800> we<00:02:04.010> were

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
think that makes it real nice if we were

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.800 
think that makes it real nice if we were
doing<00:02:04.640> lemon<00:02:05.450> wedges<00:02:07.149> this<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.330> what<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:08.660> can

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
doing lemon wedges this is what you can

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:29.050 
doing lemon wedges this is what you can
do<00:02:08.960> real<00:02:09.320> easily

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.360 

I<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.840> I'll<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.500> go<00:02:30.680> ahead<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.010> add<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
I think I'll just go ahead and add the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.250 
I think I'll just go ahead and add the
sugar<00:02:31.610> again<00:02:32.300> we're<00:02:32.480> going<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.660> do<00:02:32.780> four<00:02:33.110> to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
sugar again we're going to do four to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.220 
sugar again we're going to do four to
six<00:02:33.709> lemons<00:02:34.459> but<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:35.480> kind<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.840> cut<00:02:36.080> to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
six lemons but I think we kind of cut to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.870 
six lemons but I think we kind of cut to
the<00:02:36.319> chase<00:02:36.349> here<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.010> show<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.430> overall

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
the chase here and show the overall

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.570 
the chase here and show the overall
production

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.030 

yeah<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.720> final<00:02:44.080> step<00:02:44.200> will<00:02:44.440> be<00:02:44.470> taken<00:02:44.830> and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
yeah the final step will be taken and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.580 
yeah the final step will be taken and
Easter<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.460> hang<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.790> up<00:02:49.410> we'll<00:02:50.410> go<00:02:50.440> ahead
