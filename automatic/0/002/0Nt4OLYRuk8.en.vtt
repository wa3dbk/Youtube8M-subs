00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.560
 hi are never ruschetti of salumi are 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.900
 responsible for the masters ' athletes 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.650
 the young people of Italy, however, really work 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.679
 in marketing promotion 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.130
 let sport I present the new range 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:24.980
 of ski salmo starting from the team 2 say 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.520
 stello crc pescar gs very structured 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:35.030
 very nice with divided into three sizes 100 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:37.309
 75 71 185 178 is a ski with the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.470
 construction of the monocoque and with the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.140
 peculiarity of the power line is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.809
 inserted within this of this 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.629
 channel with rubber polymers that 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.000
 they hold down the arm help the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.760
 ski arm to break up the eyes 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.559
 therefore to keep it always stable and fixed 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.589
 on the snow a very maneuverable ski 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.409
 being a king he digs in giant shoes 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.580
 and can be used by top skiers 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.580
 medium to high level 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.010
 here we have the e'quipe 3 of pisa la mole 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 figures I would say that it is a sla non card 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.260
 so why the tightest ones always with 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.510
 a monocoque structure this time 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.580
 one discovered double tania ie one 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.770
 inside the other with the particularity 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.979
 of the powerline also inserted 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.619
 inside the ski with polymers that 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.390
 see these these vines fear the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.690
 rubber polymers to hold more species 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 atrocious ski very stable very versatile 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.340
 and then for skiers to these 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.340
 high level of high millions from 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.220
 and who 24 hours skiing one hundred percent 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.320
 track that we were proposing this year is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.900
 already a ski that has collected a lot 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 success in the past seasons 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.360
 let's say that a sci fi sandwich with 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.640
 side with straight side but with two 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.120
 upper and one kitano floors 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.010
 lower than the powerline in the summer of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.890
 ski center not with polymers for 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.350
 fix the ski but it is wrapped in football 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.380
 a rubber to be able to absorb the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.560
 vibrations did not come out dedicated to one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.540
 great kingdoms of skiers and it is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.850
 dedicated is precisely called 24 hours 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.700
 fast that you can use for the whole 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.590
 day in a note clearly but not 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.360
 tired because it helps the skier a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.360
 take yourself to have fun 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.520
 endura xt800 slightly roker ski 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.090
 ease and the salon that the dedicated ski 70 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.650
 per cent runway 33100 off the track at one 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.060
 quite important structure also 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.560
 of resignation is important indeed to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 8 under the foot 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.180
 it is called 800 memo per 80 mm lot 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.190
 under the foot 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.560
 the particularity that makes it very 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.760
 stable on hard snow on the track but a lot 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.480
 versatile off the track and this powerline 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.730
 double which is going to continue below 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.280
 the attack is also distributed on the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.950
 queue this makes it a lot of skiing 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.320
 stable but also very versatile is one 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.650
 kato scenes has excellent skiers at a 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.709
 level of medium-high ray of spinners but 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.010
 can entertain both on the track and on 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.880
 nevis disconnected disconnected lists 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.880
 but also off the track 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.900
 origin bamboo and skiing for the woman who 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.610
 salamon places the track in 70 percent 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.270
 30 percent off the track 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.720
 indeed, one hundred per cent sorry, one track 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.340
 very easy light structured ski 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 even for the woman moved a little more 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.519
 forward with the attack is moved right 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.560
 forward structure always monocoque but 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.290
 with the wooden interior especially the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.050
 part towards the edges internally 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.120
 where you see these two arrests we say 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.640
 these two spaces these two figures 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.730
 invested in swiss frames has practically 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.200
 of bamboo than a very light wood but 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.710
 also very elastic which gives a nice 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.400
 good senior-level response 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.400
 for the woman 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:57.010
 salomon bbr 8.9 on the shape ski 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:01.260
 also called the shark as to the form 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:05.110
 It is a very tip operated ski jar 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.560
 important in front and a lot more tail 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.110
 hold 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.510
 This is the shape that allows 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.350
 having fun both on and off the track 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.479
 it is an exit track, however, considered a 70 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.220
 percent off the track because of these 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.830
 size but a ski strictly the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.650
 planned simple construction too 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.639
 this your right side with two blades 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.260
 by titta nun which has the peculiarity of 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.139
 to entertain the skier who is 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.380
 he wants where he wants to use both medium to one 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.380
 high level
