00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
start to introduced in 1992 there was a

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.030 
start to introduced in 1992 there was a
short<00:01:31.310> period<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.900> 1998<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.170> 1999<00:01:33.439> where<00:01:33.950> they

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
short period in 1998 and 1999 where they

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.359 
short period in 1998 and 1999 where they
were<00:01:34.360> reusing<00:01:35.360> copper<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:39.130> happens<00:01:40.130> when

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
were reusing copper it happens when

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.690 
were reusing copper it happens when
obviously<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.060> value<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.020> metal

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
obviously the value of the metal

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.890 
obviously the value of the metal
rises<00:01:43.700> above<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.000> actual<00:01:44.119> face<00:01:44.450> value<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
rises above the actual face value of the

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.330 
rises above the actual face value of the
coin<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.840> just<00:01:47.840> give<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.020> an<00:01:48.110> example<00:01:48.409> an<00:01:49.159> old

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
coin so just give you an example an old

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.530 
coin so just give you an example an old
2p<00:01:49.909> from<00:01:50.150> before<00:01:51.430> 1992<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.850> actually<00:01:53.270> closer

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
2p from before 1992 is actually closer

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.130 
2p from before 1992 is actually closer
to<00:01:53.750> four<00:01:53.960> pence<00:01:54.200> copper<00:01:54.770> Valley<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.780> can

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
to four pence copper Valley so you can

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.330 
to four pence copper Valley so you can
understand<00:01:57.560> why<00:01:57.770> it's<00:01:57.979> actually<00:01:58.040> worth

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
understand why it's actually worth

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.490 
understand why it's actually worth
hanging<00:01:58.610> on<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.850> these<00:01:59.090> as<00:01:59.869> they<00:02:00.110> did<00:02:00.290> with<00:02:00.409> the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
hanging on to these as they did with the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.429 
hanging on to these as they did with the
silver<00:02:00.770> coins<00:02:00.979> back<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.079> 40s

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
sorry steel from the copper is the use

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.500 
sorry steel from the copper is the use
of<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.569> magnet<00:03:06.909> obviously<00:03:07.909> copper<00:03:08.239> big
