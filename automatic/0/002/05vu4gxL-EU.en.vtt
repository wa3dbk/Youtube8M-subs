00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.880
 when it comes to maximum traction for 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.770
 to provide wide working widths 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 and at the same time protect the soil 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.590
 work 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.580
 then the quad truck tractors play 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.470
 by casey h has been at the forefront since 1997 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.720
 the manufacturer with these vehicles in 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.820
 Europe on the market now put the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.280
 americans a new generation of theirs 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.260
 crawler knuckle on one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.540
 arable farm in Upper Austria 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 we with the top model the quad trucks 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.830
 620 went hunting on the hunt 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.210
 we also have this opportunity 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.200
 a look at the technical 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200
 innovations thrown 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.750
 the new series comprises a total of five 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.790
 Models in the performance range of 457 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.100
 to 6 128 ps 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.530
 meet the three stronger types 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 Already the exhaust stage animal 4 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.350
 final 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.230
 The designers rely on one 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.760
 scr only solution what is behind it 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.170
 explains product marketing manager 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.780
 norbert teeth 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.640
 we have extended the scr concept 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.250
 have a new name for it 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.440
 if it is high efficient scr 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.130
 the special thing is that we are here 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.390
 have found a pure sca uni solution 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.950
 and thus reach level 4 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.860
 the whole thing works technically like that 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.440
 that to the optimized scr catalyst 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.200
 now a dieselloc situation 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 filter is connected upstream and we with it 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.070
 Of course the limits can be met 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.420
 the efficiency of the scr catalyst 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.720
 is now going from 85 percent to 95 percent 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.780
 increased so that we the nx values the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.970
 from 2014 we will be required 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.950
 to keep up with it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.680
 the technology for exhaust aftertreatment 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.840
 was integrated into the exhaust of the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.130
 sitting in front of the cabin left so he 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.890
 the driver's field of vision is not 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.200
 restricts 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.860
 in quad support 620 operates a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.319
 six cylinder cursor motor from fpt 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.130
 12 9 liters of displacement, he draws one 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.790
 rating of 628 ps the maximum 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.860
 engine power is 6 192 ps the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.690
 highest torque at just under 3000 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.849
 newton meters 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.890
 with two intercoolers casey h 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.550
 the thermal efficiency in the engine 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.890
 improve 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.140
 Despite the large vehicle dimensions 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.140
 the maintenance points are easily accessible 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.520
 For long working days the quad truck has 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.240
 1900 liters diesel and 320 liters adblue 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.240
 on board 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.200
 the trademark of the quad truck are 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.060
 his four crawler drives with it sets 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.460
 he has the enormous engine power ground 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.130
 gently in traction around the empty weight 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.730
 of 25 tons is distributed to one 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.690
 footprint of 56 square meters 60 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.330
 percent in front 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.350
 40 percent rear additional ballast 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.350
 not necessary 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.460
 the fully synchronized full power 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.920
 shift gear offers 16 forward and 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.680
 two reverse gears the automatic 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.060
 productivity management apm chooses 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.060
 automatically the best combination 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.320
 Output and engine speed of the driver 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.310
 just have the desired speed 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.310
 pretend 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.690
 thanks to the articulated steering, the quad 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.540
 truck in contrast to conventional 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.140
 track tractors ground gently 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.140
 and turn 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.530
 In the middle, the vehicle twists 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.780
 by up to 13 degrees on both sides the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.820
 individual tracked drives are around 10 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.310
 Grad swiveled up and down 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.290
 this reduces soil compaction and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.970
 provides one in every situation 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.640
 large surface contact safe with 7 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.520
 110 mm wide bands has the quad 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.650
 Truck an outside width of two meters 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.460
 99 so he may also on public 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.460
 driving on the streets 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.700
 the top speed is 37 km 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.830
 h in the rear is a strong too standard 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.140
 there is also a commute on request 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.690
 a hack kraft lift with up to nine 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.080
 tons of lifting power and a thousand hectares 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.080
 source 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.400
 At our use we have with the 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.960
 factory available automatic track 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.240
 worked 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.370
 It increases the floor space performance 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.580
 the operating costs and relieves the 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.580
 driver 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.560
 the workplace is more comfortable 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.689
 become the new cab suspension 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.099
 absorbs shocks in and across 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.479
 driving direction and improves so 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.479
 effective driving comfort 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.039
 in the right armrest one finds the 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.900
 Multi controller of the latest generation 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.120
 the b-team concept was created by the 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.610
 taken over smaller tractor series 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.319
 In addition, there are now new wide angle 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.960
 mirror with electric adjustment and 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.539
 a ventilated driver's seat around 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.310
 Turn 40 degrees 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.050
 furthermore Casey h offers his kink 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.719
 handlebar also in the steiger version 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.289
 with wheels on the technology is the same as 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.289
 in the nonsense 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.889
 the exact prices for the new ones 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.860
 Tractors are not fixed yet 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:22.060
 for the previous top model quad day 600 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.439
 you had to spend at least 500 51,000 euros 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.569
 including VAT 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:30.099
 that the successor is not cheaper 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.099
 actually explains itself 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.700
 more information about the new quad 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.060
 You can find tractors from casey h online 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.490
 on www.landwirt.com and in the issue 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.210
 17 20 13 10 of the advanced
