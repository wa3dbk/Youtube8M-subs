wig the lace on it is still very very
brittle<00:00:47.460> almost<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.469> really

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
brittle almost so you have to be really

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180 
brittle almost so you have to be really
really<00:00:49.950> careful<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.750> because<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
really careful with it because it is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.479 
really careful with it because it is
easy<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.000> tear<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:56.030> after<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> full<00:00:57.300> day<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
easy to tear and after a full day of

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.420 
easy to tear and after a full day of
using<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.559> spare<00:01:01.559> gum<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:05.189> using

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
using the spare gum it is and I'm using

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.020 
using the spare gum it is and I'm using
the<00:01:05.729> spirit<00:01:06.030> gum<00:01:06.240> matte<00:01:06.540> finish<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the spirit gum matte finish and it is it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510 
the spirit gum matte finish and it is it
dries<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.110> almost<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> white<00:01:11.010> underneath

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
dries to almost like a white underneath

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
dries to almost like a white underneath
the<00:01:12.060> lace<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.840> um<00:01:15.049> there<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.350> another<00:01:16.710> spirit

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the lace so um there is another spirit

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.390 
the lace so um there is another spirit
gum<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.360> lady<00:01:18.600> had<00:01:18.810> shopped

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
gum and I think the lady had shopped

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.999 
gum and I think the lady had shopped
lace<00:01:20.400> wigs<00:01:20.759> she<00:01:21.570> mixed<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> may

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
lace wigs she mixed the two and that may

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.039 
lace wigs she mixed the two and that may
be<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> reason<00:01:23.490> why<00:01:23.880> she's<00:01:24.210> mixing<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> two

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
be the reason why she's mixing the two

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
be the reason why she's mixing the two
because<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> matte<00:01:25.890> dries<00:01:26.820> very<00:01:27.509> dry<00:01:28.700> excuse

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because the matte dries very dry excuse

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.990 
because the matte dries very dry excuse
