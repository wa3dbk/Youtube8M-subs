00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.510
 then the first thing to do is to 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.660
 find a nettle hostel that you do n't 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.780
 know 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.640
 in short, fine as you see here 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.130
 always being careful using 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.500
 always how many because the hairs of the 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.199
 of the nettle are those that carry the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.949
 Reactive reaction therefore it will begin 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.529
 get the balls out but take this instead 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.249
 kind of stem here already beautiful often 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.770
 see this this is a lot here 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.320
 thick and therefore easy to work 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.820
 that one is a type of nettle that is 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.470
 located only in particularly areas 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.360
 moist otherwise the nettle is much 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.490
 fine and cannot be processed type 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.940
 these systems you see here are beautiful 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.400
 thick 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.190
 once you find the stem this is it 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:01:00.329
 nice big and so can be 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.329
 worked well it is cut says 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.729
 this is nice often an inch of 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.439
 diameter is more than good you can 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.789
 use the two procedures or stop a 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:30.320
 bath goes nettle or crushes a 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:32.119
 po style it this way at this point 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.759
 take a small knife by doing 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.759
 attention to these knots cut in half 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.619
 [Applause] 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:51.020
 may midway through ortiga once I have 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:55.289
 divided main show 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 after the pulp inside and the spirit 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.420
 slowly leaving the fiber intact 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 you see 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.720
 I will get into the fibers that are served 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.940
 they are very resistant with this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.780
 I can also make strings for strings 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.959
 etc. etc. 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.379
 we could make a small frame a 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.230
 this point takes a piece of fiber 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:29.170
 nettle and began to spin in this 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.790
 way up rote hours or three wheels up to 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.160
 get some kind of loops so ok 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.370
 this point I start to weave the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.680
 rope as you have braided the rope 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:49.510
 will have two flaps the first flap is a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:51.720
 second I make two turns to the right and one to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 left 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:01.140
 two turns to the right and one to the left e 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 continue a drawing of this type well 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.670
 see how very durable 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.190
 the fiber ends up taking another piece of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.019
 I wear fiber 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.690
 parallel to what has remained the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.690
 I will continue the work eventually 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.900
 something like that are small 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.069
 fibers that can be between them 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.389
 entwined and can create a rope 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.470
 a little bigger than that of simona 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.900
 what we need 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.780
 if you pay attention you see it is very much 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.850
 resistant you see is like a one 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.920
 very strong hemp cord 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.049
 consider this type of fiber 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.160
 body can also be used for large 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:54.010
 traction type with the bow or as cords 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.410
 to make a shelter for the races something 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.549
 is a lortic fiber located 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.609
 practically everywhere in the Italian woods 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.669
 and therefore it is easy to use 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.139
 realization 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.460
 let's say to dry a cord of 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:13.100
 this that 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.470
 and fresh see taken this morning 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.510
 fresh it takes at least two three days 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.940
 you realize that then it becomes del 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.950
 the same flight of the hemp then a 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.270
 light brown a badge that is of the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.090
 same as hemp and can 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.090
 be and get even more resistance 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.830
 ok thanks to the next
