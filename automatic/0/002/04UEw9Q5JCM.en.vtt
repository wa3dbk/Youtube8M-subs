and get quite a bit of them and it was

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.480 
and get quite a bit of them and it was
like<00:01:53.970> ten<00:01:54.270> dollars<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:55.049> something

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
like ten dollars or something

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.170 
like ten dollars or something

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
but blue yellow and other stuff to match

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.990 
but blue yellow and other stuff to match
the<00:01:59.720> lighting<00:02:00.079> conditions<00:02:03.100> memory<00:02:04.100> cards<00:02:04.759> I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the lighting conditions memory cards I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.780 
the lighting conditions memory cards I
like<00:02:05.360> 10<00:02:06.170> gigabytes<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.950> memory<00:02:07.130> which<00:02:07.369> I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
like 10 gigabytes of memory which I

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.530 
like 10 gigabytes of memory which I
don't<00:02:08.149> really<00:02:08.509> ever<00:02:08.810> use<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.289> much<00:02:10.540> once

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
don't really ever use that much once

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.160 
don't really ever use that much once
lower<00:02:12.849> 11<00:02:13.849> spend<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.510> works<00:02:14.780> pretty<00:02:15.050> well

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
lower 11 spend this works pretty well

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
lower 11 spend this works pretty well
but<00:02:15.349> I've<00:02:15.920> had<00:02:16.130> this<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> year<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.000> a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
but I've had this for like a year and a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.479 
but I've had this for like a year and a
half<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.450> probably<00:02:17.720> need<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.050> replace<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.530> and

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
half I probably need to replace it and

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.620 
half I probably need to replace it and
then<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.720> 77<00:02:20.720> millimeter<00:02:21.140> circular<00:02:21.980> polarizer

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
then a 77 millimeter circular polarizer

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.420 
then a 77 millimeter circular polarizer
and<00:02:24.040> that's<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.340> really<00:02:25.880> think<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.720> need

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
and that's all I really think I need

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.770 
and that's all I really think I need
most<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.610> time<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.299> really<00:02:32.540> small

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
most of time and this is a really small

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.620 
most of time and this is a really small
