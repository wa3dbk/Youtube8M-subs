00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 good morning to all from san g 27 tot that 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.310
 yesterday brought me that today I will make some video 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.230
 different from the usual 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 because I usually take care of more than 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.710
 analysis rather than theories why 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 I think the last word anyway 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 always or often so many 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 theories you see around come 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 shoot from the same manga but today there 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 I try anyway let's say from the trio of which 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.180
 talk to the flamingo looking after that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.890
 the others of the flamingo and his crew e 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 his family 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.910
 we know that he will have to mingo 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.030
 belonged belongs to one of those 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.540
 families that are bitter 800 years ago 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.969
 giova founded what is the current 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 I govern the world government and therefore 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.370
 has a past as a heavenly dragon 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.920
 however we know that his family is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
 currently this no longer has this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.020
 assignment as on this role but precisely 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.829
 yes we say so transferred here 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.690
 the question that came to my mind 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 to this but if in the crew nest 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.629
 flamingo there were currently some of his 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 familiar then other nobles this me 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.540
 came following chapter 724 where 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.290
 you can see it from flamingo seriously 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.420
 worried when lab holds hostage 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 region just like all this 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 concern here who he really is 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.689
 plays for example if he was a ruler 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.689
 video I call a relative a grandmother one 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.939
 great aunt here is in my opinion not a thing 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.079
 so far-fetched if we look 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.340
 the very ones that are the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.049
 characteristics of the crew indeed yes 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 may notice several characters that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.579
 they resemble each other 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.720
 in the look in style as precisely 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.490
 they play a wise match and I have this 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 idea here I made myself in my opinion the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.950
 flamingo germany is divided into two 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.290
 categories 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.170
 on the one hand there are those characters 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.330
 such as 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.909
 may be a violet they were 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.830
 we say forced to be part of China 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.439
 in fact we know that bayonetta dei 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.619
 resentments against one of the 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.380
 signs three goals and therefore have been 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.420
 forced to stay in the crew ea 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.030
 take part on the other side 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.980
 I see a number of members who could 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.610
 belong to the donkey family 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.890
 yacht and I am referring to a bond 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 of blood in particular in four that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.090
 appear in the tournament 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.910
 therefore mr pink of the inamam the ogm 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.480
 twice I think they could have a 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.500
 own close bond against crime 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.190
 same 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.209
 this is because the family of 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.549
 will have to be minimal being a noble family 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.000
 you really think that a family 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.350
 so important that it was 800 years ago 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.440
 among those who founded a government 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.290
 World it is so disunited for so 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.239
 scattered here I honestly do not believe 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.350
 we know how the celestial dragons are 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.190
 noble families are so closed 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.720
 perched we say between them so 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.940
 I don't see anything strange even if the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.180
 flamingo family was in a certain qual 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.190
 way remained together and therefore if some 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 members of relatives near and far 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.380
 flamingo video itself do 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.079
 currently part of what is yours 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.170
 crew this speech does not apply to i 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.950
 seeds does not apply to signs because precisely 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.390
 we know that the seeds are a bit like arms 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.090
 of friction between millet then those that 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.160
 they have that they are stronger and that they have 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.630
 more responsibility within 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.519
 of his crew for which I think that 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.609
 these have been chosen let's say so 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.450
 based on meritocratic criteria i 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.250
 merit criteria but with regard to 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.769
 precisely the other members such as 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.200
 those who are engaged in the tournament mi 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.079
 this doubt remained 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.989
 here is the view of the middle between 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.080
 bingo as a family in my opinion yes 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.060
 would also explain another 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.270
 couple of questions the first one is that 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.040
 of the age difference that is seen between 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 the members themselves are indeed members 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.850
 like john to the point from now that they seem 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.860
 very old moment elders while 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.300
 others like the ring that seem exactly 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.340
 of children and kids 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.990
 then passing by age as it can 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.299
 be the same as your senior flamingo 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.650
 pink was here then how come 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.299
 so different finger subjects are a part 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.000
 of the same shape perhaps because maybe 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.300
 there is a real bond 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.490
 familiar with each other is another thing 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.410
 would explain the absence in the heirloom 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.700
 family both men fish and 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.260
 subjects different from the breed 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.350
 indeed we know that the nobles 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.610
 world have a vision 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.100
 quite racist of the world and not 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.260
 they intend to mix neither with men 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.150
 real fish to other breeds therefore 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.220
 this would also explain the why in 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.010
 a world as vast and heterogeneous as 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.130
 that of one piece in the leadoff cinema 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.730
 I favino appear simply human and 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.230
 nothing let me know how you think 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.330
 if you also think there is a 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.220
 flamingo and family ties 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.650
 he comes from his crew or if he thinks 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.780
 instead that it is a simple coincidence 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.730
 let me know 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.650
 subscribe to the channel put like it 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.820
 put it does not like short comment 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.710
 and nothing if you see that this video is a 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.720
 unlike the others because with the 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.840
 collaboration of matteo nando who has 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.120
 then lent his video camera 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.050
 also visit his channel 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.050
 nothing goodbye to all
